| 3:32:05| They were in the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12725)|
| 3:32:07| I apologize for that. In the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12727)|
| 3:32:11| So how many acres does that leave outside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12731)|
| 3:32:13| floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12733)|
| 3:32:15| So then that leaves...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12735)|
| 3:32:17| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12737)|
| 3:32:23| It's a weird piece of property the 960 line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| Give you the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12747)|
| 3:32:31| Commissioner Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12751)|
| 3:32:33| unless she's looking that up, could I continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| down? Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12755)|
| 3:32:37| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12757)|
| 3:32:39| I had a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12759)|
| 3:32:41| One for, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12761)|
| 3:32:43| they're both for Director Stone, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12763)|
| 3:32:45| Number one was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12765)|
| 3:32:47| signalization in that specific area. Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12767)|
| 3:32:49| future plans for signalization coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12769)|
| 3:32:51| kind of close to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12771)|
| 3:32:53| with the traffic clutter problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12773)|
| 3:32:57| That was what we prefer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12777)|
| 3:32:59| the intersection there that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12779)|
| 3:33:01| kind of bordered to the adjacent piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| Yeah, we definitely feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| that a traffic signal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12785)|
| 3:33:07| the appropriate fit at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12787)|
| 3:33:09| So that's the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| from basically all angles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| Speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12793)|
| 3:33:15| So that's the field from basically all angles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12795)|
| 3:33:17| Yes, sir. TDOT has concurred with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12797)|
| 3:33:19| They feel like a traffic signal is the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12799)|
| 3:33:21| improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12801)|
| 3:33:23| Mr. Anderson said something about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12803)|
| 3:33:25| 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12805)|
| 3:33:29| 10,000 units of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12809)|
| 3:33:31| dirt or something like that. Can you give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12811)|
| 3:33:33| some kind of brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12813)|
| 3:33:35| idea of what that would do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12815)|
| 3:33:39| Yeah, I can give you an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12819)|
| 3:33:41| It's not a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12821)|
| 3:33:43| amount of dirt to be moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12823)|
| 3:33:45| but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12825)|
| 3:33:47| there's, what, 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12827)|
| 3:33:49| yards in a tandem axle dump truck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12829)|
| 3:33:51| Is that about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12831)|
| 3:33:53| We said 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| Let's say 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12835)|
| 3:33:57| Because I think it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12837)|
| 3:33:59| That's essentially just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| about 750 loads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12841)|
| 3:34:03| of the dirt. I mean, just to kind of give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| a frame of reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12845)|
| 3:34:07| as far as a tandem axle dump truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12847)|
| 3:34:09| I'm just trying to think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12849)|
| 3:34:11| how that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| get in there, the levels and everything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| I'm just trying to see it from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12855)|
| 3:34:17| your perspective, an engineering perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| Commissioner Daley, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12861)|
| 3:34:23| 7.94 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12863)|
| 3:34:27| So that's 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12867)|
| 3:34:29| homes. Yeah, approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12869)|
| 3:34:31| Up there. On that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12871)|
| 3:34:33| piece of property, is that Sandrock Jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12873)|
| 3:34:35| plus the other property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12875)|
| 3:34:41| Which parcel? Was she talking about this one tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12881)|
| 3:34:43| Yeah. I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12883)|
| 3:34:45| We ran the calculator. It was 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12885)|
| 3:34:47| Was I wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12887)|
| 3:34:49| on that, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12889)|
| 3:34:51| Yeah, this is based off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| the calculations that were done by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12893)|
| 3:34:55| Engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12895)|
| 3:34:57| Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12897)|
| 3:34:59| We rounded off to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12899)|
| 3:35:01| 8. 8, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| It's 8 acres times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| 3, which is 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12905)|
| 3:35:07| So you're looking at 24 houses on this one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12907)|
| 3:35:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12909)|
| 3:35:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12911)|
| 3:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12913)|
| 3:35:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12915)|
| 3:35:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12921)|
| 3:35:23| copper medium density on this piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12923)|
| 3:35:25| property, is that a product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12925)|
| 3:35:27| of wanting to concentrate higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| density above the floodplain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12929)|
| 3:35:33| That's a good question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12933)|
| 3:35:35| Commissioner Smith. I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12935)|
| 3:35:37| I wasn't here when that sector plan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| developed and when that was discussed for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| piece of property, but that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| our assumption. Is it based off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12943)|
| 3:35:45| of the FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12945)|
| 3:35:47| maps and the challenges associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12947)|
| 3:35:49| That would have been the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12949)|
| 3:35:51| And this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12951)|
| 3:35:53| downgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12953)|
| 3:35:55| in density from what sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12955)|
| 3:35:57| had planned for this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| Mr. Josh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| I'm going to ask you some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12963)|
| 3:36:05| Please give me honest answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12965)|
| 3:36:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| Take the oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| How much property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12971)|
| 3:36:13| does Smith Build own right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12973)|
| 3:36:15| Raw land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| Right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12977)|
| 3:36:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12979)|
| 3:36:21| In Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12983)|
| 3:36:27| You say thousands of acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12987)|
| 3:36:29| Maybe right at a thousand, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12989)|
| 3:36:31| How many homes have they built in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12991)|
| 3:36:35| This year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12995)|
| 3:36:37| Less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12997)|
| 3:36:39| two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12999)|
| 3:36:41| 700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13001)|
| 3:36:43| With all that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13003)|
| 3:36:45| some of the concerns are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13005)|
| 3:36:47| these houses after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13007)|
| 3:36:49| they're built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13009)|
| 3:36:51| I think Smith Build has done this long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13011)|
| 3:36:53| and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13013)|
| 3:36:55| enough land that if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| wasn't doable on this land, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| go somewhere else and work the next six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13019)|
| 3:37:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13021)|

| 3:37:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13025)|

| 3:37:11| Director Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| you mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| West Emory Road was one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13037)|
| 3:37:19| focal points for improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| both tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13043)|
| 3:37:25| should go through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13045)|
| 3:37:27| and TDOT comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| three years from now and says, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13049)|
| 3:37:31| we can do improvements to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| section, are the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13053)|
| 3:37:35| going to be buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13055)|
| 3:37:37| backyards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13057)|
| 3:37:39| or right-of-way from these two developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| the way the placement of the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13061)|
| 3:37:43| are now, or the way the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13063)|
| 3:37:45| lots are set up now? No, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13065)|
| 3:37:47| from that perspective, this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13067)|
| 3:37:49| and its dedication of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13069)|
| 3:37:51| right-of-way would assist us in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13071)|
| 3:37:53| endeavor. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13073)|
| 3:37:55| this is a major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| so it's probably going to require probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13077)|
| 3:37:59| 44 to 50 feet off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| center line dedication that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13081)|
| 3:38:03| Mr. Sanderson is going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13083)|
| 3:38:05| dedicate to the county, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13085)|
| 3:38:07| if this development does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13087)|
| 3:38:09| go forward, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13089)|
| 3:38:11| better chance than not that the right-of-way acquisitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13091)|
| 3:38:13| will be easier, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13093)|
| 3:38:15| due to the dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13095)|
| 3:38:17| of property of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13097)|
| 3:38:19| Okay. Then I just had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13099)|
| 3:38:21| one more question for Ms. McBee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13101)|
| 3:38:23| Can I stay here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| Yes. In other words, kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13105)|
| 3:38:27| follow-up to Commissioner Daley's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13109)|
| 3:38:31| residents are not concerned about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| water coming off of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13113)|
| 3:38:35| property into Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| You guys are concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13117)|
| 3:38:39| Beaver Creek coming on to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| property. That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| Because the water is going to flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| for the path of least resistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13125)|
| 3:38:47| and that is the path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13129)|
| 3:38:51| Okay. Mr. Snow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| I want to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| something. I think, and this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| very confusing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13137)|
| 3:38:59| I think we, Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| you had said 24 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13141)|
| 3:39:03| That actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13143)|
| 3:39:05| is 34 units. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| we've got a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13147)|
| 3:39:09| bit confused about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13149)|
| 3:39:11| area above the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13151)|
| 3:39:13| no-fill line is 7.94| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13153)|
| 3:39:15| acres. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13155)|
| 3:39:17| and Amy can correct me if I'm wrong, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13157)|
| 3:39:19| area from the, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13159)|
| 3:39:21| the no-fill area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13161)|
| 3:39:23| can be used to calculate density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13163)|
| 3:39:25| And that area is another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| give or take 3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13167)|
| 3:39:29| So technically, the amount of area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| that they're using to calculate density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13171)|
| 3:39:33| is a little over 11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13173)|
| 3:39:35| So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13175)|
| 3:39:37| actually correlates to 34 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13177)|
| 3:39:39| Now, they can't build anything down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13179)|
| 3:39:41| in that area, but they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13181)|
| 3:39:43| use that area for the density calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13183)|
| 3:39:45| if I'm not mistaken. That's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| and I apologize. I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13187)|
| 3:39:49| you said 24, 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13189)|
| 3:39:51| This is confusing. Even I myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13191)|
| 3:39:53| get turned around, so I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13193)|
| 3:39:55| everybody understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13195)|
| 3:39:57| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| Yeah, final comments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13199)|
| 3:40:01| We did meet with Mr. Sanderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13201)|
| 3:40:03| this morning, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13203)|
| 3:40:05| correct me if I'm wrong, because I do not want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13205)|
| 3:40:07| misquote anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13207)|
| 3:40:09| The back homes were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| be 2 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13211)|
| 3:40:13| The front's going to be 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| Did I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13215)|
| 3:40:17| When we were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13217)|
| 3:40:19| oh my gosh, nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13219)|
| 3:40:21| knows what the numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13221)|
| 3:40:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13223)|
| 3:40:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13225)|
| 3:40:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| Seeing no further lights on, I'm going to look to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13229)|
| 3:40:31| 6th District Commissioner for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13231)|
| 3:40:33| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| use your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13235)|
| 3:40:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13237)|
| 3:40:39| Before I make a motion, I actually do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13239)|
| 3:40:41| have some questions. I was waiting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| everyone else to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13243)|
| 3:40:45| ask theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| Mr. Stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| the infamous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13249)|
| 3:40:51| intersection that we've all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13251)|
| 3:40:53| been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13253)|
| 3:40:55| I was thinking at one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13255)|
| 3:40:57| that you had told me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| you tried to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13259)|
| 3:41:01| some of that property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13261)|
| 3:41:03| that Smithville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13263)|
| 3:41:05| is talking, the second piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13265)|
| 3:41:07| that's right there in the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13267)|
| 3:41:09| and that you actually would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13269)|
| 3:41:11| using a chunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13271)|
| 3:41:13| of that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13273)|
| 3:41:15| reconfigure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13275)|
| 3:41:17| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13277)|
| 3:41:19| again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13279)|
| 3:41:21| the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| and Josh, I had to beat you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13283)|
| 3:41:25| about this because you did the good thing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13285)|
| 3:41:27| try to give people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| an idea of what was going on, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| that, I mean, the homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13291)|
| 3:41:33| the backyards of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13293)|
| 3:41:35| homes on that corner would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| be right where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13297)|
| 3:41:39| improvement would need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13299)|

| 3:41:43| I mean, for the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| Our concept doesn't show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| the dedication we have to give up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| Knox County, so there would be a buffer and whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13309)|
| 3:41:51| else we need there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13311)|
| 3:41:55| So the picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13315)|
| 3:41:57| just to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13317)|
| 3:41:59| sure, the picture that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13319)|
| 3:42:01| sent us in the email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13321)|
| 3:42:07| on parcel two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13327)|
| 3:42:09| if you look to the far upper right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| that corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| part of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13333)|
| 3:42:15| actually not going to be a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13335)|
| 3:42:17| It's going to be right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13337)|
| 3:42:29| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13349)|
| 3:42:31| the very border of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13351)|
| 3:42:33| orange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13353)|
| 3:42:35| does show it going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13355)|
| 3:42:37| to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13357)|
| 3:42:39| what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| the, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| either the asphalt level or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| right of way. I'm not sure on this concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13365)|
| 3:42:47| to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13367)|
| 3:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13371)|
| 3:42:53| But it would obviously adhere to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13373)|
| 3:42:55| 35-foot peripheral setback that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13375)|
| 3:42:57| Knox County sets on all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13377)|
| 3:42:59| PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13379)|
| 3:43:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13381)|
| 3:43:03| You see what I'm asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13383)|
| 3:43:05| Jim, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13385)|
| 3:43:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13388)|
| 3:43:10| I was looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13390)|
| 3:43:12| major road plan for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13392)|
| 3:43:14| that dictates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13394)|
| 3:43:16| the right of way dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13396)|
| 3:43:18| And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13398)|
| 3:43:20| actually, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13400)|
| 3:43:22| the Beaver Ridge Road at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13402)|
| 3:43:24| is a major collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13404)|
| 3:43:26| and its required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13406)|
| 3:43:28| right of way dedication would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13408)|
| 3:43:30| 30 feet off center, a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| of 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13412)|
| 3:43:34| So we'd be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13414)|
| 3:43:36| at, like I said, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| three 11-foot lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13418)|
| 3:43:40| with probably a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13420)|
| 3:43:42| So that's 33| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13422)|
| 3:43:44| plus 1343| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13424)|
| 3:43:46| divided by 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13426)|
| 3:43:48| Doing this math in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13428)|
| 3:43:50| it's kind of dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13430)|
| 3:43:52| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13434)|
| 3:43:56| based on that we could contain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| another lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13438)|
| 3:44:00| or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13440)|
| 3:44:02| portion of a lane as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13442)|
| 3:44:04| a pedestrian facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13444)|
| 3:44:06| within the required dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13446)|
| 3:44:08| that the major road plan would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13448)|
| 3:44:10| dictate to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13450)|
| 3:44:12| Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13452)|
| 3:44:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13454)|
| 3:44:16| Is it fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13456)|
| 3:44:18| to say that sometimes it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13458)|
| 3:44:20| easier to take a risk on a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13460)|
| 3:44:22| of property when you get the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13462)|
| 3:44:24| at such a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13464)|
| 3:44:26| price that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13466)|
| 3:44:28| there's not a huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13468)|
| 3:44:30| chunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13470)|
| 3:44:32| of money at front so you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13472)|
| 3:44:34| I'm going to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13474)|
| 3:44:36| I kind of got in trouble with this because this already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13476)|
| 3:44:38| appeared, this 19 acres appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13478)|
| 3:44:40| before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13480)|
| 3:44:42| with a different developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13482)|
| 3:44:44| Right, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13484)|
| 3:44:46| I assumed it went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13486)|
| 3:44:48| already came through county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13488)|
| 3:44:50| to be completely honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13490)|
| 3:44:52| You thought it what? I thought it already came through county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13492)|
| 3:44:54| to be actually rezoned and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13494)|
| 3:44:56| wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13496)|
| 3:44:58| No, it was withdrawn from the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13498)|
| 3:45:00| Yeah, I know it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13500)|
| 3:45:02| So we moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13502)|
| 3:45:04| forward with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13504)|
| 3:45:06| thinking that that part was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13506)|
| 3:45:08| a done deal. And went ahead and engineered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13508)|
| 3:45:10| it and then purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13510)|
| 3:45:12| the other property and moved forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13512)|
| 3:45:14| with it. Yeah, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13514)|
| 3:45:16| the truth of the matter is the prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13516)|
| 3:45:18| developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13518)|
| 3:45:20| that had it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13520)|
| 3:45:22| did a turnabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13522)|
| 3:45:24| Yeah, but not for flooding reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13524)|
| 3:45:26| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13526)|
| 3:45:28| he's not here so I can't ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13528)|
| 3:45:30| But I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13530)|
| 3:45:32| think that may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13532)|
| 3:45:34| a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| Having said all that though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13536)|
| 3:45:38| I've got to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13538)|
| 3:45:40| I was so impressed of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13540)|
| 3:45:42| Josh, that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13542)|
| 3:45:44| handled yourself representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13544)|
| 3:45:46| Smithville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13546)|
| 3:45:48| the neighbors. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13548)|
| 3:45:50| Miss Absher, my goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13550)|
| 3:45:52| she is, she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13552)|
| 3:45:54| got this up and running and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13554)|
| 3:45:56| going and pulled in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13556)|
| 3:45:58| you know, the neighbors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13558)|
| 3:46:00| the community just in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13560)|
| 3:46:02| really remarkable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13562)|
| 3:46:04| And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13564)|
| 3:46:06| do, really kind of repeating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13566)|
| 3:46:08| what Josh said, I just, I commend everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13568)|
| 3:46:10| for that because it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13570)|
| 3:46:12| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13572)|
| 3:46:14| civil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13574)|
| 3:46:16| to put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13576)|
| 3:46:18| properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13578)|
| 3:46:20| I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13580)|
| 3:46:22| know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13582)|
| 3:46:24| the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13584)|
| 3:46:26| has suggested a concession or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13586)|
| 3:46:28| and I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13588)|
| 3:46:30| the business side that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13590)|
| 3:46:32| you don't feel like you can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13592)|
| 3:46:34| with less density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13594)|
| 3:46:38| I've got to tell you, Josh, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13598)|
| 3:46:40| think this is a horrible piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13600)|

| 3:52:01| more appropriate on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13921)|
| 3:52:03| the buildable acreage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13923)|
| 3:52:05| If I'm correct, I think Ms. Brooks had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13925)|
| 3:52:07| some sort of explanation and might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13927)|
| 3:52:09| shed some light on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13929)|
| 3:52:11| It would be on the total property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13931)|
| 3:52:13| FEMA and Knox County's own regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13933)|
| 3:52:15| would restrict the development to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13935)|
| 3:52:17| 11.08, approximately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13937)|
| 3:52:19| that acreage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13939)|
| 3:52:21| They would only be allowed to build on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13941)|
| 3:52:23| those acres. But the motion is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13943)|
| 3:52:25| the entire property at 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13945)|
| 3:52:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13948)|
| 3:52:30| If I make the motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13950)|
| 3:52:32| approve three per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13952)|

| 3:52:39| I'm sorry, on this roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13959)|
| 3:52:41| 20 acres, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13961)|
| 3:52:43| basically making a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13963)|
| 3:52:45| I know you're not doing this, Josh, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13965)|

| 3:52:51| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13971)|
| 3:52:53| it could, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13973)|
| 3:52:55| though I totally believe what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13975)|
| 3:52:57| about what you plan to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13977)|
| 3:52:59| Like I said, I wish everyone had to swear in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13979)|
| 3:53:01| up here. That's what we swear to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13981)|
| 3:53:03| I know that, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13983)|
| 3:53:05| I know. But I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13985)|
| 3:53:07| I need to be appropriate in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13987)|

| 3:53:13| Did you have a follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13993)|
| 3:53:15| If I make a motion of three per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13995)|
| 3:53:17| then it's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13997)|
| 3:53:19| approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=13999)|
| 3:53:21| this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14001)|

| 3:53:25| No, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14005)|
| 3:53:27| I believe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14007)|
| 3:53:29| restrictions are that 11.8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14009)|
| 3:53:31| is the only ones that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14011)|
| 3:53:33| be built upon, so they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14013)|
| 3:53:35| restricted anyway by size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14015)|
| 3:53:37| There's no way they could put 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14019)|
| 3:53:41| Well, yeah, you could put five per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14021)|
| 3:53:43| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14023)|
| 3:53:45| buildable land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14025)|
| 3:53:47| No, if you approve it at three, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14027)|
| 3:53:49| three per the buildable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14029)|
| 3:53:51| area. So it would be approximately, if they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14031)|
| 3:53:53| got three, it would be approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14033)|
| 3:53:55| 33. Okay, you're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14035)|
| 3:53:57| hearing that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14037)|
| 3:53:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14039)|
| 3:54:03| I cannot support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14043)|
| 3:54:05| I'm sorry, Josh. I'm making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14045)|
| 3:54:07| the motion because I want it to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14047)|
| 3:54:09| and I want to have the vote of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14049)|
| 3:54:11| So I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14051)|
| 3:54:13| put on the floor that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14053)|
| 3:54:15| is approved at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14055)|

| 3:56:21| I want to say one quick thing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14181)|
| 3:56:23| In the last two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14183)|
| 3:56:25| years, I think we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14185)|
| 3:56:27| had this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14187)|
| 3:56:29| many, many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14189)|
| 3:56:31| about the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14191)|
| 3:56:33| I was actually pretty astonished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14193)|
| 3:56:35| to hear from Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14195)|
| 3:56:37| that there's a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14197)|
| 3:56:39| in place and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14199)|
| 3:56:41| price tag of that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14201)|
| 3:56:43| and the idea that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14203)|
| 3:56:45| we could ask TDOT to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14207)|
| 3:56:49| When I last heard of big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14209)|
| 3:56:51| road improvements, I thought of millions and millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14211)|
| 3:56:53| and millions of dollars, and that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14213)|
| 3:56:55| We're talking about approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=14215)|

| 4:11:21| where we'll make big decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15081)|
| 4:11:23| that will affect where we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15083)|
| 4:11:25| from here and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15085)|
| 4:11:27| for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15087)|
| 4:11:29| I don't expect to change anyone's mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15089)|
| 4:11:31| tonight, but I just wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15091)|
| 4:11:33| a few words and explain why I'm going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15093)|
| 4:11:35| against this ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15095)|
| 4:11:37| First off, I want to thank the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15097)|
| 4:11:39| of the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15099)|
| 4:11:41| These are community volunteers who've dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15101)|
| 4:11:43| a lot of their time and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15103)|
| 4:11:45| been treated fairly poorly during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15105)|
| 4:11:47| the last year. I've spent time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15107)|
| 4:11:49| with many of them. I know firsthand their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15109)|
| 4:11:51| good intentions and focus have always been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15111)|
| 4:11:53| serving the public with their education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15113)|
| 4:11:55| and professional experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15115)|
| 4:11:57| And to the members of the public who have had this terrible virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15117)|
| 4:11:59| and may still be suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15119)|
| 4:12:01| so many I have spoken with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15121)|
| 4:12:03| I really hope you heal soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15123)|
| 4:12:05| More than 600| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15125)|
| 4:12:07| plus families in Knox County have lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15127)|
| 4:12:09| a loved one to COVID. Just please know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15129)|
| 4:12:11| that there are people in your leadership who are listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15131)|
| 4:12:13| to you. We'll never know your pain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15133)|
| 4:12:15| but we do want you to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15135)|
| 4:12:17| that your voice is not lost in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15137)|
| 4:12:19| I've always maintained that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15139)|
| 4:12:21| Board of Health is a part of our public health infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15141)|
| 4:12:23| that is important. The Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15143)|
| 4:12:25| is a product of the state, created by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15145)|
| 4:12:27| state of Tennessee and adopted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15147)|
| 4:12:29| this legislative body well before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15149)|
| 4:12:31| any of us were serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15151)|
| 4:12:33| I've maintained from the beginning if the state wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15153)|
| 4:12:35| change the form and the function of the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15155)|
| 4:12:37| of Health, we will abide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15157)|
| 4:12:39| Yet still it has not. I continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15159)|
| 4:12:41| to question, based on the clearly written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15161)|
| 4:12:43| state law, if Commission has the authority to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15163)|
| 4:12:45| an advisory Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15165)|
| 4:12:47| but I'll just have to simply disagree with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15167)|
| 4:12:49| law department on the interpretation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15169)|
| 4:12:51| move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15171)|
| 4:12:53| There's pending state litigation to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15173)|
| 4:12:55| the powers of the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15175)|
| 4:12:57| but I'm hearing directly from sources in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15177)|
| 4:12:59| Capitol that this legislation is in trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15179)|
| 4:13:01| that more amendments are certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15181)|
| 4:13:03| to occur, and perhaps the entire thing might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15183)|
| 4:13:05| be even shelved. But yet, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15185)|
| 4:13:07| don't want to wait and see what happens on a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15187)|
| 4:13:09| level, even for a month or two, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15189)|
| 4:13:11| still am not exactly sure why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15191)|
| 4:13:13| We're still under a state public health emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15193)|
| 4:13:15| set by our governor until at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15195)|
| 4:13:17| April 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15197)|
| 4:13:19| But here we are tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15199)|
| 4:13:21| Tonight's proposed ordinance change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15201)|
| 4:13:23| is the second in a series of orchestrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15203)|
| 4:13:25| actions I outlined earlier this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15205)|
| 4:13:27| Step one, create an unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15207)|
| 4:13:29| committee on economic health and well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15209)|
| 4:13:31| to establish a shadow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15211)|
| 4:13:33| Board of Health, a committee with no direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15213)|
| 4:13:35| filled with its members who continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15215)|
| 4:13:37| question what they're supposed to do and why they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15217)|
| 4:13:39| That's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15219)|
| 4:13:41| Step two, dissolve the Board of Health, which is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15221)|
| 4:13:43| the passing of tonight's ordinance will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| And step three, place the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15225)|
| 4:13:47| entire decision-making burden on our public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15227)|
| 4:13:49| health officer, Dr. Martha Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15229)|
| 4:13:51| Then, I think what you'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15231)|
| 4:13:53| is efforts to discredit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15233)|
| 4:13:55| her, either force her to resign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15235)|
| 4:13:57| under immense political or public pressure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15237)|
| 4:13:59| or perhaps even restructure the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15239)|
| 4:14:01| and demote her by putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15241)|
| 4:14:03| an administrator above her. I hope that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15243)|
| 4:14:05| happen, and I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15245)|
| 4:14:07| you do not leave us, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15247)|
| 4:14:09| I've heard many of my colleagues say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15249)|
| 4:14:11| they're listening to their constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15251)|
| 4:14:13| but if that was the case, then I think you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15253)|
| 4:14:15| have overwhelmingly heard from citizens who don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15255)|
| 4:14:17| want the Board of Health to be dissolved. You would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15257)|
| 4:14:19| have heard from almost 100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15259)|
| 4:14:21| seniors in our community who want medical professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15261)|
| 4:14:23| to guide public health, not politicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15263)|
| 4:14:25| With all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15265)|
| 4:14:27| what I really worry about is what's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15267)|
| 4:14:29| Just this afternoon, a respected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15269)|
| 4:14:31| member of the Board of Health sent a letter stating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15271)|
| 4:14:33| if the Board was dissolved, he will no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15273)|
| 4:14:35| serve, and I wonder how many more will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15275)|
| 4:14:37| resign thereafter. Then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15277)|
| 4:14:39| I also wonder what will happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15279)|
| 4:14:41| if there's another viral epidemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15281)|
| 4:14:43| a tuberculosis outbreak, or, God forbid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15283)|
| 4:14:45| something worse. Then how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15285)|
| 4:14:47| will we react? Will we trust our public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15287)|
| 4:14:49| health experts, or will we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15289)|
| 4:14:51| second-guess their every decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15291)|
| 4:14:53| I've been vaccinated now, and I encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15293)|
| 4:14:55| everyone to get their vaccination as soon as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15295)|
| 4:14:57| possible from whatever source is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15297)|
| 4:14:59| And while it's encouraging to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15299)|
| 4:15:01| vaccinations are up and cases down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15301)|
| 4:15:03| I don't believe the forest fire has yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15303)|
| 4:15:05| been fully extinguished. There are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15305)|
| 4:15:07| hot embers, and as a former Boy Scout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15307)|
| 4:15:09| I know you never leave a hot fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15309)|
| 4:15:11| unattended and simply walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15311)|
| 4:15:13| So, thanks for the time to say my piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15313)|
| 4:15:15| I appreciate your attention, and I urge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15315)|

| 4:15:21| Is there any further discussion on Item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15321)|
| 4:15:23| Number 43?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15323)|
| 4:15:25| Seeing none, Madam Clerk, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15325)|
| 4:15:27| please call a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15327)|
| 4:15:29| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15329)|
| 4:15:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=15331)|
