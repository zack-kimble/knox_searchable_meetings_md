| 0:00:39| Nathaniel Sheltov| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=39)|

| 0:00:57| I'm excited to have joined the Planning Commission here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| Lived in Knoxville since 2007 graduated from UT. I'm a relationship manager with First Bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=62)|
| 0:01:09| Involved with some community organizations the East Tennessee Community Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| the East Tennessee Foundation and two bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| just always been a sort of hobbyist follower of planning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| Watching our community grow. So, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=84)|
| 0:01:34| Certainly a couple housekeeping. I think I mentioned that we'll have drinks arrive shortly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| I apologize for that delay and that and the food also I've asked PBA to turn up or turn down the air conditioner at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=99)|
| 0:01:46| Not sure if they had control over the heat right now, but hopefully it'll get a little warmer here in a couple minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| Just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| A few announcements. I want to update to you on a couple things that staff have been working on. I've mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| These a couple times over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| Several months, but both the city and county redistricting plans are complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| City Council approved last Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| Their plan with very little discussion or fanfare and that was because there were no changes that were required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:16| Or needed for the district boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| Even though the city of Knoxville the growth has been significant in the past 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| Gaining nearly 12,000 new residents that growth has been evenly distributed around the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| So keeping equal population sizes in all council districts, so there was no need to adjust those boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| The County Commission plan on the other hand demanded a lot more attention from our planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| Which provided mapping scenario assistance to several commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| And in the end the the plan that was devised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| By Commissioner Kyle Ward was the one that was deemed the most acceptable by the majority of the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| Sorry County Commissioners, and it passed two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| at a special called meeting of County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| The challenges to that plan included putting together a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| Plan that included preservation of a majority minority district and minimizing the number of people that would be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| So keeping the established communities intact and keeping incumbents in their current districts were some of the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| The adopted plan was a compromise and as not all district boundaries were able to accommodate all those goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| So the next step for our staff is to work with the Election Commission and its administrator to make adjustments to local voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| Precincts a regular outcome that is necessitated by the redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| and population change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| So we'll be working on that over the next month or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| The Knox County enrollment project model is currently underway. We do this every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| So our GIS staff is is deep into that annual update to the Knox County schools enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| projections and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Their work includes five key model inputs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| Geocoded student addresses approximately 60,000 an inventory of subdivision lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| Calculation of student yield that's the number of student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| School the school children generated by new development. This is also included in the planning staff reports that you all are familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| mobility how students move into and out of a zone and birth projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| And we build those data sets on behalf of the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| And then we deliver it to them and their staff run their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Models that they use for their own projections and what I've asked our GIS staff is if they could come and present to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| Give you a more in-depth description of the work that goes into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| As well as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Reminder of what we use to help inform those projections that are included in each of your staff reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| Especially they're related to the plan residential zones. So they'll do that either in December or January of this year. It's a agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=288)|
| 0:04:57| County Commission approved the contract with Kimley Horne and associates for the development of Knox County's comprehensive lane use and transportation plan recently and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=297)|
| 0:05:05| Contract was actually officially executed on November 5th. So we're really excited about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| so the next two months will involve a lot of data gathering and orientation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| by both a planning staff County staff the consultant team and our graphics web and communication staff will be ramping up their efforts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=315)|
| 0:05:23| develop a website and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| Help Knox County with a communication outreach strategy for the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| We have intentionally scheduled the consultant team provides you all with your first project update at the January 11th agenda review meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| so we're really looking forward to you all meeting them and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| I'm getting this project kicked off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| With that that's all I have any questions comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| Yes, and as you probably have seen there is drinks now available if you want to get up and grab one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=352)|
| 0:06:00| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Want to take a pause let's take a pause if you want to get something to drink, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| The first item on our list is number 19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| This is HL container LLC staff is recommending denial this request and I'll turn it over to Liz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| This property is approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| 4.51 acres in size. It's in the North Hill Spring Hill neighborhood area. It is off of Buffett Mill Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=381)|
| 0:06:30| Just south and it is at the end of Fountain Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| Boulevard on this map here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| you can see that it's not within the parental responsibility zone of any of the schools in that area and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| Sidewalks are not present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| The applicant is asking to go from RN 1 to RN 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| This property is approximately three-tenths of a mile from the cap bus stop on Buffett Mill Road to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=413)|
| 0:07:01| However sidewalks are not present to connect to that bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| And although this property has two frontages access to the property is limited to the Fountain Park Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| frontage the access off Buffett Mill Road is too steep and too narrow and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| Even the Fountain Park Boulevard has some site concerns and there are no sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| This property is surrounded by RN 1 zoning with some HP overlay zoning as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:33| The rezoning to RN 2 could permit much narrower and smaller lots in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| In fact when we look at area lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| they're actually larger than the RN 1 minimums in this area currently they range from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| 22,000 square feet to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| 27,400 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Average lot widths in this area are also larger than the existing RN 1 minimums. For example in the southeast corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=476)|
| 0:08:04| There are lots with 75 foot lot widths. I'll turn on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| pointer so you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| So here's an example of a lot width that is 75 feet. Can you see that? Yeah, let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=492)|
| 0:08:20| There we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| most of the lots around this tract are more in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| 100 foot width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| This shows the difference between the RN 1 zoning and the RN 2 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| Just to reiterate the lot size that is allowed by the existing RN 1 zoning is actually smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| Than what is in the surrounding area? So more density could be accommodated without changing the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| Single family lots in the RN 1 are allowed to be as small as 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| Whereas the RN 2 would take them down to 5,000 square feet potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| both the RN 1 and RN 2 permit duplexes but as a special use and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| the minimum lot widths between RN 1 and RN 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| The RN 1 is 75 feet and the RN 2 is 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Staff's recommendation is to deny the RN 2 because the dimensional standards are not compatible with the existing development in the surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=559)|
| 0:09:29| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:40| So there is a 5,000 square foot difference between the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| So couldn't really say number of houses necessarily because the lot widths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| I think would be more challenging probably than the minimum lot size here 75 feet versus 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=589)|
| 0:09:58| But the surrounding lot widths are currently around 100 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=598)|
| 0:10:06| So under RN 1 we don't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Look at density per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| It's you know, they could build anything from 10,000 square foot lots up to 20,000 square foot lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| The minimum is 10,000 though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| But their goal is to put those small container homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| so we don't really know for sure they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Don't at the time of rezoning have to specify what their type of use is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| We just know that they want the RN 2 zoning which would allow the smaller lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| Right, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| HL container one LLC. I think they are I think these are finite size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| Pre-built homes. Okay that they're they're wanting to put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=647)|

| 0:10:59| is this actually subsidized affordable housing or is she just saying it's affordable because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| The cost point so so we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| Look at the price point at the time of rezoning at all or really any time in our review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| So, you know, we we don't really know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| What they'll put the applicant can say what they want to put but I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| They could get the RN 2 zoning and turn around and sell it and someone else could have a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| You know price point that they're looking at so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Know we had some discussion with recode about the manufactured homes. Is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| this a qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=704)|

| 0:11:51| We haven't looked into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| You know as Liz said in terms of the the type of construction that they'll actually end up that would that would fall under the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| Purview, but it wouldn't fall under like what you're thinking about at the sink a single wide. Is that what you're thinking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| Not so much, but I know there was like some prefab homes that were allowed in the city under recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| That doesn't ring a bell to me Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| But I think what would kick in is the building code and whether or not what they wanted to build would comply with the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=742)|

| 0:12:29| All right, thank you Liz so item number six is 11 a 21 SC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:38| This is a request to close Glenmore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| This was denied by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| But it was appealed by the applicant to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| the appeal was withdrawn at Council after an agreement was reached to allow the closure to proceed with the city retaining a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| public access agreement for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=773)|

| 0:12:58| so that's that's one reason you're seeing it now and now the city has has taken over the application is that they're wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| to close this to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| To maintain that access into the park for the neighborhood and other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| I'll turn over to Michelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| It's not connecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Mm-hmm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=794)|
| 0:13:24| Okay, so that was pretty much everything I was gonna say about this one just to kind of remind you that it came through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| Few months ago. Um, that was for enclosure of Glenmore Drive in its entirety now. It's just the back half of Glenmore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=809)|
| 0:13:38| Can you actually restate I was listening but when I saw this case come through I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| Recognized it remembered but was still confused as to what was different than before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| Sure, so I'm gonna cover that. So the previous closure was from actual Bennington Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| Where that connected actually, let me get out of slideshow so you can see my cursor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| So it was the original closure was from Bennington Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| Okay, oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| Didn't have to come back to us if City Council decided they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| They wanted engineering to work with the applicant on to see whether or not they could create some sort of pedestrian access that would meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| engineering's requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Did you guys recommend closure last time? I don't remember we did recommend closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| this is the one if you guys recall that the pool was built within the sector the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| Setback area the fence was too high and within the right-of-way. And so we were basing our closure on some of those factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| It really just because we'd heard so much from the neighbors and wanting that pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| and so now engineering has been working with them and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| You know agreed to the closure with the condition that's in the staff report that that it be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| along with that language and the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| And so that's why it's before you now and now it's just a partial closure. So it starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| basically right after the driveway sets bill on tickling more so they can still be serviced by a public right-of-way and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| This parts closed here and then an easement would be along this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| So you can still walk from the neighborhood into the park through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| That will be a condition of the approval as engineering is still work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| We don't actually have plans or the easement or anything like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| But that will be up to engineering at the time of never everything comes through to them to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| When it comes to for permitting I guess for the easement the plot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| so if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| closure takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| The intention is that humans would still be able to walk through there. That is correct. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| Michelle why wouldn't we close the entire street in this reserve of 25 foot easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:08| I'm sorry. Can you why would we close? I didn't hear what was after that. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Why are we just closing part of it and not the whole thing and then reserving a 25-foot easement from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=973)|
| 0:16:22| Park yeah, we didn't actually have a say so like in their creation of the application. This is what was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| So I guess engineering could speak to why they put the line where they put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| I know that they just wanted to keep the driveways on to where the they had access to the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| But why it's placed right there. I could not say okay, so driveways do come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| Yes, this is the boundary here both driveways are still on the open part of one more drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1005)|
| 0:16:56| Any other questions on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Okay, the next one is 11 D 21 SC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| This is a right-of-way closure associated with the mixed-use stadium project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| Sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1027)|
| 0:17:07| So this one is coming to you because the creek is depicted on the maps a little bit differently from how right away is normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| depicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| You can see here in the standard map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| It's kind of shown within a right-of-way and the same thing with a cityward map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| But when you look at other creeks and how they're depicted in KGIS, it's literally just to the creek bed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| That's shown on both the cityward map and the standard map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| So because of this right-of-way enclosure on engineering felt it best path forward to making sure that land could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| Designated to the surrounding property owners was to close it as a typical right away. So that's why you guys are seeing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| Just to give you context. It's just the kind of part. This is part of first Creek that is still has existing vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| South of Willow Drive, so they're requesting it right where it meets Willow Drive to a point that is in the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| 448 feet in length and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| The city's engineering department worked with a private title company and confirmed or they could not find any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:11| Ownership information so no no one seems to own those that part of the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| Also, we found that the city of Knoxville made major improvements to first Creek in 1958| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| They rerouted the stream and provided a closed conduit where the expressway crosses Willow Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| And that's in the downtown the Knoxville downtown loop document the hydrologic feature section on 17 and 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| Which is one of the exhibits in your packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| And so with that research considered and the fact that the areas indexed on the cityward map as a right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| engineering has submitted an application for closure to abandon the area enabled the city to issue a quick claim deed to private ownership for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| plan development and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Similar to other utility rest easement at reservations typical to other right-of-way closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| The city will reserve an easement for the water flowage of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| I have a question about this road closure, and there are a couple of others that are road closures for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| The anticipation of the multi-use stadium. Mm-hmm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| If for some reason the multi-use stadium was not to happen what happens to roads that have been closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| because of the anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| new project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Well, if they've if they've already been closed, they wouldn't be able to be reopened but there is a condition in the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| That's provided that talks about it becoming null and void of certain conditions aren't met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| So provided those conditions are met that it would be closed if they are not then it would revert back to the way that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| Is now let's go ask. Mr. McKinley to come up. He's with city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| The the right-of-way closures that are before you are conditional so they would have to meet the certain conditions like she said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| Those conditions are substantial completion of the stadium. So if the stadium is not built then it would just revert back to the way it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| Like the zoning goes zoning goes back to as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Doesn't it something more to happen the baseball stadium not going through didn't the city agree to rezone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Put it back to the zone. It was previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Well, the underlying zoning doesn't go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| Because it is that planned overlay if that doesn't get built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| Then someone else could come in with a different plan all together and just build to the standards of the underlying zoning code. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1224)|
| 0:20:33| Actually have another question that is regarding the I think it's six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| Can I ask that at the end of our meeting or is it better to go back right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| You can ask it now since Michelle has she's hooked up to the computer. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1245)|

| 0:20:57| Doesn't that mean that for the automobile traffic won't it start to collect near those driveways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1257)|

| 0:21:21| Because Glenmore Drive is still open. Are you guys leaving it open for public access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Are you is there any sort of restriction on vehicular access there to the best of my knowledge? It's not for vehicular access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| It's just for the pedestrian access and then the driveways for the units that it's serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1292)|

| 0:22:02| So I'm sure you all are familiar with where this is located due to the public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| You've probably already looked at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| It is at the end of Anderson Drive, which is south of Kingston Pike and Dean Hill near where these two roadways meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| It would be accessed from those roads by either Henry Child Street or South Weiss Garber Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| Another option is to come up north on South North Shore take will to place to South Garber to end up on Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| Anderson Drive itself is 26 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1348)|

| 0:22:55| So there is a pretty broad mix of commercial office and warehousing in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| and looking at the site plan again that access is off of Anderson the actual car wash facility is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| Located in the south along the south property line in the far corner of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| Vehicles enter from either side and can approach the building from either side. There's wash tunnels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| And that's where the exterior and interior washing of the cars occurs with the exception of vacuuming which is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| Facility is planned to have 39 employees 40 parking spaces are provided and that is in compliance with the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:34| Because the site is adjacent to commercial and I'm sorry civic institutional use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| It's got a type B buffer that's required along the northern and eastern property lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1419)|

| 0:23:48| Talking about the challenges of this site you guys have heard a lot of this from the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| But just to kind of give you a lay of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| The church has three parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| This one south of Anderson Drive people can park and cross to get to the church or the daycare facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1437)|

| 0:24:05| parking lot across Henry Childs same that would require crossing of this street and then there is the option of this parking lot to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| North which has 23 regular parking spaces and 10 handicapped spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| With a direct entry into the church facility where people could access the daycare that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| There is a drop-off and pickup site. It's approximately 90 feet long which should accommodate up to four cars at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| And then the car wash site again is down here down Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| And then here's just those street measurements and then for more context some bird's-eye view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| Of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| And getting into the street views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| Anderson Drive, here's that pull-off area. So there is a covered area. So if it's raining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| The car wash probably wouldn't be very busy if it's even open so people would be able to access this without any traffic conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| This is you we can't couldn't get any closer into the site on Google Street views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| That's kind of an image taken from there. And so again, just kind of talking about the challenges of the site. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| That church next door does have a daycare and after-school program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| The daycare has children ages 6 weeks to 5 years the after-school program children ages 5 to 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| It's presumed that children would be escorted by adults at all times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Whether it's or like a quick recess or whether that is to get to and from the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| The daycare and car wash are anticipated to have different peak times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| The peak times for the daycare and after care programs would be at the drop-off and pickup times which occur from 830 to 9 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| The morning and from 2 to 4 p.m. In the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Harper auto car car wash anticipates their peak hours based on existing facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| They have operating today as between 11 and 2 their busiest days being Friday and Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| Or Saturday, there would be no daycare and after-school care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| The car wash is closed on Sundays. There are no anticipated. Well, there would be no traffic conflicts then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Kind of summarizes it. I'm sure you all have questions for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Where does Anderson Drive stop? What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| Yeah, technically it stops at this property line, although it under the street view it appears to continue on into this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1582)|
| 0:26:30| It does go into that parking lot area it doesn't no it doesn't it looks like it does and the images but the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| Closure there are end of the right-of-way itself is at this blue line. All right where the gate is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| On Anderson, is that the end of the problem or of the public street? It's it's very close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1604)|
| 0:26:52| I want to say that this right here is the gate. Yeah, okay, but they do leave it open now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| The point they do leave the gate open now, it wasn't open when Google was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| I think as a part of this process they learned that was not the property but they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Close the gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| No, because it's a public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| For one and for two the gate appears to be and in this parcel the car wash parcel. It's not owned by the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| I think the gate was installed before. Well, the church could build a gate then is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| Well, no because Anderson Drive is a public right-of-way you can't close off or a gate a public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| but you said Anderson Drive doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| continue on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| So Anderson Drive continues all along here. This property is owned by the car wash folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| Okay, and so that the church's gate isn't on the church's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| So they would not be able to close it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| Legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| All right, but but you say well let's go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1677)|
| 0:28:19| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| So this blue shaded area is the car wash property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| It's hard to tell where the gate is this this might be it right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Yeah, regardless, even if it's not on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| It's still within a public right-of-way and the gate could not be legally closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| I think the church installed the gate and closed it when they were under the assumption that it was their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| I don't think it was ever their intention to close a public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| But now they're aware of that and they've been so they can't block the street off that's correct. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| And then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=1739)|

| 0:36:39| But as you come through and you if you were to go to the drop-off on the under you would have to turn left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Well once you're in there you have to do a ue right leave it or do you turn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| You can turn right to come off of Anderson and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| But you're going off what I mean is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| That will be no longer able to be utilized or can will they be able to go off that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| Still go off that way can you show where that comes out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| Do then they go through the parking lot to the right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Are you asking where Anderson comes? Yes, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| So Anderson terminates right here, so if they did come on to this property that would have to be you know private agreement between the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| And the car wash as to whether or not they that's where I was getting it Anderson does terminate there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| But there's a parking lot to the west of the church that has a drive-by is that not correct that is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| So they could get out to Dean Hill from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| And they do now, but that's that's technically not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| That's technically private property after Anderson until the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| I mean they could when they they could have it platted to perform to provide an access easement along through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| But again that would be something private between both property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| But if I owned a business to I would close off my business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Probably to not allow people just to make it a drive-thru so that's entirely possible that Harper could do that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2285)|
| 0:38:20| Let's look at that a little more closely so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| If they did that how would they have access to their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Which party the car wash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2308)|

| 0:38:36| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Think the the usage hours that you shared was an important factor to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:49| In terms of how the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| Groups use their property or anticipated being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| Yeah, I think so too. I don't think our washes are typically busy at the I think the peak time would be more the drop-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| I think the pickup would probably be a little bit more dispersed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| Either they do have the aftercare which is kids that are five to twelve which could feasibly use the pull-off provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| There was an opportunity to turn around the daycares up to five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Kids would probably still be escorted by their parents into the building unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| They do like some schools and have a school representative there to meet the kids and take the kids into the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Which would speed up the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| But that would be up to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Yeah, I was gonna say there are lots of different models for how child pickup drop-off happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| Based upon age all the things you were mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| strollers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Car seats etc. And there are lots of schools in the area that have come up with incredibly efficient ways to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2384)|

| 0:41:41| So the applicant is proposing to replant their property and this sort of configuration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| Which would separate the two uses all the residential use would be along this part of the property and all the market garden use along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| This with a shared driveway between the two uses all of the parking for the market garden would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| Right in this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| It is in compliance with what would be required by the ordinance and by Knox engineer Knox count sorry city of Knoxville engineering staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2519)|
| 0:42:08| There is three building here buildings here are accessory buildings associated with the market garden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| They're currently using the garage as a flower studio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| This is a tool shed and this is sort of supplies and a different shed to serve the larger garden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| And this is to be a high tunnel, which is a greenhouse essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| so that's what they're proposing to do is to to add that one and then divide the property and in this way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| Basically we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Supporting this and recommending approval just based on the fact that it is somewhat close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| Tazewell Pike so we don't anticipate a great deal of traffic coming through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| You know all of Villa Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| it would just be coming mostly from Tazewell Pike and we feel like because it's the market garden is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| Allowed in our in one zone as a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| It would meet zoning ordinance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| It does meet the requirements of greenhouse or a high tunnel in terms of building height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| And then it meets all the the other requirements within the special use application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:14| What is a market garden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| So that is someone who is selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Their garden products whether it's flowers or vegetables for to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2599)|

| 0:43:28| I don't know if they pick the vegetables for the person or if the person goes on to the site and picks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| But they buy directly from from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2612)|
| 0:43:44| Michelle when the property is subdivided will the property have access to a public road or frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2624)|
| 0:43:52| It will have a shared driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Through here and at that it'll be platted that way the access so under the city regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| You don't need public road frontage for a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| You can have one property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Access through another property with an access easement only so because the house has its own frontage on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| the back property has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| An access easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2660)|
| 0:44:29| See no more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| We'll move on to item number 37, which is 11 a 21 PD. This is the the final plan request for the mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2671)|
| 0:44:40| Stadium project. I'm just going to lead off here and then turn it over to Michelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| I just want to again since this is really this is only the second one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| You've seen in the final plan stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| And just remind you what staff and Planning Commission responsibilities are and the review of this this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| So per the zoning code staff and the Commission have very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| responsibilities staff must review the final plan to ensure it is in substantial compliance with the approved preliminary plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| recommend approval or denial to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| planning and city staff have been working closely with applicant over the last 30 days to ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| The plan that is submitted will result in a development that is in substantial compliance with the approved plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| And now the Planning Commission upon recommendation of the planning staff must review the final plan either approve or deny the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2721)|
| 0:45:29| Now Michelle is going to walk you through the key elements of the final plan and staffs recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| So article sixteen point seven point F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Modifications to approved final plans. Um, this is just saying that no adjustments could be made to the approved final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| So once it's approved it's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Unless they apply to the city in accordance with the zoning ordinance and that's referring to the minor and the major modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| So if it's a minor modification to the approved plan, then Planning Commission can approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| When it determines the changes are in general conformance with the final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| So if they change something and you all still feel like it is still in substantial compliance, you would be able to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| You can also if you feel like a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| Modification should be elevated to a major modification. You can reclassify that to be approved by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| Major modifications require City Council approvements. They approve any changes to a final plan. They do not qualify as a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:27| So right now you're probably thinking well what qualifies as a minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| so there's a list in the zoning ordinance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| So basically it's an increase or decrease in building height of up to 10% or building coverage of up to 10%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:42| Location of walkways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| vehicular circulation ways parking areas a change in any of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| Up to 10 feet and up to over 10 feet and up to 20 feet for a change in parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| Also an increase or decrease in the number of parking spaces up to 10 spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| a change to the landscape plan that results in a reduction of plant material that does not violate article 12 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| altering any final grade by no more than 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| So these are the ones that you all could approve if that came back before you as a minor modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| That would not require City Council approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| in terms of major modifications, it's it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| Anything over 10% for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| or over the 10 spaces and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| Any requests for extension of time beyond what vesting rights already allows and any changes to conditions imposed as part of the approved final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2849)|
| 0:47:38| Reductions or alterations and the approved public benefit and amenities to be provided and any development action that does not comply with zoning regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Kind of bearing all of that in mind. That's kind of what's guided a few the things that are a little bit atypical in this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| For example, you have some height ranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| Here's building a it shows a height range of 90 to 132 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| So they haven't defined it yet because the ownership is not quite finalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| So if the you know, the developer that does purchase that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| Has a height that's somewhere between this range. It would not have to come back before you if it deferred from this range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| Less than 10% it would come back before you as a minor modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| If it deferred from this range more than 10% it would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| City Council approval when he commissioned density council approval and so they proposed the same for buildings B&C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| In the stadium, there's there's some Rangers. You'll also see that in building coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| So even though the IMU zone that base zone does not have a building coverage requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| Because the minor modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| describe a 10%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Building coverage increase or decrease is requiring a minor modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| That's why they've provided information as to what they the ranges they propose for building coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| And so those are the types of things that you're seeing in the final plan that might you might be wondering why that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| And that's that you'd be able to approve the final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Kind of understanding the general idea of what will to be accomplished and then it what comes through for for permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| Obviously those things would be double-checked again against the final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| And then finally the next steps if the final plan is approved by planning commissioning application will go forward to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| For consideration of amendment to the official zoning map to add the PD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| Designation and then the Planning Commission's approval or denial of phase one of the final plan is final unless the action is appeal to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| So you all's approval of the final plan is the final word in that what's going to City Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| It's not the final plan. It's the actual plan development designation on the zoning map kind of like a rezoning almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| And so I'm kind of going back to Amy's point in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| What our role is in this for the final plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| We have determined that the plan is in substantial compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| even though there are ranges and things like that proposed those ranges both the upper and the lower ends all fall within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| requirements that were approved as the exceptions in the PD or by those that are allowed by the base zone or other areas of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| And we opted to kind of handle this one similar to how we did the preliminary plan to kind of make this one more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| The process and your role and our role and how things move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| That way if anyone does have any questions at the Planning Commission meeting that that part is transparent and the plan can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| discussed in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| With that said if you have questions, we're welcome to answer them. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| Got a question, um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Can you make clarify that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| Separate from the other component that we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| Last month or the month prior regarding the signage lighting and landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| since this has a landscape bullet in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| Minor modification, right? So the applicant hasn't asked for any exceptions from the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| So when it comes through for alternative landscaping design review, that would happen like any other alternative landscaping review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| That allows them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Ask for you know deviations from certain parts of the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| But when we're looking at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| We're looking for the landscaping to be at least as good or better than what would be required under the regular ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| It doesn't allow them to deviate from the species of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| You know any of those kinds of things it's mainly just where those plantings would be located and certain little things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3091)|
| 0:51:39| Like that, but again, they haven't asked for any exceptions. So when we're reviewing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| It's not we're not reviewing it as part of the PD. We're reviewing it as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| The overall plan when that comes back for permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| So whenever they have a landscaping plan that they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| Submit that goes to the ARC. That's that multi-department review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| They approve it and then it goes to then they start pulling permits from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| Helps to clarify that it does that make sense the Administrative Review Committee is administered out of the city department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| We are party to that, of course, but and then the master sign plan you asked about that as well, right Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| That will come in at a later date and that will come that will come before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| So you all will have to review the master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| For for compliance with the preliminary plan and all the exceptions that they requested as well as just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| Generally how we review master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| so for the approval through you all and that was my big question because that was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| recollection and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Lighting is the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| We will be part of the lighting plan review, but there is a lighting component to this Michelle. Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| Talk. Yes, so they haven't submitted it at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| So whenever they do submit it, that would be you know a review between us and plans review and inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| That would be to see if it's in substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| Compliance with the final plan if it's not doing it have to come it would be either a minor or major modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| depending on what they were looking at the stadium is is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| Contained within this the lighting for the stadium the photometrics the fixtures all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| So it's really just those mixed-use buildings that would come back before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| They haven't really asked for exceptions for for any of that with the exception of some minor things. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| You know, they're asking to be able to light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| building facades to kind of highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| Certain architectural materials or landscape components. It's nothing that would be big or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| Anything that would really impact surrounding neighbors or anything like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| Like those are the types of exceptions that they've been asked for the mixed-use buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| So again, the stadium component is included here and that's the biggest part of the lighting that I think gives people the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3223)|
| 0:53:51| Has the most questions about and how that impacts the area and that is included in here. Thank you, Michelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| That's what I wanted to clarify that the lighting for the stadium is included in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| And then obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| This is a up or down. So if somebody shows up to ask us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| include other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| Subject to use we can't consider that because it's already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| Yes in terms of adding conditions during the meeting no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3256)|
| 0:54:26| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Moving on. Let's see a turn over to Mike now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3268)|

| 0:54:33| Concept use on review. This is a he's hooking up. I'll just give you a little information. This one is a concept plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| a property along Chapman Highway near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Simpson Road for an attached unit to development item and item number 10 is also associated with this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3283)|
| 0:54:54| All right, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| So this is a attached unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| 117 attached townhouses on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| This is often on Chapman Highway all the way down by Seymour, so this is right on the county board practically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| So governor John Sevier is up to the north here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| Some of the issues that you're going to hear on this one and really we haven't heard too much from public on this is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3320)|
| 0:55:27| Kind of a staff driven and developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| driven discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| Access to this site is problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| This part of Chapman Highway and why Chapman Highways you can imagine I mean for over the years. It's pretty dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3337)|
| 0:55:44| Why a lot of speed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| This is an area where TDOT has recently finished a project or just about to complete a project to widen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| Chapman Highway and made some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| This used to be a four-lane cross-section now. It's a five-lane. So they added a center turn lane here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Realigned Sevierville Pike intersection. So it tees up with Chapman Highway instead of this drastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| Sharp angle. It's now it comes in at a regular nine degree the same thing with East Simpson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3370)|
| 0:56:17| Just to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Site distance is the problem on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| Their access is just north of their south property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| TDOT has a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Standard than Knox County does for site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| the Knox County standard to the sub regs, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| 100 feet times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| the speed limit so our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| Yeah, basically, it's this is a 50 mile per hour road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| So if they have 500 feet of site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| by our regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| TDOT uses a different standard their minimum site distance six hundred six hundred and twenty five feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| So looking to the south towards Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| That's that that's the problem. There is a slight rise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| You know, we call a crest vertical curve on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| They can meet the Knox County standard of 500 feet, but they cannot meet the 625 feet by TDOT in their current location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3432)|
| 0:57:21| They may have to move their access further to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| Or if they can't meet that site distance standard, they may have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| TDOT may require them to have a restricted right turn only out of their development or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| There might be some other option that the TDOT can work with them on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| So that's a that's a big issue that that still has to be resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| number eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| basically addresses us to summary from a staff perspective so that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| The Planning Commission moves forward this month with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| Condition number eight allows staff to review a new like a realigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| driveway location further to the north and as long as they don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| additional variances that are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| That would require the Planning Commission approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| You know that we can just review that and approve that as staff. They'll still have to do a final plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| so there's still some opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| variances if needed through that process, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| We really don't anticipate the development to really change all that much if they need to shift that access point further to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3507)|
| 0:58:37| The other issue with moving it further to the north is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| The severe will Pike intersection. They do have to stay 400 feet away from that by our subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| They're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| when I say it's like 480 feet now, so if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| Get less than 400 feet, then they'd have to come back through us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| foot for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| So there there's options for them, it's just a matter of how it plays out in the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:12| Let me show you the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| This was a very similar plan was actually approved back in 2004 for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3555)|
| 0:59:23| It also had a traffic study so that this this project today has a traffic study as well. I'm done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| but back 2004 had a traffic study and it required a center turn lane in Chapman Highway and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| deceleration lane like this one has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Obviously TDOT just built a center turn lane, so they don't have to do a left turn lane today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| But it was very similar in design. I had 95 lots instead of 117| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| But the access was essentially in the same spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3591)|
| 1:00:00| Amy mentioned that there is an associated sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| That we just found out there was an error in the in the sector plan from 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| so it's a staff initiated sector plan amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| Bring it to medium-density residential from low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| the site is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| The majority of I believe is in the hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| But I can't remember when it was it's probably 2003 the site was essentially graded flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| There's really not a whole lot of hillside protection left on worth protecting on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| So that's why from a staff perspective. We really didn't address it all that much so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| Is there any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| I'm sorry if I missed this in the case file, but you said this was done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| 2004 are very similar plan very similar plan was done in 2004. They just never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| Went through with the final what's actually developing the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| the other question I have this is also about concept plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| the county and what we should anticipate because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| Case file showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| Like six different styles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Should we be looking for a specific style? That's actually being built or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| Common to say here. It might be one of these six. Oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| Of the house styles, right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| You know in an area like this where there's really no context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| I think what we're looking for is generally what kind of scale are you wanting to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| I think they showed a two and a three-story option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| So now we know generally they're gonna be in that range of height. There's nothing out here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| It would concern me with my height perspective or material perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| It's I think that we usually do just ask for give us something that's representative of what you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| And so they did provide, you know, a fairly broad range. So there are some options there for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| I think in most cases if they came in with a one-story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| Unit during our process and this was surrounded by lots of other development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| Then they came back with the three-story drain permitting. That's when we throw up some red flags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| Okay, this is a lot different than you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| Showing during the use on review process and it might get come back through again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| So we just want them to provide something so everybody gets an idea of what they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3742)|
| 1:02:33| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Got a question about the the driveway access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| What's the just to the south of that property? What's the situation with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| Driveway, is that a private road? That is a private driveway that goes back to a few houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Asked them about that, you know, is it going to stay as is so part of it goes across their property right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| So either they would have to provide an access easement for them across their property. I just don't see them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| They can't really just cut off the access has been going through that property for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| for a lot for quite a while I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| Think they just didn't really have the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| Right now to say what was going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| But I mean during the next phase of have to detail that out more it should their access should remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3799)|
| 1:03:25| Essentially as is unless they just need to modify it in some way to accommodate them and their in their own road access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3805)|
| 1:03:40| Okay, thank you Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| We've on the number 28| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| Which is 11 d 21 you are a Dominion group. This is that is a request for the county portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3826)|
| 1:03:53| The multifamily development on Maloney Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| So this is like asking me so that multifamily development on Maloney Road. So this is Money Road. It's off of Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3841)|
| 1:04:09| just south of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| Downtown Knoxville area. So this is where UT Hospital is just the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| I see King Park just to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| This property and so this development is done it's gonna be done a little bit differently than most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| What we're seeing in the or this portion for the use and review is for the county portion of the property only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| to the west is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| The city portion of the property now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| Show you here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| There's a this illustration is in the packet, but it just kind of helps highlight exactly what we're going to be reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| On the west side where the it's great out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| That's the city that in in the city that this development is permitted by rights. So they'll just go through the permit process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| And we don't need to see that necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| They are showing the entire plan because this property the plan the county portion of the property is accessed through the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| We do generally need to see how the whole developments going to to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| And we're not going to look at them in isolation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| And so that's you know in the packets, which you get the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| Again the thing that's a little bit unique about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| Because it is split jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| You know the permitting and so on like how does that happen the city as of right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| The city will do all the permitting even in the county portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| So that this happens on occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| So it's not it's not unique to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| But they will also have to meet the city standard for the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| Development not just the city portion on the county portion. They will need to meet the city standard as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| However on the county portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| They also need to meet the plan residential zone standard because it is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| PR zoned in the county and it's really not much that the PR zone would add on top of what the city already requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3965)|
| 1:06:13| Obviously, there's the zoning density. They're going through rezoning process now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| They're asked requesting plan residential up to 21 dwellings per acre in the county portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| I think this was a little less than 18. I think plan room a density. So as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| the zoning that they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Would accommodate the number of units that they have in the plan residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| They wanted to change anything on that side during permitting, you know, say the say the county only approved 12 billion units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| They would just have to reduce the amount of density the amount of density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| They have in the plan residential portion of the property to come in and compliance. So they go through permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4008)|
| 1:06:56| Let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| Had a lot of discussion with neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| Ahead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| The rezoning process really so well before the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| About the buffers around the property the northeast corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| They're protecting existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Woodland areas as you see here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| And where they aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| protecting areas they are going back with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| buffer yard with evergreen and and bushes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| deciduous trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Just to the east of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Detention pond on the southeast corner of the property. They're also going back with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| planting there is a an adjacent house in the county here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| When you're coming down Maloney Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| West on Maloney Road, oops, I'm sure what happened there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| Without this planting you would just see the sides of the apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| So it's gonna take a while for the for that plantings those plantings to grow up and to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| Start screening that those sides of the building, but hopefully over time it won't be quite as obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4090)|
| 1:08:20| Traffic on Maloney Road, yeah, it's one of the other issues that has been brought up as traffic on Maloney Road particularly going east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4100)|
| 1:08:27| There is a single lane underpass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| That's of a concern, but there's really not much that this project can do about it. It's there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| You can see it on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| Image here. I would suspect majority of people in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| Development will go to Alcoa Highway. This depends on where they're going. Obviously, it's on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| To the east they might go this direction if they're going downtown or west obviously go over to Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4130)|
| 1:09:01| Sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| That really are a driver on this part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Are going to request that they provide a sidewalk from their entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| over to the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4156)|

| 1:09:22| Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| sidewalk, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| From their entrance to the west to the traffic circle then around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| To the dresser and that will allow them my residents of this development to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| Across Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| On Maloney Road to the Greenway system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| Here this is the Knox Blount Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| Eventually that will extend all the way from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4188)|

| 1:09:58| As part of this project on Alcoa Highway, I think that we'll get to 8 IC King sooner than later on that Greenway as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4198)|
| 1:10:07| But right now they could at least get on a portion of the Greenway and get over to another part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| to the west if they care to but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| That's because they are asking for medium-density residential out here. This was you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4215)|
| 1:10:23| Something that they see is a necessary component to give some options for pedestrian access to the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4223)|
| 1:10:32| Anybody have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| Thank You Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| Any other items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| We've been like to review. Yeah, I have one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| on agenda item 21, and I apologize if you guys talked about this at last month's meeting, but there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| comment about transportation and that they were going to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| Split phasing signals at that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| I didn't know what that meant and how that was going to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| I know when we originally talked about this before postponement that there was a lot of concern about traffic at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| This is the capital drive project. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| Yeah, they've had the city of engineering departments had conversations with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| The split phasing is still going to happen. So basically the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| Traffic on the south side of that intersection and on the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| They will move at separate times so they won't have they won't won't have green arrows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| Or you know, you won't be able to move at the same time. So that's what the split phase is. But anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| The city has agreed to not require them to make the improvements to the south side of that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| they're only going to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| improvements to the north side of the capital drive intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| So there's been an agreement of what is expected to be improved as part of that project of that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| Yes, it allows for just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| Traffic to continue on on different sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| So the north so let me just go to that real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4326)|
| 1:12:15| Sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| So this is that this is that intersection with capital drive. So it'll be that new a new road on the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| Yeah, what split phase means that the traffic on the south side of the intersection they'll get the green arrow in this in the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| Side will have to stay put there. They'll have red so it'll do a complete phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| The traffic move on the south side and then they'll get the red and then the then the people on the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| Will get the green so they don't move at the same time. They're totally split. They're totally separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4361)|
| 1:12:48| Turn movements to that intersection with the stoplights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| So what's the net effect then by doing that for the traffic flow along Kingston Pike? It really didn't impact it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4371)|
| 1:12:59| Significantly it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| It didn't it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| Their analysis said there was maybe some potential benefits to it even to hold back some traffic at this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4384)|
| 1:13:11| Because it's so congested to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| Here that I actually might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Stack more cars there so that the traffic to the west can can move out before the traffic comes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| So it's all about timing with those stoplights and what makes the most benefit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| Their analysis show that it didn't really impact the traffic on Kingston Pike by doing a split phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| If I think the concern was that there was a lot of traffic that would back up right there getting on to Pellissippi, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| yeah, there's just a lot of traffic that goes through that little section there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| in general a split phase will take longer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| The cycle cars to that intersection and the concern obviously was well if it's taking longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| What's gonna happen to the traffic on Kingston Pike? Well with their study with their additional study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| They did they're able to show that it's not gonna really impact traffic on Kingston Pike by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| Having that split phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| Sounds like it might make it worse there because they're stopping the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| It's just gonna push the bottleneck further up Kingston Pike instead of putting it right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| in at that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| Yeah, I mean I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| talk to you a bit more after and one of the engineers might be able to discuss it some but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| Yeah, it sounded like there was potentially some benefit to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| Backing some cars at that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4476)|
| 1:14:51| Wednesday, yes. Thank you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211108-agenda-review?start=4491)|
