| 0:30:12| but I will make sure that I have that before Monday along with her resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1812)|

| 0:30:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Sent on without a recommendation. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1822)|

| 0:30:32| It's approving addendum number 2 to the lease and operating agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| between the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1835)|

| 0:30:50| and to increase the monthly rent beginning July 1, 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| from $3,500 to $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1854)|

| 0:30:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| I had a question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Allison or the Sheriff, this is a $500 increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| This will go into effect with next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| Is there a specific reason for the increase? Is it just cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| I was contacted by the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| and he said there had not been an increase since 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| so this is why they were going to increase it. There was no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Okay. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| And we have put the increase in the budget, requested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| Motion is to approve. All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Go, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| We've already voted. This is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| A point of order that I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Joe Lee, I don't know if we can do this or not, but if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| We've got here on our screen it says it's budgeted or not on items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| I think it would help showing transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| We could have on these printouts that go out to the public and whatnot on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| where it says, you know, we're approving some money right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Well, we approved $3,000. It may be $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| But what we need to let the community know is, was it budgeted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| Has it been approved? Or was it grant money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Is it pass-through money or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| So people will know this is something that's already been discussed in the past year or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| I'd like if we could put on there, it's on when we open up our sheet, but put it on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| When people come up and get this, they know, number one, was it budgeted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Or no, it wasn't budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Or is it pass-through grant money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| And how long is that grant money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Is that something that we need as commissioners to be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| We've had this grant forever and ever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Or is this something that's fixing just to go away in two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| So I don't know if that's something, Mr. Chairman, we need to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| or if that's something you as chairman can get with Joe Lee about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| I'll get with Joe Lee and see if we can do that and see how feasible it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| I have some other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| So the budget has not been approved for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| This will be in your budget request for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| We are budgeted $3,500 a month currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| We have put in $4,000 a month in the new budget for FY12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| That motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| The next item is on page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| It's item number 21, resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| It's amending the budgeted revenues between the general fund, the library fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| and the solid waste fund in order to maintain the separate special revenue fund status of the library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| and solid waste funds under the guidelines of the governmental accounting standards board statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| GASBS number 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| These amendments do not authorize any additional spending between or among any of the said funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Mr. Troyer, can you tell us briefly what this is about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| The governmental accounting standards board is one of the ruling bodies that we operate under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| and they have passed a new statement, statement number 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| that changes the rules on how we can present financial information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| One of the rule changes would make all of our spending for libraries and solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| instead of a standalone financial statement for libraries and solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| would be rolled into and be a part of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| So what I'm trying to do with this resolution is to maintain those separate status for the library fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| and for the solid waste fund so that we can report separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| here's your library operations, here's your solid waste operations by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| And so we're asking for no additional spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| but this, I think, helps maintain the transparency that we would lose if we don't take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Oh, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| So just a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Is this something specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| or are there going to be other things that's going to come as a result of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| or the other areas that we may not be in compliance with the general accounting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| It's a new statement, so this new standard will go into effect on June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| And so what we're trying to do in anticipation of that change is to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| and change our budget accordingly so we can still have a separate library financial statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| separate solid waste financial statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| But for this aspect, this statement that they made, Statement 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| this puts us in 100% compliance of that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Maybe some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| There's a number of other things that we'll have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| and that will just be a part of our normal year-end process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| But what this would do is this is, as far as I understand our requirements under the statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| is this is all we would need to do to maintain just the way that we've been presenting financial information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| I attended the four-hour session trying to inform elected officials about this particular statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2147)|
| 0:35:57| and I think the word that I like to use is, does money come to us with strings attached?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2157)|
| 0:36:05| In other words, we receive some monies from the state that can only be spent for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2165)|
| 0:36:13| These two particular funds collect certain monies and dedicate them, in other words, strings attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2173)|
| 0:36:23| these funds can only be spent for certain things as we stand right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| That hurts us, I think, is the way I would look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| whenever it comes down to outside lenders of money looking at us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| at how we have money in the collective general pot of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| as opposed to there's money in there that has strings attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| In other words, people don't look at us financially about that money that's dedicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| What's the word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| I don't even remember the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Restricted is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| So you see, we get really deep really quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| and the lenders of money do not consider streams of funds that are restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2222)|
| 0:37:11| They only consider stuff that we have control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| It's like paying our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| So we've really got far afield, or I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| I just want you to know that this is really technical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| and being a part of the audit committee or attending the UT session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| that just gives you a four-hour overview of all these different categories of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| and how it's accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| This is something that we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| So our motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| The next item is number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| It's resolution 902, approving an appropriation in the amount of $23,755.36| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| for the purpose of reimbursing former Knox County Commissioner Paul Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| for reasonable attorney's fees incurred while successfully defending an ouster lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| as provided by Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| So it's moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Oh, the motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| Also, I would like to ask, on a personal note, Commissioner Smith was brought before the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| It was very obvious that it was politically motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| He had to hire an attorney for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Commissioner Smith, would you get us your fees for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| I think that it's only fair that we consider that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| I just think fair is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| So if you wouldn't mind doing that, let us consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| The next item is on page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| Item number 25, it's resolution 903,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| ratifying the rules promulgated by the Knox County Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| relative to a process by which employees, taxpayers, or other citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| may confidentially report suspected illegal, improper, wasteful, or fraudulent activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| This is something the audit committee has been working on for, gosh, a year or so, David and Amy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2366)|
| 0:39:35| and there have already been some calls to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| And I think some of them, you may have read the media stories, some of them have been a little frivolous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| but it's something that we have been working on and very pleased to finally bring it to reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| so the citizens can call in anything they think they see that's out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| Just as minor as people smoking cigarettes in county vehicles to stealing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2393)|
| 0:40:03| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| It has taken the audit committee some time to get this out and up because of, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| to begin with, the audit committee is working, I guess, commission has it because the state says we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| The hotline we have because the state says we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| This is not an issue with me in that I do not view it as people tattling on someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2423)|
| 0:40:32| This is serious stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| This is taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| This is citizen money in Knox County that we need to be looking after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Anyone that would see something taking place that they think to be fraudulent, it has to come to light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| and the only people that can bring it to light is someone that might know that it's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| So I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| I've been involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Commissioner Royals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Yes, I'm going to ask that this be, offer a substitute motion that this be deferred for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| to allow the audit committee to meet one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| And I agree with you guys that we have to do this and it's important and we should do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| but there's a couple of things that have come to light since the last audit committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| that I'm not able to discuss with my colleagues because of the Sunshine Law that I think are significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| and potentially damaging that need to be worked out about this, particularly in terms of, and you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2486)|
| 0:41:36| this is serious and it shouldn't be silly, but it's going to get silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| I think that, and let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| One of the concerns I have is that once these investigations have ceased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| that every complaint is going to become a matter of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| Someone, for example, if the mayor runs for re-election in three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| someone who doesn't like the mayor and doesn't want to see him get re-elected can call every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| for six months if they want to and lodge a complaint against the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| Whether, you know, it's as silly as, you know, I saw the mayor, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| do away with two people and bury them by the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| They can call and make that allegation and it has to be investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| and then after the investigation is discharged, it becomes a matter of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| So all the media has to do if they want to cause problems, and I'm not saying that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| but I'm just saying this is a hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| We run a front page story saying county mayor receives 300 complaints on whistleblower hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2551)|
| 0:42:39| And I think that that's something that the audit committee needs to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| that's an unintended consequence that the audit committee needs to go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| with the advice of our law director and make sure that we don't have any unintended consequences from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2568)|
| 0:43:00| So I would make a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days to give the audit committee an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| to look at those sorts of issues that might arise because of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| and see if we can fix it before there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| I have a substitute motion. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Let me ask Joe Jarrett, do you see, since this has already become reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2597)|
| 0:43:25| do you see a problem with Amy's deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| You can call in the hotline right now. I think it's been up for a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| Well, this resolution, sir, before you, R113903, those are your written procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2615)|
| 0:43:43| Those are your written policies and procedures for investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| separate distinct from the hotline, which is already operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| But when I first drafted these rules, of course, I distributed them to the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| and asked for input and incorporated therein some of the suggestions that were offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| But I believe you will meet prior to the next audit committee, this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| Exactly. We meet the day before. The audit committee meets the day after the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| So the audit committee meets in five weeks and a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| So I guess it would need to be 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| 60 days. I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| And this morning I got an e-mail report of one of these that I consider silly in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2665)|
| 0:44:35| and that my understanding was that all of this was going to be handled confidentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| So we've already got, in my opinion, one silly report accusing someone of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| And I'm wondering now, is that the investigation is discharged? Is it no longer confidential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| Can the paper run it as a story tomorrow morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| That's why I'd like to have this deferred, just to give us an opportunity to make those determinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| I guess, so the hotline is operational right now, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Since we're going to defer this for 60 days it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| would it be possible for us to have a report on the functioning of the hotline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| That is, who does the hotline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Some kind of summary report about its activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| How long has it been operational?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| What types of complaints have been waged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Do we have categories? Is there abuse or misuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| I would just like to see how is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| Is it just something that's just another unnecessary burden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| Is it working like it's supposed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| It's been working a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| And Mark Jones is basically the coordinator of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| So I'll be glad to ask Mark to come up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Something like that I think would be helpful, at least for those of us that don't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| We found out that Dean Rice bought a new truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| And we all expect to be ridden around in it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| This is not only for elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| This is for employees, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| So if someone says an axe to grind against a fellow employee, they can pick up the phone and call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| I agree with Commissioner Burwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| I think we really need to take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| Because you're talking about people's character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| You're talking about their jobs, their livelihoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| And if somebody just has an axe to grind and can pick up the phone and say anything and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| which we've seen they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| I just think that we need to have some kind of procedure that these frivolous things are just not out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| I mean, let's look at the things that are serious and meaningful and have some substance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| but not just because somebody's got an axe to grind or somebody just wants to play games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| And I'll ask Mark tomorrow, but a lot of the calls will no question be frivolous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| or be somebody with an axe to grind or somebody mad about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| And that's what took us a long time to finally get this into practically working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| So I'll be glad to try to get some information on it for the whole commission next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| Is there a way when these calls come in that they are kept confidential until investigated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2831)|
| 0:47:19| That is the law presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| The problem is afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| People, any time you have a hotline, I've been involved in these for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| you're always going to get a virtual panoply of absurd calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| That's just the price of doing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| As you establish a hotline, you're going to presume that, separating the wheat from the chaff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| The problem is, of course, people are, since they have complete anonymity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| they have no problem sending in anything that's defamatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| or that in all likelihood in a perfect world could lead to defamation lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| Well, that's just like I said a minute ago, jokingly, but it was in a paper a week or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| Dean bought a new truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| It's already been reported on that hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| So, I mean, that's kind of stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| Okay, the motion is to defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| So Dean's going to tell us what color the truck is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| And do you have leather seats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| He'll come up here and clear his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| I did buy a used car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| My wife and I are currently paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| You need some insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| The 60-day deferral is on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| Item number 26 is Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| It's approving amendments to the Knox County Commission rules as recommended by the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| to, number one, change the meeting time to hear beer matters at 3 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| to hear the legislative agenda at 4 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| and for the zoning session to remain at 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| and, number two, include the approval of notary public applications on the legislative agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| I'm actually the chairman of the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| and brought this based on what the Rules Committee has stated they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| But I was the lone vote against it on the Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| and I just want to tell you why I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| I think that I like keeping zoning at 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| and I just think things are working really well right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| and I don't think we need to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| You know, if you're leaving two hours for legislative things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| when things get, you know, when we get into budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| when we get into zoning, when the economy is picking back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| when we get into all this stuff about our meetings are not going to be two hours forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| We're going to have good agendas, but we're going to have tough agendas in the next six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| and I don't think that two hours is going to be enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| and we're going to be here until midnight, irritable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| I think the way we have it now is working, and I think we ought to leave it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Some of you all remember going into the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| I think it was 1.30 the next day, and we're going to have some long meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| so I would be in favor of leaving it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Commissioner Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Yes, I'm also on the Rules Committee, but I was absent for that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| but I would have voted with Commissioner Anders on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| The problem I have is the same that's been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| Guys, we've been doing a good job, I think, getting through our agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| but there are going to be times coming up when it's going to drag on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| and also nights that we're going to have really long zonings, as we've seen recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| So if we don't finish our legislative agenda before zonings, we're going to be here late, late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| and speaking as a mom or as a parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| I would prefer to get home before my children go to bed, like most people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| and also I want to remind you all that what we get up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| no offense to the folks who prepare it, but it's not a healthy meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| and all of you guys do better if you have dinner between our legislative agenda and zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3047)|
| 0:50:55| because when your blood sugar drops, everybody gets a little cranky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| and you don't do your best work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| So I think it's beneficial for us if we have a break to get a real meal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| between our legislative agenda and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| Maybe a yoga stretch also there sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| So perhaps we could have lattes and fillets, and that would help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| How do I follow that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| As I said in the committee meeting, and I'm, again, I'm okay with however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| as I said initially when we wanted to move it later, I'm okay with however the body wants to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| and as you see, I'm here, but let's look around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| What members of the public are here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| One, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| Three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| No, we're not calling you public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| If we're serious about this whole notion of open access, then we need to do it after people work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| Most people in Knox County punch a clock for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| That's my sole reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| I'm okay with meeting 8 o'clock in the morning, 6 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| But let's be real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Let's say it works better for us, like Commissioner Andrews said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| It blends nicely with lunch into the meeting, gives us a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| Like Commissioner Burrell said, we can eat a meal and then come back for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| But if we're serious about taking the meetings to the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3139)|
| 0:52:28| every other elected body like this is meeting post after 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| If that's not what we want to do, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| If that doesn't fit well within the way we have it set up, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| But the reason I'm supporting this amendment is because as we've seen month after month after year after year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3161)|
| 0:52:50| when issues come forward, Carter School being one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| let's hold off after 6 or after the zoning to give people time to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| That's what we say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| So what do we say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| We only want people to hear when there's a hot-button issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| Or do we want people to have an opportunity to take part in this process that is conducive to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3187)|
| 0:53:17| and may not be conducive to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| It's the job of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| And, again, I'm fine either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| The hours are the hours, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| And like we said earlier with the fee offices, we can go back to we met at 2 o'clock in the morning one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3205)|
| 0:53:32| I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| But it ain't happening now, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| We have a different agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| We have a different process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| We're 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| We're not 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| So, you know, again, I'm fine either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| So if we're serious about taking this to the public, eat your Wheaties before you get here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| and let's take care of the business of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| As I've said before when we talked about changing times on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| the issue shouldn't be to our convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| We're here to serve the public and those that come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| We can't talk to each other unless it's a sunshine meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| Most of the information we get has to be at a workshop or here at a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| The people we need here during that time are those who are in the building doing work hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| unless it's a zoning matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| So it's been working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| I think that they would appreciate it that they can get in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| and get their part done before they have to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| So I'm in favor of leaving the hours like they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| I'm in favor of leaving things relatively like they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| I do not see us moving the beer board to three o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| and expecting them to get through with the commission agenda before six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| And also I view the chairman's lunch as working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| And I've seen us be pushed from our 11 o'clock eating to being at beer board at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3319)|
| 0:55:29| All I'm offering in this is just a small tweaking of what's taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| in that we eat at, say, 12 and have beer board at 1.30 or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| because right now it's tough sometimes to get from the chairman's lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| to whatever is being presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| And we need to give those people that are presenting that particular meal program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| time to get their point across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| And if we're starting at 11.30 and maybe then not starting until 11.45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| and we've got to be in this room and prepared for the beer board at 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| maybe there is some room in here to give us a little bit of freedom on the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| But I can't see us going to beer at the later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| Mr. Chairman, and I really enjoy your chairman's lunches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| They're very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| You put a lot of time into it and you have timely topics that we talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| What if we moved our luncheon to the day that we have our workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| and have that at 12 and have our workshop, say, at 1.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| You could just move your chairman's lunch up one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| That's just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| Mr. Burrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| I think that last month, if we had started at 4 o'clock last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| we probably would have gone pretty late because that with zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| and the other things that we talked about, that was a pretty packed evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| Our constituents and the residents of Knox County have hired us to do a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| and I agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| but I think they're also expecting us to do the best job that we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| And so we need to think about what does it take for us to do the best job that we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| I also think that beer board has been going real smoothly, or very smoothly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3442)|
| 0:57:30| and that we seem to get through that pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| So could I offer a substitute motion that we have beer board at 3.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3453)|
| 0:57:40| and start commission at 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Not 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Yeah, I'm sorry, 1.30 and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| Because you've got 1.45, you've got honorariums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Okay, then no substitute motion from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| What about changing that chairman's lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| From what time to what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| Instead of doing it on the meeting day, have it on the work session day, like today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| We would have had it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Either one is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| I like the lunch on the important day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| Could we not do lunch at 11.30 instead of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| We're at 11.30 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Start at 11.15, give everybody 15 minutes to be late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| It's a long day, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Any way you cut it up, it's a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| What will we get paid for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Can I make a substitute motion to strike number one from the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| and keep number two to include the approval of notary public applications on a legislative agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| because it's a housekeeping measure that Jolie asked me to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| Any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| I just want to let folks know, you know, I don't know who brought this forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| but someone brought this forward for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| So I guess I'm saying it sounds like this substitute motion is going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3546)|
| 0:59:13| I guess it's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| It's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| So let's settle down then and quit bringing these things forward because I think the other one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| had something, I think what was brought to the committee was something different than what we're doing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| and what this one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| I think in the committee meeting I'm pretty sure we changed the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| I think what happened, someone wanted to eliminate that gap is what I think was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| But, again, I'll say, you know, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| and I think I heard Brad say it under his breath and I agree with it, we're getting paid for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| These employees in this building, they're getting paid for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| That's not my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| My concern with, I guess, pushing these later start times is with the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| and I still feel that way and I don't think anything's been said in this discussion that changes my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3610)|
| 1:00:18| that while not a disservice to citizens, it is not a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3618)|
| 1:00:26| It's not us going the extra mile to allow citizens to participate in the process as fully as we might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3626)|
| 1:00:36| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Are we, Brad deleted, did you delete the time changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| The substitute motion deleted the time changes, which was number one, subsection number one there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| and kept number two, which puts the approval of the notary public on the legislative agenda, which it's not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| So you're leaving it status quo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Status quo, except adding the notary public on the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| When I think of the huge deals we've had, Carter School, Midway, the two three-hour workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| whatever we call them, the last couple of weeks on Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| I've yet, I may get three tonight, but I've yet to hear somebody call me and say you disenfranchised me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| because I couldn't get to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| I think we are fairly accommodating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| I understand what Commissioner McKenzie says, but I think it's going to be a big hot button issue with the room packed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3681)|
| 1:01:30| and even if it's not, I think we are doing, I like the times as we have them, and I would support leaving them alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| The other issue that we had was we would have people who would be here at 1.30 for a 2 o'clock meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| and we would go until 6 o'clock with zonings, and we would stop, do zonings, and then come back with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| Well, these people would sit through and be here hours waiting on an item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| and so that was one of the things we wanted to get away from is forcing people to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| having to sit through zonings, and then come back and finish our legislative agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| I think we've done a really good job of getting the legislative agenda out of the way so that we can focus on zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| and we don't have to have people sit here for hours waiting until after those zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| for an item that they may have a particular interest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| So the motion, substitute motion is to eliminate subsection one and just have subsection two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| It is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| I'm with Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Was there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Sam didn't oppose after this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| Are you in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| So you're saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| Commissioner Smith said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| I don't want to be said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| And McKenzie, did you say no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Three no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| The next item is number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| It's ordinance O-11-2-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| It's amending Article 2, Article 4, and Article 5 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| regarding regulations for private swimming pools, regulations in the PR plan residential zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| and definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130 adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| Make a motion for no action because it's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| Can't vote on ordinance today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| No action, just send it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| So we really can't do anything on it today, so we'll send it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| I guess there's a, does someone want to, maybe on Monday, we don't have to do it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| maybe from zoning, does someone give a overall justification for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3812)|
| 1:03:40| get it out there on the record while we're doing what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| So that would be a note to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| Also, Jolie, if you would make sure that we have someone from codes here to talk about this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| We talked about that on the day of the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| It's basically just bringing the codes together with the current zonings and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3837)|
| 1:04:06| It's not a great big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| I mean, it's more of a housekeeping thing, Commissioner McKenzie, than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| Yes, and that's why I just want someone just to kind of clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| This is why we did what we did, vote and be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| Number 29, discussion regarding the Salt Lake Green Waste Facility contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| I had a Randy Graves that wanted to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| I don't know, I don't see him here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| So I guess we'll just defer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| He said he might have conflict with the spring break with his kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| So we'll look at that Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| Page 7, item 30, presentation by TVA representative to discuss their switchyard plans at Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3885)|
| 1:04:55| I'm on the Development Corporation Board, as is Commissioner Andrews and Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| and we had this presentation from Mr. Napier and folks from TVA to talk about what's going on at Midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| with the switchyard plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| There's basically nothing we can do, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| so we wanted to make you aware of what is going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| But, Mr. Napier, if you would, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Name and address of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Todd Napier, Development Corporation, Knox County, 17 Markey Square, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| I don't have a lot to add beyond what Commissioner Hammond has just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| other than I wanted you to have the opportunity to understand what TVA is proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3928)|
| 1:05:35| It came before Development Corporation Board in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| The bottom line is TVA has studied this and has condemnation power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| so we've worked with them to come to what we believe is a fair resolution on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| and wanted you to understand that this was not part of the business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| had never been part of the business park, and it was going to happen here regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| But Carolyn Marvel is with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| She is a senior project manager and she distributed a brief handout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| and she's going to quickly go through that and be able to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| And if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| I'm Carolyn Marvel with Tennessee Valley Authority, 1101 Market Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| I'll try to keep this very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| As Todd's indicated, we went to the Development Corporation Board in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3986)|
| 1:06:33| and we finalized the details now, I believe, on where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| As you're aware, TVA is the nation's largest power producer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| and we try to achieve a 99.999% reliability, and we've been able to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4003)|
| 1:06:51| We do studies of our transmission system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| and this was identified as a gap back in about 2005-2006 time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| A picture is worth a thousand words, so if you'll turn to page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| The Volunteer East NOx project, the need was identified in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| Up at the top you see the Volunteer 500 kV substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| We've got some line overloads projected in 2014 and 2017 on either of those lines going into the NOx substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4036)|
| 1:07:25| We've also got some loading issues between Nixon Road and Dumplin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| So the East NOx substation, which is there at Midway Road area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| will be to construct a 14-mile transmission line between Volunteer all the way to the new East NOx site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4055)|
| 1:07:45| We've been through a lot of analysis and a lot of soil borings and considered several sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| and this ended up being the best one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| If you'll turn to page three, and the numbers are on the bottom left side, it shows two lines, a red line and a yellow line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4074)|
| 1:08:03| If you start with a circle towards the bottom, that's where we're projecting the new site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| TVA already owns about five and a half miles of right-of-way, which we've owned for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| The red line will continue on up towards the left side, the top of the page, to Volunteer substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| So that's where we're, the area we're projecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| The preferred site is on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| It's on the Development Corporation of NOx County property, and it's in what I believe was referred to as phase three, Todd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4113)|
| 1:08:43| Yeah, it's in that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| And so it's shown kind of the location where we've agreed on the site needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4126)|
| 1:08:54| And if you turn to page five, it shows kind of the substation site and the layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| and the intent is for KEB to co-locate with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| We'll be on the southern side, and they'll be on the northern side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4145)|
| 1:09:13| And if you go to the last page, this is kind of where we are, what we're doing, where we're heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| Back in 2008, we announced the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| We actually conducted an open house with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| We announced the preferred site areas in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| We've refined that now and selected a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| And last month, as we stated, we went before the Development Corporation of NOx County, and we're starting the project now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4174)|
| 1:09:42| So none of the design has been officially done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| The letters went out to the property owners, I guess, back in the December, January timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| So those have been released, and we'll be working with them as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| With gaining the new right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| I think it's important to note that TVA, during the board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| specifically stated they wanted to work with the community and try to create buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| and be understanding that we can't stop them from being there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| but they wanted to be part of the community and a good neighbor, and they're going to do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| So we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| That's going to be part of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Could you go into what kind of buffering you're going to do to kind of soften this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| We had a lot of discussion about that, and I guess at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| the best thing we've looked at is potentially putting some evergreens on the west side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| which would pretty much go that length of the, between the, down both sides of the substation, switching station site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4241)|
| 1:10:50| And then working with Todd, we'll look at giving the development corporation some rights on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4250)|
| 1:10:58| where they can do landscape and make it a public use area as they see fit, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| And I see the scale here, but in terms of rough acreage, what are we talking about between the KUB and TVA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4263)|
| 1:11:12| All total, now it's about 34 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| And then my last question, I guess, is I see your rationale is primarily stability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| and then based on your reliability numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| But I'm assuming there will be some capacity actualized by adding this substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| Not from our perspective, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| We've got breakers and more ability to move our loads around as we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| It's primarily what's working for the switching station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Added benefit is not capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| I mean, if you add a substation, it seems like you have some capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Well, it won't be on TVA's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| What we're looking at is putting in a switching station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| which gives us the ability to move loads as they need to move, primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| I appreciate TVA being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| First off, I need to say that I can look out my kitchen window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| and throw a stone in to volunteer if I really had a good arm and a little bit of tailwind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| So I understand the size, the scope, the magnitude of whatever it is that TVA is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| Plus, it's giving an interconnect to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| But there are several things that maybe rise out of this from a community point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| Since I represent those people, I guess I need to ask the questions of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| I've attended public meetings in the past, in the last three years, related to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| And I've heard people talk about the dedicated right-of-way that's about a century old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| that's going to be used in getting half the way from volunteer down to this new substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4377)|
| 1:13:06| If you went to Todd in February, Todd Napier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| and asked for or negotiated an ability to maybe locate this site on their property in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4389)|
| 1:13:20| what kind of community involvement has been encouraged in involving the community in what's taking place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4400)|
| 1:13:30| Have there been public hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| We don't go through public hearings as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| We went through the open house, and then we'll go through our environmental assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| which they do a lot of studies and a lot of analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| And it's pretty much a public process in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| And that's the next process that will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| Okay, so there's going to be then public meetings with showing this to the Carter community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| The public meeting showing it to the Carter community happened in 2008 with the open house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| Right, and that was on the southwest corner of this interstate exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| And you're probably, if not several thousand yards away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| you're considerably further north than what was being presented at the open house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| We looked on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| The road or the site was deemed not suitable by both TVA and KEB because of the soil conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4463)|
| 1:14:31| Right, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| There's quite a bit of rock down there, I think, is really the main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| But the point I'm making is that although maybe you do not have to be here as TVA presenting to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4477)|
| 1:14:47| but since you're here presenting to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| what was presented to the community at the open house has now significantly changed, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| It really hasn't, sir, because we looked at both the ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| we drew a big circle around the general area where we would have to go look to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| And we had leaned towards that site, but we considered several ones in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4505)|
| 1:15:13| And I do not remember a location on the ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| There wasn't a specific location because it had not been selected at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| It was a general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| But as you and I have just spoken, we believed it to be south and west of the interstate exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| That's where we tried to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| And I would like for the people in Carter to be involved in at least knowing that this is coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| through a process other than what they thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4542)|
| 1:15:50| There again, it's public perception and it's going to be to your all's best advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| to TVA's best advantage to work with the people in Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| A second question that I have is that of the property that I assume that we're saying is owned by the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| 30-some acres, my first concern would be how is it screened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| Other sites of this nature, if they're located in other parts of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4577)|
| 1:16:24| get a little bit more than chain-link fence and cedar trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| as in some locations have fairly significant well-designed brick walls and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4589)|
| 1:16:39| They have a little bit of architectural design to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Are we saying because this is off the interstate and Carter that it's not going to get a treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| of making it a little bit more presentable than, well, maybe you said pine trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| Or that the development corporation can do their landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| That's like saying your next-door neighbor, TVA's come in, they've built something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| and now the next-door neighbor's got to beautify the area that's TVA's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| That was never the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| Okay, but I think I heard it presented that way just a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| And then one of my other concerns is, this was to Todd Napier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| the 30 or so, 40 acres that they're going to take from this development, are they landlocking you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| Are they ultimately knocking you out of maybe six or eight acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| It looks like you have on the page four the preferred site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| It looks like you have north and east of that outside their circle, but their circle is on the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4660)|
| 1:17:48| The yellow circle is on the red line, and you have property to the east and north of their preferred site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4668)|
| 1:17:57| Page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| When we came to the development corporation board in February, there was about six, we estimated about six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| They've since surveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| It's about 6.7 acres north of what they were going to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| That was a concern that I expressed and the board expressed about having basically a remnant piece of property that we couldn't use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| It wasn't quite landlocked, but it was very inaccessible for any future use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| So TVA has come back to us and agreed to acquire that as part of this, and that's what's taken it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| It was about 28 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| It's now at 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| So, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| And then one last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| And all of what I'm saying are just comments coming from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| The last comment is that this past Saturday I went to Maryville to Tyler Brothers Equipment Auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4720)|
| 1:18:49| Don't laugh at me, Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| My wife will be calling you on the phone here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| The person that I guess is farming the location or someone associated with that, Todd Napier, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4736)|
| 1:19:09| I thought you were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| No, I'm through with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| But you have a tenant there on the property, someone that's taking care of the property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| Mr. Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| And he has agricultural crops and cattle and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| Newly developed sinkhole occurred in this heavy rain session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| and the person was relaying to me that they had to get out with a tractor and get down in one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| and drag out a cow and a new calf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| So this needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| I'm making it part of the record here up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| This is not really a good location for industrial sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| and it may not be a good location for a TVA site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| But I'll go back to my first statement then and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| I don't know whether you need to be here to tell us or not, but since you're here, you had to listen to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| This is not anything for any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| Just a period of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| And for sharing this with us and your willingness to come and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| The next item is number 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| It's discussion regarding the Knox County Pension Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Ms. Bennett, you're here, so would you mind coming down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| And also Mr. Cross is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| While they walk down there, I may make a brief announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| I'm sorry I wasn't quick enough on my feet an hour ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| We have a 9 o'clock meeting Thursday when Amy has scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| or Commissioner Brawls has scheduled something with Ms. McCroskey and possibly Ms. Quist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| A three-hour meeting is scheduled that the professionals here may elaborate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4845)|
| 1:20:53| But I wanted everyone to put that on their calendar if you're interested in pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| We have a meeting then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| And it will not be about the additional people trying to join the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| And that will be discussed in a week from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| Right, Kim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| That will be discussed a week from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| So I just wanted people to know we have some things planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| That's why I wanted Ms. Bennett to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| So there is a meeting and the Commission is invited to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| And could you give us just a brief synopsis of what this meeting is going to be Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| It's going to be from 9 until 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| And if the Commissioners would like to come, they're welcome to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| Yes, this meeting will be talking about funding for the defined benefit plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| and where we're sitting with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| It will be talking about the actual evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| And it will be talking with investment managers for the funding for the DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| And it starts at 9 o'clock in room 361, I think is the room number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| And I just want the Commissioners to be aware of that because you hear a lot about pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| And this meeting is going to be delving into particularly that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| And, Mr. Cross, just a quick question for you, Ms. Bennett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| unless somebody else has other questions for you and we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| But, Mr. Cross, there has been a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| I know we've discussed it in the pension board meetings about the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| where we're going, the funding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Could you just give us a brief synopsis of where you see us now in Knox County with our pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| as far as its funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Are we in good shape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| And I know this is going to be discussed on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| but just kind of give us your feeling on where we are right now with our pension plan in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| Bob Cross, President of the Southeast USI Consulting Group and Midwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| 900 South Gay Street, Suite 1796.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| Well, I would say as a citizen of Knox County, I'm glad that I live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| as opposed to some other areas, especially with respect to the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| There's been some discussion in the paper relative to the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| and in no way is this any kind of a negative statement whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| Those contributions are projected to go from $11.3 million this year to $30.7 million in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4976)|
| 1:23:05| With respect to the county, the contributions this year will be approximately $6.7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| growing in the year 2019 to $7.3 to $7.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| The funded ratio for these plans, the Knox County defined benefit plans, are in the 80% or better range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=4997)|
| 1:23:26| The actuarial assumption is 7.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| On a national basis in most state retirement systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| that puts the county's assumption from the standpoint of being cautious or conservative in the top 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5013)|
| 1:23:40| The asset smoothing, or there's a process that's used on an actuarial basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| is also more conservative than 90% of the other systems that are on a state basis, state by state basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5025)|
| 1:23:54| From an overall perspective, the Knox County system is in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| Now, will there be an increase in contribution this year? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| We also used an asset smoothing technique, in this case over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| And that asset smoothing technique means that we will not recognize all the losses that occurred a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5050)|
| 1:24:18| Similarly, we're not going to recognize all the gains that took place last year and hopefully this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| But the bottom line is we can expect on a short-term basis an increase in the contributions to the retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5063)|
| 1:24:31| And that could be as much as a couple of million dollars over the next two to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| So on a long-term basis, when we look at contributions to all three plans, I think those are fairly steady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5076)|
| 1:24:44| And the assumptions that are being utilized, have been utilized in the past, are cautious, conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5084)|
| 1:24:53| I'll stop at that point, see if there are any questions or thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Yes, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| Mr. Cross, one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| Is that 6.7 and 7.3 that you're projecting out into the future, does that include the 6%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5100)|
| 1:25:09| That the county already, if they were in a 401K, the county would give 6% of their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| That's not including that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| So that's just what the contribution needs to be from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| Yes, these are strictly contributions to the defined benefit plans, three plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| Does not include the contribution to the defined contribution plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| That would be the 401A and the 457.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| That would be more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| But I mean, if a deputy was in the 401K plan, he would get 6% anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5134)|
| 1:25:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| And so if we're doing 6% of his salary, he's given 6% and the county's given 6%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| is the county's 6% counted in that 6 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| Am I clear in my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| The contribution that you are, the county's contribution is 15% of pay for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| So that 6% would be contributed by the police officer, sheriff's officer, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| and 15% of pay would be contributed by the county in the upcoming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Mr. Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| This, I'm sorry, this doesn't have to do with the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| I was just, thanks for giving me the heads up, Ed, about the pension money on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| Julie said she would call Joy and Kathy and see if we could do those walk-throughs on Wednesday instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5184)|
| 1:26:30| So she'll let everybody know if that's going to happen, so it will be sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| Well, thank you all for coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| I just wanted to do this just to inform commission that basically things are fine in Knox County, as you've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| We are looking at an increase, and you give us some numbers that we need to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| but it's nothing like we're seeing in some of the other states and, you know, our counterparts in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| So, again, thank you for a job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| And we hope that if you can, avail yourselves of this meeting on Thursday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| One or two quick items here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| I think that's a good point Brad mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| I think so, in essence, it's a 21% contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| Six of it flows through as payroll, but the other 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| That's how Bob, each year, the actuary will say, this year you need to contribute 13% of payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| or 16% of payroll or this year 15% of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| And that 15 equates to the $6 million odd dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| I wanted to ask Joe, a pension related, or Mr. Jarrett, are members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| and I mentioned this to you earlier, a couple hours ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| members of the pension board are just like members of county commission, are they not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| in that we are subject to the Sunshine Law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| Yes, it's a Sunshine Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Okay, so anyone that's sworn member of the pension board needs to be. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| Yeah, it would be wise to have any discussions in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| In a public meeting, okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| And the other thing, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, we will be, I don't know if we're voting on it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| but they will be on the agenda to add the people in the work for the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| at Monday's meeting a week from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| That's proposed to be, that's on the agenda as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| That's the one that got a lot of publicity Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| Commissioner McKenzie, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Gentlemen, come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| And my question is, your 6.7 to 7 point whatever in 2019 fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5304)|
| 1:28:33| did that have the uniformed officer still at 6% and us still at 15%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5313)|
| 1:28:42| I mean, based on what Ed's saying, or does that, you know, do the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| It would take a change for the individual to contribute more than 6%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| and that would be a legal question there in terms of how that 6% could be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| From the county's perspective, the contribution as a percentage of pay, we project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| would increase from 15% currently to 16%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| So it would increase 1% in the year 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| So I guess that's not an apples to apples comparison with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| So that's basically saying that in order for us to only go up 6.7 to 7.3 whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| we would have to do something to get the officers to increase their portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5364)|
| 1:29:33| I'm not an attorney, but I've done this a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| I would think, yes, there would be some modification required to the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| and perhaps other documents to increase the contribution from 6% to some other figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| Because if we don't have that, our numbers would look not as bad as the city's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| but would look pretty darn bad, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| I guess what I'm trying to do, I'm just trying to get a summary of where we are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| and if we do nothing, where we're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| It's a little, you have to dig in a little deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| In my opinion, from my standpoint, when you go from 6.7 to 7.3, that means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| Something else has to happen for that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| One of the other things I would note, that does assume a 3.5% per year salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| So if salary increases were less than that, that contribution would want to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| In the city, 11.3 in the year 2010 to 30.7 in 2019, that's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5428)|
| 1:30:38| Oh, yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| We're not in that, but we've got our own issues to deal with as well, so I guess that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| Whenever I'm on the audit committee, I sit over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| I know Dr. Casella has asked a couple of questions about rates of return, and we're wrestling with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5455)|
| 1:31:02| Today, comparing, saying Knoxville is in good shape, or Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| I need to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| Knox County is in good shape compared to some other counties or other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5469)|
| 1:31:16| but there are other counties and other states that are going bankrupt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| so we may be the best of the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| Does that really make us okay, would be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| And then my third concern would be, we're saying that the county, I'm following up now on Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5486)|
| 1:31:36| the county contribution is like 14%, 15%, or 16%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5496)|
| 1:31:45| We have three plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| The general government plan, basically, those are all retired individuals, generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| so a number as a percentage of pay would really be meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| Similarly with the Board of Education, with respect to the uniformed bodies, UOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| that contribution on the part of the county is 15% of pay currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| and within the end of ten years, 2019, it would be approximately 16% of pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| and that's assuming a 3.5% per year salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| And if I wanted to put that into some well-established industrial organization here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5539)|
| 1:32:28| and take the same salary income of an individual in the uniformed officers plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5548)|
| 1:32:36| or whichever one you're using there, for example, I come from the other end of Gay Street AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5556)|
| 1:32:44| What would AT&T be paying into my pension plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| And maybe that's a rhetorical question, because that's something I've got to go find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| I am retired now, but if I was contributing to my 401K back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5575)|
| 1:33:03| I could pay 6% or 8% or something like that into it, and they would match a certain percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| How does our plan for county employees compare to what we find out on Gay Street here is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5590)|
| 1:33:18| I think that's a discussion that will take place over the next weeks, if not years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| And that is, what is the appropriate level of contribution to a retirement system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| And I think that's for you, gentlemen and ladies, to decide or for the retirement board to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5611)|
| 1:33:39| So I think that's a topic to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| The other, I think, note that you made relative to rate of return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| and, again, the pension board will discuss this topic at length over the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5625)|
| 1:33:53| While the trust fund assets have been able to realize a rate of return of 7.5% over the last ten years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5633)|
| 1:34:00| that has exceeded 7.5%, the actual assumption, can that rate of return be achieved in future years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5640)|
| 1:34:07| Now, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| If we can achieve 7.5%, what degree of risk do we have to assume to achieve 7.5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5650)|
| 1:34:17| With risk, there's volatility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| And is that something that is going to be acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| So I think those are absolutely key questions to be discussed and debated over the coming weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5662)|
| 1:34:31| That's the heart of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| Again, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| I appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| I'd like to move to line item transfers where we do PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| Could we read that into the record and vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| Well, we can do that one really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| We can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| No, because I would like to defer that for at least 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| I've not had time to look at what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| I mean, unless somebody else has a question about it specifically today, I'd like to defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| That's fine if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Commissioner Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| Sorry, I've got a cold still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| We've had a gentleman that's been here two months in a row that wants to speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| and I think deferring it would be not genuine to him in his time that he's waited to be able to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5712)|
| 1:35:21| I think it needs to be we need to discuss this today at least so he can be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| And if we wanted to defer it another month, then we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| But I think we need to extend the right for him to be heard today if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| Commissioner Brown, is that okay with you to go ahead and do what he wants to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| This is just a discussion item anyway, but if we could, let's do line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| So do I hear a motion that we accept the line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| So with the discussion on the purpose scope authority oversight of the public building authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| anyone like to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Anyone like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| Yes, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5765)|
| 1:36:12| Sandy Loy, 813 McKinley Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| I haven't come down here with any particular presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| I'm more or less here just to answer questions if anybody has them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| I've sent all of you all information about a month ago with a package with copies of everything that I found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5784)|
| 1:36:32| and an open records request that I made showing that, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| there were contracts that were awarded on Hardin Valley, which did not go through the public bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5798)|
| 1:36:49| And I don't really know if there are some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| Anybody have any questions they'd like to ask about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| I mean, the ball's pretty much in your guys' court as to what you want to do with all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5815)|
| 1:37:01| I'm here to answer questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5821)|
| 1:37:09| Commissioner Walby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| Yes, Sandy, I've looked over the material that you sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| and I've had several discussions with you as well as other people in the public that has concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5835)|
| 1:37:23| And I guess my scope of it is wanting to know what the scope of the authority the PBA has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5843)|
| 1:37:34| and what you believe, I guess, their scope is, because I'm just coming on the scene on a lot of this and trying to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5854)|
| 1:37:43| But I guess my intention, I understand what the state statute is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5863)|
| 1:37:52| and I know it should have went through a bidding process as far as what Hardin Valley was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| And I know that according to the records that you got, that you supplied to us, there was no bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5879)|
| 1:38:07| A lot of the contracts were issued without even building plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5887)|
| 1:38:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| They interviewed people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| And I know that one of the contracts that I gave all of y'all copies was the one that was written for the mechanical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5899)|
| 1:38:26| and electrical, which was actually issued to be determined in the cost line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| And, you know, my first question I'd like for each of you all to think about is, as many of you have mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| I know that you guys are basically responsible for trying to watch out for the fiscal aspect of our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| is that what value does Knox County get from writing a contract to somebody to be determined on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5924)|
| 1:38:54| The only thing you do when you sign a contract with someone like that is commit the county to doing business with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5934)|
| 1:39:02| for something, for some amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| Now, I can't imagine that we need to be doing business that way at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| You know, the statutory authority is the terminology that's used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| that the PBA has statutory authority to do this and to do that and do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5956)|
| 1:39:23| They've even been in other counties and used that as a sales pitch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| as to why they should be hired by their counties when they're taking work away from our local professional firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| And I'll make it clear, they don't take that work away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| I don't do that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| I'm just bringing that to people's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| But in the architectural firms in town, they are afraid to come up here and say anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| because they're afraid that they'll be blackballed from getting any of the architectural work that still goes through the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5985)|
| 1:39:53| So the architectural community is not happy about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| They're not happy about having work taken away from them in other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| That needs to be stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| The other thing is, is that I don't understand how that we can have one set of rules on this side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6002)|
| 1:40:10| on Gay Street, and another set of rules on the other side of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| If the rules on this side of Gay Street make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| then it would seem common sense to me that they're good on the other side of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| So I don't understand how that you can go to the Andrew Johnson building and put three letters on a door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| and that make you eligible to spend the county's money in a completely different manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| than the county purchasing department is required to follow spending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| I don't know how much clearer to make it than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| You know, we've got rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| We've got regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| They've been there for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| Everybody that's in my business or in the construction business or in architectural business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| understands what public bid means in a public bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| And generally when you go to a public bid, you sit down in a room with your competitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| you hand over a sealed envelope, and it's opened in front of everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| and everybody knows who the low bidder is, and it's for a specific scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| The low bidder that's qualified gets that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| It's just really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| But when you take and allow people to go behind closed doors and, again, I want to reiterate something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6084)|
| 1:41:33| You know, I've built buildings just about every way you can build them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| And design build is a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| There's not a thing in the world wrong with that process, which is basically what happened on Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| And, you know, if Commissioner Andrews wants to build an office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| and he wants to trust me with his money to do that, that's his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| And I would tell him that, you know what, I'd do a great job doing that, just like many of my competitors would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| But that's Mr. Andrews' money and his decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| The point that I'm making with this is that this is public money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| And with public money, and I know the mayor campaigned on this, I know many of you campaigned on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6125)|
| 1:42:12| that transparency is the order of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| And we need to bring transparency back because when we, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| that one contract I mentioned about for the mechanical and electrical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| the original estimate that was on the proposal pages was a little over $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6146)|
| 1:42:38| I'm sorry, the estimates, the budget was $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| The estimate turned in by the people being interviewed, the lowest one was $8.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6164)|
| 1:42:51| They wrote a contract and didn't put $8.4 million in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| They put to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| And then the actual amount that was spent is $9.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| So you went from a little over $7 million to $9.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6181)|
| 1:43:08| And yet, if you ask anybody any questions, they tell you, oh, that project was done under budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| Well, the project wasn't, you know, the budget wasn't even set until the school was about 80% finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6193)|
| 1:43:22| And, you know, and I would ask you, if any of you all build anything, build a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6202)|
| 1:43:29| I mean, who could afford to turn somebody loose and tell them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| when you've got the windows in and you're putting the cabinets in, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| and you're ready to put the carpet down, then would you come and tell me how much it's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| And then I'll write you a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| I mean, I don't think anybody up there would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| I don't think anybody here in the audience would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| But that's the way that our money is being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| And the state statute certainly allows public building authorities a wide range in terms of the way that they can do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6234)|
| 1:44:05| But there's also a state law that also, even though the PBAs are immune from local law, they're not immune to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6245)|
| 1:44:16| There's a state law which clearly says that schools, when using a construction management process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6256)|
| 1:44:24| are to be released on a competitive bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| So while the PBA has a wide swath and a wide latitude on schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6267)|
| 1:44:34| it's my personal opinion that they still should have competitively bid that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6274)|
| 1:44:41| My point to you would be that in the future there needs to be something that keeps this from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6281)|
| 1:44:50| If you go to the PBA's website, go to the organizational chart, the top of the organizational chart is the county and the city mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6290)|
| 1:44:58| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| The county and city mayors appoint the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| I've talked to some of the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| They seem to act like they don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| They pretty much leave it up to the administration of the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| It would be very simple for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| One, I think, that is for the state of Tennessee, the state legislature needs to close the loophole in the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6314)|
| 1:45:22| to where the PBA has to operate under the same rules and regulations as the local purchasing body does for that jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6322)|
| 1:45:32| So if there's a PBA in Sevier County, they ought to work by Sevier County rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| If there's a PBA in Knox County, they ought to work by Knox County rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| They shouldn't be immune to local procurement rules, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| There is legislation at the state legislature now that's being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| I think for that legislation to have much of a chance, it's going to have to have some support from people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6351)|
| 1:45:59| such as yourself, telling them that you do think that it needs to be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6359)|
| 1:46:08| In addition, you've got public building authorities, as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| going into other areas and competing with local businesses, which are tax-paying people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6372)|
| 1:46:21| And that's taking jobs away from your constituents and the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| because those businesses have employees that pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| And they shouldn't be competing with an entity that's funded by government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6390)|
| 1:46:38| John Duncan in the Congress has a bill that is dealing with this on the federal level right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6398)|
| 1:46:48| to stop this from happening on a federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| And I think we need to stop it happening at a local level, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Sandy, I've been reading what you've been talking about this for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| I've read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| I've seen you on TV talking about it and answering questions on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| I appreciate what you're doing, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| What you're doing is not going unheard by people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| And, you know, you've gone up to other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| and you've taken the school superintendent up there and shown him, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| here's what you have built and you can build for different amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| But that's a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| I guess what I want to talk about or ask and tell you and Commissioner Brown with what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| I guess what I want to see is saying, this is so many things going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| Do you want or are you maybe working with Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| We need maybe some bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| Guys, here's where we're missing the boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| We need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| Here's what's gone in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| And here's what we need to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| And here's what I need you guys to check into because there is so much information that you've given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| I think a lot of us are sort of overwhelmed with all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| But we definitely hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| And, Commissioner Brown, that may be some of the stuff that you're going after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| But I'm here to assist you in any way that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| I mean, the bottom line is saving taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| It's saving the taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| And that's what we're charged to do with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| I've not had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Brown about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| I've talked to a few of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| But, you know, I'm not, and I'm trying to make this clear to people in all aspects I'm talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6508)|
| 1:48:36| whether I'm on TV or whether I've been on a couple of radio programs, I'm not on a witch hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| I'm not trying to dismantle PBA or hurt PBA or do anything to anybody in a personal manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6520)|
| 1:48:49| It's just simply that I happen to be somebody that's in this industry and I happen to understand how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| And I know that we can save several millions of dollars if we keep this under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6534)|
| 1:49:02| And also I kind of got, without volunteering to, thrown into the front to be speaking for a lot of the architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6542)|
| 1:49:10| that feel like they can't speak for themselves because they're afraid that there will be retribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6550)|
| 1:49:19| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| First off, the only information I've got from Mr. Loy is what he's mailed to each of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| We've not discussed this, but it's been kind of sticking around in the back of my mind for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6571)|
| 1:49:39| And every time we have something come up, nobody seems to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| It's like PBA is a ghost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| Nobody knows where it came from, what its purpose is, who's getting paid what, where does the money go that they take in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6587)|
| 1:49:58| The information that Dale gave us since the last meeting, I said I've not had time to really go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6598)|
| 1:50:05| That's why I asked maybe to, you know, postpone this at least 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| But I think we need to take a look at some of this and find out where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| Why do we have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| Why is it necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| I know we have to have a building management group, you know, of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6620)|
| 1:50:26| But are these county employees for PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| Are they separate from county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| Are they on the county pensions, county insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| I know that we're using or they're using a lot of the folks in Saratoma for the janitorial services and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6638)|
| 1:50:48| There's so many unanswered questions that I have that I think we need to kind of know what it is and where it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6648)|
| 1:50:56| That was my whole purpose for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| Yeah, I just want to, I'm not against the deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| I just wanted Mr. Lloyd, he's been up here twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| I wanted to be able to, because I wasn't sure if he'd be able to make the next meeting or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| And I just want his statements to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| Yeah, there is a lot of questions that need to be answered that are being asked from citizens to me wanting to know who is this group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| What's their authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| Are they authorized to build buildings, you know, with no bids and all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| And those are questions we need to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| And I'm all for the deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Mr. Lloyd, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| In the future, if you all have any questions, I'll be glad to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| The last thing we have on our agenda is kind of an update on Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| And as I mentioned to you, the Knoxville City Council met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| They feel like that they need to get caught up with where we are in terms of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| They're going to have a workshop April the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| They said they wanted to have that workshop before they considered meeting jointly with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| So I'll bring it up on Monday to give you time to think about how we want to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| Commissioner Norman, do we want to go ahead and do our own thing and not meet with the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| Do we want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| These are just some things that I would ask you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| And that was one of the things that I wanted to offer also as part of this discussion was just see what the will of the body is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6744)|
| 1:52:32| I think that in meeting with people, committees on the task force, it's our desire for us to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6752)|
| 1:52:40| and hopefully allow the commission to take the vote in April at our April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| So hopefully, I mean, from our perspective, but we've done this for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6766)|
| 1:52:52| If we want to put it off more, we don't want to jeopardize anything just based on somebody not having time to go through what they need to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6772)|
| 1:53:01| And so hopefully, we'll talk about it on Monday and we'll make a decision about what we'd like to do workshop-wise then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6781)|
| 1:53:12| The other items that I wanted to bring to you besides my condolences on all the e-mails that you've gotten, I mean, it's just unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6792)|
| 1:53:22| I think I've read them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| I've officially got through every one of the e-mails regarding hillsides this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| And so I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| It's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| And again, I would warn the commissioners that there's still much misinformation and misinterpretation of what the plan actually says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6814)|
| 1:53:43| So be careful when you read what you read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| A lot of emotions still are fogging a little bit of the reasoning ability, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| The website, we have updated the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| And so when you go to noxnpc.org, beside the full plan, you can also get a summary of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6836)|
| 1:54:04| So if you don't want to, you know, some of that sometimes is helpful, or if you want to refer people to summary information, it's available on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6844)|
| 1:54:14| There's also a FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions, and responses to those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6854)|
| 1:54:21| And there is also a place now mapping is available so that individuals could go and use our technology to see if a parcel was inside or outside the proposed hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6861)|
| 1:54:35| So those are all things that are available to you now that were not available to you last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6875)|
| 1:54:43| The other issue that the task force thought might be beneficial, certainly any we're willing to meet, and when I say we, a staff member, like a one-on-one meeting we thought might be a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6883)|
| 1:54:58| or a one-on-two type meeting, some task force members want to be part of meeting with you if you would like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6898)|
| 1:55:05| So you'll be getting a notification from me that says that we are inviting you for a one-on-one discussion of the plan or any part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6905)|
| 1:55:15| any questions that you have about the plan at any time here before the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| So that will be available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| It's just whatever you all would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| So that's about all the information that I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| As Tony enumerated, there's so much indecision and misinformation and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6935)|
| 1:55:44| That's why I asked last month that this be postponed for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| I'm not sure that's going to be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| And I think we should wait until after the council catches up and still meet with them, even if it takes us another 30 days to go through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6950)|
| 1:56:00| because people, I've been dealing with zoning issues for 38 years, and people don't get excited or upset until it touches them next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6960)|
| 1:56:12| They finally were wakened up by the sleeping giant of the chamber with the $8,000, $10,000 worth of ads they ran in adverse publicity to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6972)|
| 1:56:28| So people are now wanting to get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| And I think we owe them the opportunity to get that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| and we can only do that by having some open public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| I agree, Tony, that if any of the commissioners need a one-on-one, I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| But I think there's a lot of JQ public out there that still has a lot of questions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| and that we need to get those answered before we, you know, take a true vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| Has the city asked that we not participate in that April 28th or that they want to do it solo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7018)|
| 1:57:04| They want to do it solo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| I talked to Mr. Bailey, and Mr. Bailey said that in their discussion they feel like they need to get caught up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| so they want to do their own thing on the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| Then they said after that, if we wanted to meet with them and have a joint, they're open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| But on this 28th meeting, they wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| And, of course, they invited us if we wanted to come and be spectators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| But they wanted to have their own meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| I think I'd lean towards what Commissioner Brown said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| I would like to have something with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| And they need, you know, we sat through, what, two three-hour sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| and 98% of it was people coming at us from both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| And I think the city needs to hear that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| But I would lean toward having something joint with them whenever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| Do you have something else, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| I don't have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| I want to do my commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| And Commissioner Norman, anything else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7070)|
| 1:57:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| In response to those, those would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| I think what we need to do is think about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| and take it back up as a discussion item on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| Certainly, I don't see, I see that some meetings like we had before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7083)|
| 1:58:10| are not serving a great interest to us in that a lot of times what we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| are people's misinterpretations of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| What we need is, what we want to emphasize is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| what does the plan actually say and what does it actually do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| And so it's not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| I mean, it's fine to have a public hearing if you want to have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| But a workshop is not a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| A public hearing is a different animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| So I would prefer, I would certainly like for us to stick to the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| not people's interpretations in a workshop setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| So I see some muddled, you know, I see some, I'm wary of a meeting like we had before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7131)|
| 1:58:59| where we have misinformed public entities like we're getting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| The whole of some 60-odd emails from the Realtors Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7144)|
| 1:59:12| is all based on misinformation about 15 to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| So you can take every one of those from the Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| somebody's gone in there and said this is what they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| and every one of them is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| I haven't read one of them that's on target yet about what the plan says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| So that's what we're going to get more of, you know, if we open it up for a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| A public hearing is not a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| And so I want to distinguish between those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| I want to get information to the commissioners that is accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| and on target about the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| That's what I think we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| I don't think we need to hear more interpretations, misinterpretations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| especially of what the plan says and does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| And I definitely don't disagree with Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| but, you know, in terms of confusion, I think that happened on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7204)|
| 2:00:10| I still don't know what a pixel is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| just like I still don't know what 15% is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| So I think both sides, I won't say clouded both of the issues to their advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7216)|
| 2:00:24| but they kind of told a story in a way that either simplified it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| or put it in the best light for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| I want to do what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| I don't want another public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| They're going to come up here and say the same things they always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| Both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| So I don't know how we get that desire, that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7244)|
| 2:00:50| And the workshop, in my mind, is a learning session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| not a PowerPoint presentation, because that, frankly, you know, from NBC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7253)|
| 2:01:00| it told, it skewed a little bit in terms of it could have done more in terms of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| Same thing with the developers and the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| I think the chamber article, it wasn't information, it was an ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| It was an attempt to sway maybe us, probably the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7274)|
| 2:01:21| in a way that was advantageous for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| So I'm trying to be even-handed with this, but it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| And so I don't know how we do what Commissioner Norman wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7290)|
| 2:01:35| I would love for that to happen, and I don't know how, to be quite honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| because whenever you get, you know, you can try to divide the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| like Commissioner Hammond did, give an hour here and an hour there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| You're going to hear what they want you to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| So maybe this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| We're all learning, believe it or not, our, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| Six months ago, we wouldn't be able to have the conversation about slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| and ridges that we can have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| So maybe this whole thing has been beneficial for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| So, you know, I'm leaning toward Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| This isn't, I don't think this is a 30-day issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| It may not be a 60-day issue at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| But I just want to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| I'm not interested in hearing a bunch of pros and cons just hashed about, you know, to and fro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| I'd like to learn a little more and then we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| Well, let me make this suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| You know, in the insurance business, we used to call it the Ben Franklin close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| On one side, you've got what happens now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7350)|
| 2:02:33| On the other side, you've got what happens then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| Maybe that's what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| Okay, here's what we have right now in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| Over here is what it would be under this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| where you can immediately see the differences in if you go right down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7363)|
| 2:02:49| Keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| Rather than have to read 500 pages of something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| put it down here in A, B, C, before and after, and then we can look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| Tony, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| And specifically to both of those comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| one part of the presentation that was not given because of time was where we take examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7390)|
| 2:03:17| We take specific examples, and we run them through the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| We explain we would have time probably to take up the model itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| and there's been criticism of the model and comparisons to Sevier County and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| We take up time to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| Actually, they are addressed in the FAQ section that are on the website, if you'd like to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7415)|
| 2:03:41| But those other issues that need to be addressed, such as this is a plat, this is in the hillside area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7421)|
| 2:03:50| this is what we could do with our plan right now, and if we did nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| if we had the current situation, this is what we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| We've got several examples of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| That was the thing that actually flipped MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| There were six very pro-developer guys on MPC that actually turned on the examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7446)|
| 2:04:13| that Tim Coon presented in a meeting with the MPC, just a sole workshop with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7453)|
| 2:04:20| There was nobody there but the MPC commissioners, the staffers, and some of the task force members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7460)|
| 2:04:28| I think that's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| I think that insulates us from some of the noise in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7469)|
| 2:04:35| and then that combined with opportunities that individuals would have for one-on-one or one-on-two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7475)|
| 2:04:43| I think you're going to be able to air out every question, almost every question that you would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| and if not, we can certainly go longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| This is not a, you know, this three-year thing, we're not, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| we're not going to jeopardize it over a month or two months or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110321?start=7497)|
