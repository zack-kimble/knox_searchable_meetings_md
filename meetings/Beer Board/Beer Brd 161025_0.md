| 0:05:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Briefly, this is at the former Badgett Field, and they've had to do some zoning inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| This is approvable if this is an accessory use, but if it becomes a primary use, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| going to have to go through a rezoning process, and I was wanting to make sure the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| understood and put that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| They spoke to me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| It basically provides for the venue, the sports events, and all that, so nothing to the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=348)|

| 0:06:17| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| We need the building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=381)|

| 0:06:28| Della Vope. Yeah, I just have a question about past stuff. Wasn't one of the Govinos, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| one on Kingston Pike, cited for underage service in the last year or something? Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| That was a different owner than this one. Is that a different owner? Well, no, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| not. I am the same owner. Okay. But you've remediated that issue? Absolutely. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| Thank you. This is a brand new start-up location. It is indeed. Thank you. No problem. All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| thank you. Okay, we did have a motion, right? All those in favor? Aye. All right, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| you, and good luck. Is this going to be the same as the Govinos on Kingston Pike? The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| food and the menu will be the same. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| it. Nox New China on Clinton Highway. Give us your name and address, please. San Qin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=430)|
| 0:07:24| Huang, 5003 Clinton Highway. Okay, Sergeant Hunter. No record. Ms. Dyer. We need the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| from the former owner. Okay, do I hear a motion? Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=451)|
| 0:07:39| Second. All those in favor? Aye. All right, do you know the former owner so you can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| the permit? Well, let's see. The owner is my father. It's a small family ratio. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=463)|
| 0:07:51| Yes, okay. Okay, so when you get that permit, the other permit from your dad, it needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| go to the business office where you submitted this application so that you can get your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| permit. Well, I thought he did yesterday. He prepared all the forms, but apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| he missed it. Okay, all right. All right. Thank you. Thank you. I wonder if she'll tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| us before she leaves a little bit about her restaurant. Oh, it's a Chinese restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| We do mainly carry out. The restaurant's been open for like 25 years. My father's retiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=500)|
| 0:08:28| so he's changing the ownership to my mother, so that's why. Yeah, we had to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| this. Is this the yellow building on Clinton Highway? That's correct. Yeah, it's been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| for ages. Yes, I've been there too. Okay. All right. Thank you. Good luck. Well, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| you. Thank you. Okay, La Bamba, Chapman Highway. Roberto Reyes, and the address is 2619 Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=524)|
| 0:09:02| Highway. Okay, thank you. Sargea Hunter. No record. Ms. Dyer. I need the copy of the sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| tax registration, the certificate of zoning from MPC, and the building inspection and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| health department approvals. Okay, thank you. Do I hear a motion? So moved. Any final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| documentation? Okay. All right. Councilman Pavlis. Yeah, I'd like to know a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| about what this venue, what this is going to be about here. Is it a restaurant, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=565)|
| 0:09:33| a bar, or what? Yes, it's a Mexican restaurant with bar. And I want to open, like, Friday and Saturday, like karaoke and dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=573)|
| 0:09:48| You just want to be open on Friday and Saturday nights? Yeah, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| Okay, what are your hours? I want to open 8 to maybe 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, I don't know. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=595)|
| 0:10:07| Councilman Pavlis, do you have more questions? And then we'll get to Councilman De La Vope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| then Councilman Grieve. Well, you know, I just don't want to be presumptuous, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| mean, it's, you know, that particular address has had a lot of problems there. And are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=619)|
| 0:10:27| familiar with that? You are familiar with the previous problems, and I would hope, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=627)|
| 0:10:35| want to trust that you're not going to follow those footsteps. It concerns me a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| about the hours, but that, I mean, the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, but that's your business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| to run it however you see fit. But there has been a lot of problems there, and I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| that district, and there's a lot of people that are concerned that we'll have reoccurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| problems, but I feel confident in you that we're not going to have those reoccurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| problems, correct? How are you going to work the front door to keep from underage sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=662)|
| 0:11:12| happening there? What? How are you going to manage the bar itself to keep from, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=672)|
| 0:11:21| like underage sales to minors, alcohol to minors? I'll check our IDs, and maybe over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=681)|
| 0:11:34| 9 o'clock, maybe only 21 over, you know. I want to travel with that. Okay. Well, I wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=694)|
| 0:11:46| you the best. I hope you do well there, and I hope it blends in with the rest of the restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| there that, you know, that are law abiding and do the right thing, and I trust that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| will. Counsel Mandela-Vopay. Yeah, thank you. I just got a silly question. I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| to know about the name La Bamba Manisqueria Barbier or something. I don't know. What does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| that mean? It's like more seafood. Okay. So it's not Manis, but it's Maris, see? Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=728)|
| 0:12:16| Maris. Okay. Yeah, okay. Thank you. All right. Did we vote on this? Okay. Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=736)|
| 0:12:24| Yeah, there's been a motion. And a second. Okay. All those in favor, pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| Aye. Aye. Opposed? All right. Thank you. Lempira Mexican Restaurant and Latin Cuisine on Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=749)|
| 0:12:41| Pike. Edward Avila, 8078 Kingston Pike. Okay. Sergeant Hunter. The owner, Ms. Chavez, answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=761)|
| 0:12:56| no to questions 7 and 9 about convictions. She did not disclose several convictions within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| the last 10 years for larceny, conspiracy after the fact, and shoplifting. Okay. Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| Dyer. The file is complete. All right. Mr. Frost, would you like to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| Yes, thank you. Last week when I received from Sergeant Hunter the beer board records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| check, I noticed these convictions. Under the ordinances, Ms. Chavez is ineligible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=803)|
| 0:13:31| a beer permit in that larceny alone is a crime of moral turpitude, and she's prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| from having a beer permit. I guess at this point, you know, the options for the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| the options for the beer board would be to postpone while she attempts to reopen these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| cases and see if she can get them expunged or if she's going to have to be dropped from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| the ownership. Meaning a different applicant would apply for the beer permit? Yes. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=839)|
| 0:14:07| could she be part of the operation? No, no. She has a conviction involving a crime of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=847)|
| 0:14:15| moral turpitude. So if someone else comes in, she can't be part of the business at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| No. Okay, thank you. Can I have a question? Is that something that she answered on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| application or is it shown on her record? Because she would like a copy of that. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| was two places. One, she answered no on her application when the answer should have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| yes. And secondly, when the records check was run, it came back with these crimes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| had been committed in other places. Okay, I'd like to have a copy of that so I can meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| with Officer Hunter. Okay, at the end of this meeting, if we decide to proceed, we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| you that information. Okay, do I hear a motion? Second. I guess I have a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=892)|
| 0:15:07| Mr. Avilar, you're not the applicant, are you? Correct. I just help these clients to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| make sure they have all the paperwork, make sure they're pre-qualified before I bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| them in to the Board to get the applications approved. But the background kind of has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| question on because she just became a permanent resident within the last six months. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| those charges that you're coming from your background, if it's very serious charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| I'm assuming she won't be qualified to be a permanent resident of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| So I would like to really go into deep on the background check, maybe something wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| with the name or the way they run it. Because I know when she came to the office, she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| very limited in English, so I wasn't present when the question or the application she filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| in was completely done right. Mr. Avilar, is the applicant here Ronan J. Chavez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| No, they're not. They're out of their business, correct. So do we typically permit non-applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| to appear without, I mean, I know we allow attorneys, but... No. The applicant needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| to be present tonight. Your name isn't on any of the paperwork. Correct. And so we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| somebody whose name is on the paperwork to be here to speak for the business. And you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| are not that person, unfortunately for you. Well, I did ask that question to Ms. Wanda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| and I was advised. And I've done this before and this is the first time actually you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| have come up with this. And I guess my next question is to the beer board. I mean, historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=989)|
| 0:16:37| when there's multiple applicants on a page and one of them is disqualified, what have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| we done in the past? Have we postponed it to allow them to remove the name? Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| sometimes there's been managers or things. Typically we postpone it to give them an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| to remove the name. But in this case, is this a husband and wife? It is. Okay. She can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1013)|
| 0:17:02| be part of the business unless this is completely cleared up. So what we could do is postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| it for 60 days to give her time to get things straightened out. We could postpone it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| 30 days. And I have a question. Does it mean part of the business is ownership or she can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| participate in operations for the business? She can't participate in the operations or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| be an owner. Okay. Work in the kitchen or anything like that? That is correct. Am I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| right, Mr. Frost? I think she can cook and do things like that, but she can't be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| ownership. She can't be in management. Beer service. Right. And she can't serve beer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| be connected with ordering or anything to do with beer. Okay. Counselor DeLaValle. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| was going to ask Sergeant Hunter just a quick question. I was interested in this thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| maybe they've gotten the name wrong, but do you use fingerprints in order to find these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| prior convictions or is it the name search? How do you do that? This background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| the results that we received was as a result of an FBI fingerprint search. Okay. So these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| results are these records in other states were connected with her fingerprints that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| were taken at the time of arrest. So it's not the spelling of the name or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| It's the thumbprint. That's correct. Actually, some of these, the convictions that I read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| out were actually in other states under different names. Okay. Thank you. All right. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| Grieve. So I was going to say then, if Mr. Lopez is the only owner, then we can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| the beer application, correct? Maybe. I mean, as long as he, is that correct? He's not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1107)|
| 0:18:35| here. No, I know that. But I mean, what I'm saying is it's obvious there's a lot of confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| over this one. And so what I'd like to do is substitute or whatever we call it to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| this for 30 days for clarification. All right. But you've got a motion on the floor. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| we have a motion on the floor to deny. Mr. Wallace. Councilman Wallace. We can postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| it. But I mean, it filled out an application. They answered the questions wrong. She's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| here. And he doesn't, you know, he's just here representing her interests. I mean, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| application would have to start all over. I mean, in my opinion, I think your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| to deny it. You can come back and reapply under another name and everything else. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| right. The motion to postpone would take precedence over the motion to deny. I'll second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| the motion to postpone. Okay. All those in favor of postponing say aye. Aye. Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| No. So we will postpone for 30 days. Okay. Is that satisfactory, Vice Mayor Grieve? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| Okay. Do you want to turn your light off? Thank you. I was going to say that since you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| just relaying information, make sure that the gentleman who's going to be the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| goes through all of the fingerprinting and the background check stuff and the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| so that if he is going to be the applicant, he's ready to go in the 30 days. Yeah, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| did. Okay. I think as far as this LLC, I think we can adjust that legally through the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| and remove her from the application and remove her from the actual contract with the LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| I think it would be just a one sole member LLC because I think the application is under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| the German LLC, DBA, the Imperial Restaurant. So, I mean, that shouldn't take more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| three days to remove her from all the paperwork. Okay. So the next FEAR Board meeting is November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| 22nd. So that will give you about a month to get all of this straightened out and come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| back and then we'll see you again. Okay. We'll just remove her. All right. So we have approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| this until November 22nd. All right. Next is the slice of pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1236)|

| 0:30:30| just wondering, since we started this back, I don't know what. May 24th. In May. May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| does anything have to be renewed in terms of fingerprint checks or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| Sergeant Hunter? I mean, will that be good in January or whenever we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| The only thing that really expires is the task class. The background checks can always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| be redone if it's the will of the board. We can do the background checks today, and somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| can pick up a charge tomorrow. And unless we recheck it, we'd never know. That is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| say, given the length of delay, whether you had any duty to do that. Our typical rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| of thumb is if it's been more than 30 days and somebody submits a subsequent application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| say for a temporary, we have some of the same managers that are on there. If it's been more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| than 30 days, they redo the background check. Okay. Thank you. And the delay has been caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| by what? I got in business with a con man that left town that was my partner. Putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| it on the table. He passed the background, but it was civil, so it wasn't criminal. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| So it's a financial and a structuring of the business that's caused the delays. Right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| because I'm having to have things changed as far as drawings for the city to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| permits and working with a contractor to get the build-out done inside like it's supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| to be. Okay. One of our options is to table this, and in December, if she's closer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| getting this ready to open, then contact Ms. Day, and then we could bring it off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| table. Okay. And that way we would not be dealing with this every two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| I'm sorry. Is the problem you have to have two meetings, one to get it off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| and one to act? You might have to advertise it different. I don't know. Right, but she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| will know in December how close she is. I see. Right. When you get close, get with Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| Day. Yes, sir. By December 1st, if you're going to be ready to open, you think close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| to January, you need to let Ms. Day know so that we can get you on the January agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| Okay. All right. I'll support that motion. All right, so we have a motion to table. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| All those in favor? Aye. All right, thank you, and good luck getting all that straightened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| out. Thank you. Does that mean like if I open January 1st that it would be after I open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| that I would actually have a beer license, though? Well, if you see that you're moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| forward much faster, as soon as you have a pretty firm open date in mind, let Ms. Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| know. In November, if you're sure you'll be ready to have service on January 1st, let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| her know so we can get it on the November agenda to untable it and then hear it in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| Okay. All right. Thank you. Just one more thing. I'd like to recommend that sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| maybe in November, December before you open that you contact the neighborhoods surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| you and inviting them to come in and see what you're doing there. I think it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| be a good idea, especially with the history of what's happened there. So I'd recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| that. All right. Thank you. Keep the fettuccine warm. Okay. All right. Thank you. Next is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| Sunnight Lounge on Marable Pike. Marable Pike. They first applied in December of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2013)|
| 0:33:45| Yes. Sunday tail addresses 247 Andy Carr Avenue, Allcove, Tennessee, 37701. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2025)|
| 0:33:56| So where are we? Right now we are, say, 90% plus in all the angles that need to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2036)|
| 0:34:05| So hopefully I'm shooting for the 18th next month. So hopefully that will work out. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| The 18th of November, all right, three days after my birthday, so hopefully that worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2052)|
| 0:34:20| That would be good. Well, he needs these inspections, so he's ready to go as soon as that part of it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| The task and everything else has been done. Okay, so he just, he has to just get the documentation of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| Right, okay, so we could, so we could actually, do I have a motion to defer this to November 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2072)|
| 0:34:42| So moved. Is there a second? Second. All those in favor? Opposed? Okay, this is an extraordinary amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2082)|
| 0:34:54| that this board has been considering this, almost a year, so please, when you come back, it's been a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| So I can believe that, and so for your birthday present to yourself, please make sure that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| don't have to come back here because these approvals are done and you've picked up your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| All right, I hope so. All right, thank you. Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| Next is the City Lights Bar and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2115)|
| 0:35:29| Margaret Wilton, 438 Black Oak Ridge Road, Seymour, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| Okay. 3865, I am on as site manager, but I've also completed the task. Okay, so tell us, do you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| health, building, and fire inspection? Where are you? We had a pre-fire inspection which showed that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| building needed to bring up its code, so we are working on that. The landlord is aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| the landlord is in agreement of us making the changes to bring it to code. Also, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2159)|
| 0:36:10| the City of Knoxville plans and review, they required two handicap, two separate handicap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| bathrooms, not a joint multi, so we are working on that, and we are hopeful. We are hopeful that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2177)|
| 0:36:30| we will get through plans review with the changes, and again, we do need to resubmit, although we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2190)|
| 0:36:38| submitted plans, so Health Department, due to KUB's grease trap needing a 200-pound grease trap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| we've had to change the plans, so we will be resubmitting to the Health Department, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| the new plans where the kitchen has now changed to the opposite side, so the floor plans have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| changed, so everything is being resubmitted to comply with everybody, to make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| You're making people happy because these are safety requirements, so these plans have been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| place for, I mean, these requirements have been in place for a long time. We are not from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| New York State. We're not in New York anymore. Yes, and see, we were unaware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2236)|
| 0:37:26| occupancy, rental occupancies, usually the building's up to code, you rent the building, then you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| your change of occupancy. We were kind of backwards. We are now navigating Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| and we are now understanding exactly what we need to do. Okay, are you going to have this done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| by November 22nd? We are hopeful. Oh, I don't want to hear hopeful. I want to hear yes, we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| or no, we need this to go to December 20th. Okay, November 22nd. December 20th, if you finish before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2272)|
| 0:38:00| that date, you can pick up your permits from the Business Department, and we won't see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| If you aren't, if we pick a date, either November 22nd or December 20th, and you're not done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| we'll see you again, and we'll ask you these same questions. So you tell me, are you going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2294)|

| 0:38:34| Okay, so December 20th. I'll make the motion to extend it to then. Okay, so we'll extend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| Okay, all those in favor? Aye. All right, good luck, and try to get this done by December 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| You're welcome. All right, we now have two administrative beer hearings. The first is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| Misaka on Kingston Pike, and while the representative is coming forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| they were cited for a sale to a minor on August 2016. They entered into an agreed order with TABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2337)|
| 0:39:06| that included a seven-day suspension. Basically, we're deciding if we want to do anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| or that's enough, and this is in, I think, Vice Mayor Gregg's district. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| Yeah. You have some thoughts? Can we hear about the remediation? Okay, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| let's start with your name and address. Masa Morisawa, 8207 Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2368)|

| 0:39:42| Councilman Dela Lupe will take your question. How long have you had the establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| The business is 23 years. Right, and is this your first defense in 23 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2387)|
| 0:39:55| Second time. Second time in 23 years. Yes. All right, okay, thank you. All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| Councilman Dela Lupe. Yeah, I wonder if you could tell us, sir, just a little bit about what you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| done to make sure it doesn't happen again in terms of a violation, remedial measures you've used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| Yes, we're doing a meeting every week, and also we're using the new system for the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2410)|
| 0:40:20| smartphone, check ID system we do right now. Something electronic that reads the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2420)|
| 0:40:30| I'm sorry? Some electronic device that reads the license and makes sure they're over 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| Yes, yes, yes. We're using the smartphone and the scanner, and then they tell the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2435)|
| 0:40:44| bondage, everything, so. Thank you. Okay, if it's the will of the board, let's let this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2444)|
| 0:40:53| be settled now with their TABC suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| and your new scanner will work, and we'll never see you again for this reason. Don't move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2456)|

| 0:41:37| fine and submitted an remedial plan. That's correct. Okay, this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| Councilman Brown, what do you want to do? Well, they've done everything that they're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| do. Yes. I move to let them continue. Okay, no further action then. Okay, I'm sorry. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2509)|

| 0:42:05| remedial plan here. Have you done all those steps? Yes, we have. Okay, thank you. All right, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2525)|

| 0:42:26| have a beer board workshop scheduled in January. I believe the date's the 13th. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| The 12th. Okay. You know what we're doing? Yes, we are having, after the last meeting when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| very concerned about the number of people selling to underage, I met with Top Shelf and Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| Drug Commission, and they're going to present some ideas for things that we can do and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| that owners can do to avoid that happening in the future. No further business, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161025?start=2570)|
