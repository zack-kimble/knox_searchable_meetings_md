| 0:02:16| scenario, starting to do the transportation needs assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=136)|

| 0:02:47| preferred scenario and to ask questions regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| It deserves more than just a 30-minute discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| at agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=174)|

| 0:03:22| conversations with the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| So those things are subject to change, but that's right on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| calendar as of right now for upcoming City of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=209)|

| 0:03:41| commissioner to planning staff, you're welcome to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=221)|

| 0:03:47| very often, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=227)|

| 0:04:07| technician or two with Donna Hill, who's been our addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| guru for about 25 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| She'll be retiring at the end of June, and so we need to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| someone on board to get her to train to know how to issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=257)|

| 0:04:41| recusing from item number six on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| Jesse, do you want to make a brief presentation on our urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| forestry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| So Knoxville is embarking on its first urban forest master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| This process kicked off mid-December with a big public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| The intention is for it to be adopted by City Council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| result in policy changes and programming to expand and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| protect tree canopy in Knoxville, with an eye towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| possible forestry program expansion into the county as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| So why trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Well, they're a pretty cheap way to provide a lot of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| benefits, and it's even cheaper if you leave them alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| The natural landscape and wildlife here is a big reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| why people come to visit and live here, as we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| There's numerous public health and community benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| The obvious ones are trees clean the air and cool the air, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| they improve water quality by intercepting and soaking up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| stormwater and preventing erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| But there's also studies showing that being in a forested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| environment helps hospital patients heal faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| It lowers your heart rate and blood pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| It's statistically shown to improve your mood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| You're more likely to go out and exercise when you have tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| A tree-lined street slows traffic because it visually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| narrows the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| It also improves the lifespan of pavement because it's less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| exposed to the damages of sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| It's even shown to reduce crime rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| There was a study in Philadelphia showing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| restoring vacant lots with trees and gardens reduced crime and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| increased a sense of public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| So the list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| The goals of the plan are to develop a 20-year roadmap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| supported by three- to five-year achievable benchmarks to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| and protect the tree canopy in Knoxville, identify priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| planting locations for public and private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| These locations will reflect equitable distribution of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| many benefits of trees, tree loss mitigation, habitat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| restoration, and considerations of health and social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| The plan will suggest approaches and incentives for engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| private landowners since 75 percent of the property in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| city is privately owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| The goal is to identify sustainable approaches to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| funding for implementing the plan as well as long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| maintenance and to develop outreach and education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| strategies to promote best management practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Some poor management practices you can see at the bottom is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=431)|

| 0:07:18| liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| There is volcano mulching in the middle there, which is where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| pilot mulch around the base of the tree, which actually causes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| rot and kills the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| And then tree topping is a common practice to manage the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| size of a tree, and it usually just kills it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| The major players are Trees Knoxville, a small but mighty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=458)|

| 0:08:48| This plan is building off the urban tree canopy study that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| was the tract forestry activity in Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| from 2008 to 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| In that time, Knoxville lost over 700 acres of urban tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| canopy in a 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Knox County actually increased tree canopy by a little over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| 500 acres at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Most of that increase came from agricultural land that was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| longer being used for that purpose, which reverted back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| to forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| But as we know, one of the most common rezoning requests we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| in the county is from agricultural to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| residential zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| So this increase has probably changed since 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| This provides a good baseline for seeing where forestry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| activity has been happening as well as trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=572)|

| 0:09:45| it was raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:45| And in phase one, right now we're wrapping up our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| recruitment of advisory group members who will participate in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=590)|

| 0:10:00| Phase two is discovery, understanding where we are and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| where we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=603)|

| 0:10:14| present on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| And there will be an open house in April to get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Then the plan will be drafted and shared publicly for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| and edits in late summer, and it'll be released in the fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| and submitted for adoption by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| There's a website, KnoxvilleTreePlan.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=631)|

| 0:10:56| The mention of Kudzu, is there any, are there any efforts in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| with the city to cut down and cut back on Kudzu or, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| anything to motivate property owners to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| I think that's something this plan would work to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| I don't think there is a formal program to address Kudzu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| I know that there are a lot of volunteer efforts and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| like a weed warrior program, but it's very volunteer led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=682)|

| 0:11:35| Some of them are easier than others, but if anybody wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=695)|

| 0:13:06| There is an RN3 multifamily development just to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| and there are two RN2 subdivisions nearby to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| northeast and the southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| This area has seen some residential infill on parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| that were previously zoned agricultural or industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| as you can see, at the north and southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| The sector plan designates this area as a low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=809)|

| 0:13:46| However, most of it was previously cleared in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=826)|

| 0:13:54| You can see that it looks like it was cleared perhaps for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| agricultural purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| You can also see that these road networks are pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| The parcel does have access to three different roads and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| can see there's precedent for denser residential subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=846)|

| 0:14:21| consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=861)|

| 0:20:43| And staff recommendation is to approve the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1243)|

| 0:20:58| Considering that further commercial development of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| property would most likely be on the eastern side where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1260)|

| 0:21:09| which CA does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| And it also would require a development plan review to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| ensure the highest quality site design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1273)|

| 0:21:21| I do have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| So the folks that live on Cherrybrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| is that the neighborhood bordering it over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| or the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| So, I mean, in planned commercial, there's also some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| pretty heavy landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| There are landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Now, the periphery is specific to building the buildings rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| than like a driveway or parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| But yes, a landscaping plan would be part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| development review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| OK, yeah, I just I think I'd read some comments about some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| of the folks on that street concerned backing up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| commercial as long as there's a mechanism to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| some buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| I know that you said the setbacks and the buffers with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| that, but with some landscaping involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Yeah, landscaping plan would be part of the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1331)|
| 0:22:26| Move on to Whitney Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1346)|

| 0:23:38| west and this is the previous one was with six single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| attached into single family detached homes with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| stormwater heading east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| And the applicant has requested a reduction on the peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| setback from thirty five feet to twenty five along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Jenkins Road frontage lots seven and eight house on lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| seven is existing and that's why we're recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| approval with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1449)|
| 0:24:17| Whitney can you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| What was the reason again for the request for the reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| So one lot seven which is one of the frontage lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| There's an existing house there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| And I do have a quick question about the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Was it was it an issue heading east originally and now they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| changed it is the engineering of that or is that I think there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| was some flooding or maybe it cheated across the road to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| east and they're going to take it all to the west so they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| they'll have to accommodate for that in their detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1494)|
| 0:25:05| Yeah the county commission put on these two additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| conditions in the conversation and that's why I think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| seem to address them from the perspective of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| conversations at the commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1522)|
| 0:25:22| We'll move on to Mike Reynolds for two concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| of development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1528)|
| 0:25:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| With the screen pop up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| The first one we'll talk about is number 21 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Preserve at White's Creek subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| This is on Beverly Road in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| It's actually in the county it's not in the city but it's 196| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| lots with attached and detached structures so it has about 110| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| attached units and then 86 detached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| So in February 20 21 the property was rezoned from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| industrial R.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| which is general residential and flood zone to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| residential up to two point five one dwelling it's breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| Part of the uniqueness of this rezoning case was there's two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| different types of zone classes on the property as plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| residential and F floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| Typically we would remove the F floodway zone from the acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| that can be accounted for density and this the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| discussion during the planning commission and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| commission review was total acreage of site versus only the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| PR zone acreage and during that the applicant asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| specifically 196 slots in the discussion that that turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| into a density for the entire site of two point five one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| dwelling its breaker which is what was given to the PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| So in staff in our opinion the hundred ninety six lots for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| entire acreage is what we're going with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| So was the discussion and approval of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| So I'll flip to another map here in just a moment that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| where the F floodway zone is and try to explain a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| more what typically happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| But just know from our perspective we feel that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| hundred ninety six slots as requested is what was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| through county commission so that there's only one access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| point to Beverly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| They are providing a stub out to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Typically we would request either two access points or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| boulevard entrance through this site to their first internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| We feel what they're proposing meets the intent of what we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| for which is an improved or better entrance way to the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| body of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| The original plan had townhouses that line both sides of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| entrance road with a 26 foot wide road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| What they've done is remove townhouses on the south side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| the entrance road and moved them to the main body of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| subdivision clearing up I guess a clear path through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| entrance road back to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| So from staff perspective we felt better about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| situation with a 26 foot wide road going back to the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| body of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Approximately thirty one point eight of the site percent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| the site will be disturbed and 70 percent of the site will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| but remain in open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| They view on the south side you can kind of see there's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| of topography back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| I'll show you another map here just a moment but they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| to be protecting a good portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| They're going to be under the land disturbance limitations for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| the hillside protection area and they remain essentially out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| of the the floodway area to the north as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| The context wise the site is in the north Knoxville area is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| technically in the county but is pretty well surrounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Beverly Road is in the city so the city engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| will need to be involved with the access point and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| approval of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| You see here that target is just to the southeast Amazon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| facility to the southeast as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| In my report I mentioned that the stub out road to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| would go to McCampbell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| That's the only access point really if a road was ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| McCampbell Drive is not the greatest road in the world so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| wouldn't expect that to be a like a great secondary access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| really more for emergency purposes I would expect if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| ever happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| And to the north is the Beverly Road Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| intersection that is not you know it's not the has a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| delays that could use some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| Beverly Road has an S curve in it and I think I have it in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| image you can kind of see this dashed line how Beverly Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| comes around this this ridge and this does an S turn and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| a railroad tracks in a culvert over the creek here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| So this is approximately at their entrance point looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| north towards the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| It's really have decent you have decent sight distance there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| looking to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| That's where it gets a little bit more concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| They say in their reports that they have sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| they'll have to have that certified during permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| before they can get grading permits for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| So and that'll be based on their designed grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| Just a little closer look at that culvert and railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1872)|
| 0:31:21| crossing that's narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| This going back to site constraints just showing me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| kind of approximately where their entrance point will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| with this red arrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| So the entrance will be out of the floodway and floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| just the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| It does have to come up into the hillside area but they kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| of wrap it around the hillside and bring it back to this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| that is unconstrained by the floodway and floodplain and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| They do get into the hillside a little bit on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| but really the most part they stay out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| There is a condition that they may disturb no more than 12.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| acres of the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Which is what this line disturbance or the site slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| analysis recommends the maximum of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| I think they're in a nine acre range right now with their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| So they'll give them some wiggle room to adjust as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1942)|
| 0:32:32| So going back to the zoning and the floodway zone it's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| of confusing just want to make sure everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| what's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| There is the FEMA floodway which is a regulatory thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| It's outside of our jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| We have to implement those federal standards but it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| a zoning standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| There is the floodway zoning district which is the F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| floodway zone that is actually on the map on the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| and it is a base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| So there's no other zoning underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Basically what the F zone says is you can't really you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| only do open type uses in the F zone parks parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| There is a list of different things agricultural uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| You can't have residential structures in the F zone but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| there are other types of uses that can be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| There is only one little spot in this on this property where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| the F zoning classification extends outside of the 500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| year flood FEMA map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| It's near their entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| They might have a few house lots that extend into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| If they have footprints of houses they'll have to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| them out of the F zone because F zone specifically says you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| cannot have residential structures in the F zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| So there's a condition that was added number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| So you received a blue sheeted staff report for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| That 11th condition deals with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| If they have any house site locations that are in the F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| zone they'll have to move them out either to a new location or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| just kind of adjust the plan as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| So I have to show the F zoning on the design plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| How is the F zone established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| The FEMA maps are updated occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| It's a legacy zoning classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I think it was 84, 1984 maybe, 86, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| So when it was created it was before a county had its current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| stormwater regulations and it was a way to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| the streams and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| But now with the current standards it's really a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| duplication of regulation and the current F zoning class does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| not match the FEMA floodway anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| So there's a mismatch there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Did they take the FEMA flood maps from 1980, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| and just say this is the zone at the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Is that how they made it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| Yeah, they just copied the FEMA floodway over to the F zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| Mike, did I understand you correctly when you said there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| could be a couple of houses planned outside the 500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| or excuse me, inside the 500, but in the floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| There you go, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Then that little red area, they have some house lots that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| be outside of the FEMA 500 floodplain, but within the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| district floodway, that's the actual, with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| So it's really not in the FEMA flood, but you can't build on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Is there, I guess they could seek a rezoning part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| We actually had a similar case on a property, so the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| Zoning Appeals has the authority to approve zoning boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| changes up to 100 feet, and on a different property, the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| of Zoning Appeals did approve a modification to the floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| zone to match the actual FEMA floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| They were totally disconnected, and really, it was a small site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| and they really couldn't do anything if they didn't get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| zoning boundary line corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| So I would suspect that would be the path here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| I don't recall there being a true rezoning of eliminating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| floodway zone through the, like a typical rezoning process going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| through Planning Commission, then the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| There's a separate process called limited rezoning of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| floodway, which maintains the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| It almost creates it like an overlay, but then does provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| a second base zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| So in this case, if somebody, the property owner wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| a limited rezoning of the floodway, it would end up where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| the current floodway is, it would be a PR slash F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| So it would be planned residential and floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| So it's not eliminating the floodway zone, but it's at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| recognizing that there is a separate zoning class there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| has rights as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| They still wouldn't be able to put a residential structure in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| the F zone, but it would clear up the density issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| I'm trying to think of this logically, and I can't come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| that conclusion because...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| It's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Well, I'm not even confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| I'm just trying to logically understand how something out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| the 500-year floodplain could be considered in any, could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2285)|
| 0:38:16| considered a floodway in a zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Well, it's just that the old studied area, that when the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| FEMA flood maps were, I'm not sure how old this is, but when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| it was updated, it corrected where the floodway, the FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| floodway boundary is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| But there was never a process to update the zoning map to match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| the current FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Do we have that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| We've looked into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| It's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| I'll leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| Mike, is that, would that be classified like a letter of map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| revision with FEMA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Well, it's not, they wouldn't have to do like a FEMA map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| The zoning map, floodway zone, the only way to modify that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2343)|
| 0:39:12| either through a rezoning application or, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| the Board of Zoning Appeals has some authority to modify zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| boundary lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| That would be their only path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Because it's not the FEMA floodway that's their concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| It's the, or in this case, what I'm showing, what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| discrepancy is, it's not the FEMA floodway that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| discrepancy, it's the zoning map boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| It's not even a floodway except it's a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| designation floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| It was at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| That's why it was drawn like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2385)|
| 0:39:55| Any additional clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| I know you've received a lot of comments on this over the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2398)|

| 0:40:15| Yes, there has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| And then you're providing a stub out to this larger track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| There is a stub out to the east that they provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| on their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Do they control that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| They do not, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| And does that piece of property have any other access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| Does it have access all the way over the other street that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| said probably isn't desirable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| Yeah, it's under common ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| There's two separate parcels, I think, there that are fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| But, yes, they're under common ownership over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| McCampbell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| So to help county engineering and to help staff, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| it's a little bit of gray area to require somebody to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| something that isn't theirs or even if they don't have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| of what it would be there, I think it would behoove us if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| we're requiring a stub, which makes sense to me, to at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| have them look at their property and draw some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2469)|
| 0:41:18| conclusion about what additional traffic could be handled off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| their intersection improvements just as a basis going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| that at least somebody has looked at it to where we, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| know, somebody comes back and wants to try to look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| staff can say, well, we've got a traffic study here that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| you know, you're probably going to have to or it can't handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| more than five units or ten, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| I mean, it'd just be nice to have them expand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| conversation just a little bit in case these guys are even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| thinking about buying more property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| I'd be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| We can we can look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| It's yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| Chris, does your question relate to the single point or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| It does, because, you know, there may be an expectation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| may be on the fence of doing a diesel lane or a left turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| or some larger improvement down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| There may be a limiting factor of what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| And I think it would it would be nice for these folks to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| because they would they might be the natural person that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| extend into that next property and just keep doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| It'd be good to know on the front end, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| you're really pushing the envelope here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| You're at the yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2563)|
| 0:42:56| Go to the next one, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:43:12| All right, the next one is item number 23, Thompson Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| This was called Thompson Meadows before, just in case you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| confused with a new name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| All right, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| This is out in the Gibbs area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| It was rezoned June 2022 up to PR up to two point nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| billions per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| So this this project does have two access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| It has three to two hundred ninety seven lots that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2620)|
| 0:43:48| broken up into detached and attached dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| It has two phases, so phase one's on the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| so there's a creek that runs through the middle of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| Phase one is going to be on the south side of the creek phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| to be on the north side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| And there is a internal connection being shown here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| that's something that from staff's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| we were we were really pushing them to to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| There is a condition that to provide that that inner that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| internal connection when phase two construction begins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| so it gets built on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| There is also a stub out to Bill Keaton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| That is Jason subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| We at a minimum recommended that they have a pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| connection between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Not sure if there would be a lot of traffic that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| Go that direction if there if there actually was a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| connection, it really wouldn't save anybody much time by just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| going up the Thompson School Road at their main entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| So having another connection point there would have benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| But at the same time, we felt that the pedestrian connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| was the main point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| And I'll show you why in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:21| So contextually, so Thompson School Road is is on the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| side of their property and it kind of loops down and connects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| into Emory Road and then there's Tazewell Pike off to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| and this is Tazewell Pike going north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| The Gibbs schools are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| I'd point out Carnes Drive only because it is a cut through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| road and it's very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| There's been a lot of complaints about traffic on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| We've looked county has looked at different options to him and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| what to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| That one is still an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| We're kind of in a impasse, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| I'm at the point I'm not sure if there's anything in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| But what I want to show also is the future pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| connection that the county and the planning department have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| been working on as properties have been developing or at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| least getting approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| So the purple line is kind of the pedestrian path that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| somebody on Thompson School Road would take to get to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| The county is installing a sidewalk along Thompson School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| Road to the Edwards Place subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| There are sidewalks in Edwards Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| That would take you to another connection point to what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| called Twin Oaks subdivision, which has not started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| construction yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| That then would get you over to the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| So ultimately, through the adjacent subdivision with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| pedestrian connection, there would be a path that would get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| you to the sidewalk system, get all the way over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2822)|
| 0:47:02| So that's the main point that we're concerned about is make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| sure that pedestrian connection stays open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| Just wanted to show you what we were thinking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| Bill Keaton Drive is the one that I was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| the stub out connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| This, see here, it's pretty, it would be an easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| connection to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| This is the road that goes to the south from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| If you had either vehicle traffic or pedestrian traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| this is the route they would take to go to the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| system or to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Unfortunately, this subdivision doesn't have sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| in it, so it would be an on-street walking situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| Hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| So the whole northern, well, a good portion of the phase two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| part of this property is in the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| The most northern part really won't be disturbed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Their construction stays to the south of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| This is kind of the top of the hill and it falls off to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| again, to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| I don't suspect, I do not anticipate any of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| being disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2888)|
| 0:48:08| And if they even leave a little bit of the rest of this alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| they will meet the slope analysis recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| for land disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| So I don't have any concerns that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| going to meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| The FEMA floodway you can kind of see here on Clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| Springs Creek, only as into a small portion of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| They do have a little bit of encroachment into the 500 year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| but they don't really, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| they stay out of it on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| I'm going to go back to the plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| There's a, I mentioned that there's a mix of attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| and detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| So on the south side, the attached units line the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| ring of this loop road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| And then on the north side, it's predominantly on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| cul-de-sac road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Then on the south side of the northern portion of this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| it kind of loops around to the north side there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| So just to give you an idea of where their attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| units are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| And this project does have quite a few variances in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Most of them are pretty common requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| Minimal reductions of a vertical curve or horizontal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| curves reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| So, like for instance, a horizontal curve in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| little U here are 100 foot radiuses each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| but because of the location, we're not talking about fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| carving, fast driving cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| And the other part where they have quite a few 100 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| reductions are in this road D, where they have these little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| kind of reverse curves happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| but they're really short ones that help reduce travel speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| And it's not a long sweeping curve, so it's not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| create sight distance issues or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| So staff is recommending approval of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| If anybody has questions, I'll be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| We'll move on to the last item for discussion, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3019)|
| 0:50:33| Commissioner Higgins, I presume you're recusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| yourself from this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| I was thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| I think maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| But then on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| OK, so this proposal is for an adopted reuse of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3049)|
| 0:51:10| former Galbraith School building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| It's located near Baker Creek Preserve, just south of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| East Moody becomes Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| It's just adjacent to South Oil Middle School property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| which is basically all these empty parcels here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Of course, the main one and then these few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| empty parcels along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| Sector plan and one year plan both have it designated as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| civic institutional and it is zoned R in one, which does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| typically allow multifamily developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| So this proposal is to convert the school into a multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| property or building and then add an additional building for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| up to seventy five dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| So looking at the context of the site, it's predominantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| single family to the southwest of Galbraith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| The school occupies a big portion on the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| side of Galbraith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| And just looking a little bit more at the site, you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| the additional building kind of makes a U shape and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| there's this empty space here where the new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| would be is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| And again, just kind of looking again at the site, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| where the building would connect here at this blank wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| that you can see better images of in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| And then the topography of the site, it is sits on a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| level here where the building is and then it kind of tapers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| down into this this little area here, which you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| better from street view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| So the proposed building would sit at a lower floor elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| than what the the original building does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Looking at existing buildings again, this is kind of an image| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| you can see how much higher it is from the street view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| So there's a retaining wall in the existing structure, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| is in various states of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| And again, that's a better shot of that blank facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| that would be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| So the site plan goes into the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| I'm just going to give you a little bit of highlights along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| here on this next to Decatur, there's some fitness equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| that would be proposed, some community gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| along this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| They are also improving stormwater infrastructure and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| they're moving in the parking, the bulk of the parking to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| rear of the site and then scooting over the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| parking to the east of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| And there's one provision in the airport of the benefits is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| also that they're going to be grading a corner and that's to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| improve this corner site visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| You can see if you're sitting here at the stoplight back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| this area, you kind of have a hard time seeing around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| And so they're proposing to grade this corner to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| that site visibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| And this is just a better view of the site plan, which kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| shows the landscaping that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| So there's a 10 foot class A buffer that's required between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| multifamily and single family residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| And so that's been proposed along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| And they are requesting a number of exceptions in order to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| this happen and there are in one zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| So they're proposing to add as permitted uses multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| independent living facility, live work and residential care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| And as a special use, they're requesting to add the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| office land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| The other zones, the residential zones that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| multifamily have a minimum square footage per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| So they're adding that they're proposing the same as are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| five, which is fourteen hundred and fifty square foot per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| dwelling acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| They're proposing to increase the maximum building height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| from forty five feet from thirty five and are in one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| which is in line with what is allowed and are in for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| The maximum building coverage would be increased from 30 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| 50 percent, again, aligned with our four and above, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| maximum impervious surface would be 70 percent, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| in line with our and six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| Other zoning exceptions that they're asking for is to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| the 15 percent cap on the use of aluminum, steel or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| other metal sightings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| And they're also requesting to have an exception from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| requirement in our and one that only one primary structure be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| located on the site for the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| There is right now a provision that you can get a 30 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| parking reduction if your site is within one quarter mile of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| transit route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| And so they're proposing to have a lesser reduction because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| they're a greater distance from the transit route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| So they're asking for 15 percent because they're one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| third of a mile from a transit route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| And there's more information on the transit route and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| like that within your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| So the plans do make a reference to the National Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| Service standards for historic structures, the rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| and that that website refers you to the secretary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| interior standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| I'm happy to send this to you guys if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| But there's a list of things that they recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| The one that's referenced is number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| It says new additions, exterior alterations or related new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| construction shall not destroy historic materials that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| characterize the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| The new work shall be differentiated from the old and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| shall be compatible with the massing size, scale and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| architectural features to protect the historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| integrity of the property and its environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| So that's the one that they're referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| I just wanted to give you guys some context on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| That's one of the basis that they're requesting to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| material or remove that cap on the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| That's the aluminum and metal and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| So we are recommending approval of all the exceptions with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| exception of the materials where we do believe that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| still be should still be a cap on that to remove that entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| kind of gets away from the intent, which is for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| materials to be more of a trim, more of a decorative element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| and not the entire structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| And while it's not the intent of this particular applicant to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| this to make the entire structure of metal, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| permissible and kind of sets a precedent for allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| So we are proposing a cap of 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| That's a 10 percent increase over the 15 that's currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| allowed in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| So other than that, we're recommending approval of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| the exceptions and all the reasoning and all that is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| your staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| I'm happy to answer any questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Can you go back to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| Yeah, that one for the maximum building height, the there's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| current structure, the historic structure, and there's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| that's being proposed to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| What's the current height of the historic structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3446)|
| 0:57:26| Is it the reason that that needs to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| So I'm not sure exactly what the height of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| structure is, but I know that because the floor elevation on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| the new proposed building is lower, it can be to it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| an additional story and still be roughly proportional to what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| existing right there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| So it would be similar to what's outside appearance would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Yes, we've discussed that with the applicant and that was what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| we yes, they were in agreement that it would be around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| same and that's due to that floor elevation being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| so much lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3479)|
| 0:58:12| Any questions or any other agenda items you want to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| up or staff to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| I hope this is an indication of how the meeting will go Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3498)|
| 0:58:26| Don't say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| I can get away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Tim can't say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| We do have a executive committee meeting here immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230207-agenda-review?start=3516)|
