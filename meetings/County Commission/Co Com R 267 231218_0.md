| 0:02:20| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| We appreciate very much you all coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Our next item on the agenda is a devotional, and I'll turn it over to Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| We all come from various backgrounds and beliefs, but I would like to take a moment of personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| privilege and share with you all what the Christmas story means to me as someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| puts faith and trust in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ through his birth, his death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| on the cross, and his subsequent resurrection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| For me, the good news of Christmas is that even when the world or our circumstances change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| the message that God sent his son Jesus to give us hope, love, and joy never changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| When there's so much bad news and devastation in the world, this is good news worth celebrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| I've come to believe that the story of Christmas is one of profound courage, more specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| courage for the sake of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| This is so brilliantly evident in the way in which God orchestrated the way Jesus came to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=204)|
| 0:03:31| Mary, a young virgin woman, would experience great fear, rejection from her family, friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| and community, and the pain of watching her son endure a lifetime of immense persecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=218)|
| 0:03:46| But Mary would demonstrate incredible strength and courage for the sake of her love for God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| for her son, and for fellow man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Joseph, known as a righteous and considerate man, was called to question and his character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| and integrity scrutinized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| But somehow, he found the courage to protect a wife, father a child, all for the sake of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| And Jesus, never before or after has any man suffered the full range of hardships of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| life in a fallen world, all for the sake of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| Then my Lord, Jesus Christ, hunger, homelessness, rejection, sadness, grief, betrayal, mockery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=265)|
| 0:04:37| violence, misrepresentation, physical torment, and death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| He came and endured all these things so that those who would accept him as their savior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| would have what could never be earned or achieved on our own, courageously for the sake of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=291)|
| 0:04:59| So this Christmas, may love come alive within you, may hope fill the room around you, may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| peace go before you, and may the courage of Christ never leave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=311)|

| 0:05:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=354)|

| 0:06:03| leader in our community who passed away last week, Dr. Clarence Sexton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| Not only was he an unbelievable man of faith, but he just had an immense love for this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=376)|

| 0:06:25| that can replace him at this time, but he just, he was just terrific to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| And I was just wondering if we could just, if this body could take a moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=393)|

| 0:23:23| It's been done by the volunteers, the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| It's been done by the donors, the folks who continue to believe and give how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| can give to this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1411)|

| 0:23:39| very, very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1419)|

| 0:23:47| non-existent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1427)|

| 0:24:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1452)|

| 0:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| We now move into public forum for agenda items only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| Is there a John Farber here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| He had signed up actually for zoning items, so I was not sure if he knew that we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| start zoning until 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| The other speaker we have signed up is Constance Everly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| Everly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| My name is Constance Everly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| And I understand you signed up to speak on two agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| Six and 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Number six and number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| You'll have three minutes to speak on each item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| If you give your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Can you scroll to the agenda item, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1526)|
| 0:25:51| Set that for three minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1551)|
| 0:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| You may begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Constance Everly, Knox County residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| So the concern that we have here is obviously that we are taking in funding for special needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| education of students, which is great, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| We need to definitely fund that initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| But, again, as always, it doesn't seem to matter if it's the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Nobody ever addresses the elephant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| I'm sure you are now at this point seeing the Knoxville News Sentinel story of the parent who had a four-year-old child who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| broke crowns and was stuffed in a closet as some form of mediation of discipline for his behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| This is problematic because you know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| He is a special needs student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| And the irony is that as I continue to talk about this, see, people have to understand how government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| The money is the control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Whoever holds the purse strings has all the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| And so you all should be using these roles with your economical accessibility as your stronghold and leverage for accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| I cannot begin to understand why anyone who claims to be an adult or, for that matter, even a parent, whether you're a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| professional teacher or you drive a school bus or you work in the cafeteria, cannot seem to understand that a four-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| child does not deserve to be stuffed in a closet for breaking crowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Shout out to Brian Horvath who reminded me that broken crowns steal color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| So what was the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| And more importantly, what was the professionalism in how we addressed the concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| Because we know from the Knoxville News Sentinel story, the mother did reach out to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| The mother did reach out to representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| And the irony is that, as always, the typical form of cowardice, no response, nothing, not a single explanation on why her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| child was stuffed in a closet, left by herself, crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| And when he gets asked by his own mother, how does he feel, what is wrong, he tells her, I feel trapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| See, this is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| This is why we have the prison school pipeline happening in the first place, because we have white educators who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| unfamiliar how to deal with black children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| And the first thing you all see is criminalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| And this is a form of torture and treatment to our children because you are unrelatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| Data shows and proves that children perform better when the educator looks like them, lives like them, and comes from the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| demographic of community and living lifestyle of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| But see, Nassau, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Now, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Part of the reason why you can't do that is because you closed Nassau College, which is one of our pillars of bringing black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| teachers into our schools in Knoxville in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| Shout out to my area of education because we got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| But the future generations are not getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| But let's keep it real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| I can't expect much from a council that murders children in high school for guns in the first place because you sure didn't kill the kids in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| You sure didn't kill the kids at Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| And I know for a fact the Rue King killer who did kill someone who was a teenager himself is still alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| So let's keep it real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| What I know I'm asking for is extremely outside of the bounds of what you all really, quote, unquote, will be able to do because you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| give a damn in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| Next item, item 12, if you'd find that, please, on the overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1737)|
| 0:29:09| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| So, yes, this initiative, again, we definitely going to need some mental health services for these cops running around in our city, in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| Knox County community because, again, the elephant in the room, the Starbucks employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| You know, it's ironic that police officers can lie under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| They can write a whole police report, say whatever happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| We've got body cams, a dash cam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| But we've got all this evidence today that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| And how ironic that you all sit there and write lying reports on this man who was really doing his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| I mean, he was they were on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Starbucks does not want their drive to jammed up because Starbucks makes millions of dollars per minute, per hour, per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| So I am at the Starbucks Corporation for telling employees clear the parking lot because we're making money over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| But the irony is that this man was assaulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| He was beat up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| He was charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1796)|

| 0:30:02| And then the audacity of Knox County Sheriff Department to sit up here when I saw what a couple of weeks ago, Tom Standenberg begging for money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| literally, and you all gave it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| And then we have this incident come out publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| Shout out to Representative Sam McKenzie, who applied the necessary pressure and said, release the body cam footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| We don't care what the cops say because we know they're liars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| What we do want to see is what the evidence will show us, which is that they assaulted this man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| And how ironic the charges were literally dropped as soon as that request for the tape to go public came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| But my next question is, where are the charges for the cops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| Where are the charges for the officers who lied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Where's the charges for the officers who beat him up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1837)|

| 0:30:51| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| But, you know, the irony is that we know that their officers are unfit for duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| We have officers committing murder, suicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| How about we be sure to address this mental health concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| You know, there are so many things that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| See, I'm a military person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Military takes you through what's called a fit for service, a fit for duty evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| And you go through that twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| It's mental and it's physical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| And the audacity is that you all will hire a high schooler, 18 years old, give him a gun and somehow think that this is a person fit for duty when we know by, again, by the science that most teenagers are not even mentally capable of being adult trained individuals until 25 to 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1872)|
| 0:31:28| But, again, what am I really expecting from a city and a county who has shown the lack of care and consideration and, more importantly, the necessity of accountability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1888)|
| 0:31:38| And, again, I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231218?start=1898)|
