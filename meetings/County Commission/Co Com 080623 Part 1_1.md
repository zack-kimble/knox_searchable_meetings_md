| 2:16:35| it's also the location of an operation known as the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| And in that facility, we have the city of police, Knoxville City Police has a presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| I think maybe even the district attorney has a presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| Our probation pre-trial office has a presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| The only paying tenant right now is the Department of Human Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:59| Yes, Mr. Arms, but as I understood when we spoke to Ms. Dilworth with regards to the Family Justice Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8219)|
| 2:17:06| she said one of the reasons why they had such cooperation from other partners was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| because they provided the infrastructure for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| So I understood it that they would not be charged a cost, that they would not be charged rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| that that was part of the agreement with having those groups there in the Family Justice Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8238)|
| 2:17:23| was that was an incentive to have those groups there, was that they would the infrastructure was provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8243)|
| 2:17:28| So I'm a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| Are we going to start charging them rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| We're not charging that organization rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| But we will look for, well, indirectly everyone in there is somehow, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| if our probation pre-trial location is over there, they will be paying a small percent of that rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| But we're also looking for other nonprofits to move in that facility to help pay the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8268)|
| 2:17:56| I don't think we should be charging them rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| But this is a classic example of what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| You go receive a significant federal grant to make something very important happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| When the federal grant money runs out, someone has to pay the light bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| Well, as I understood, the $45 that we would be collecting, that $3 was going to go to the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8291)|
| 2:18:19| and the other $42 was going to pay for the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| And that's a long way from $187,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| Back on this one other quick piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| I'm sorry, but where is it budgeted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| Under what department or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| Part of it will be in the PBA's management fee, which, of course, Knox County pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| So it's just going to be divided up amongst every little department included in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| That $187,000 will be cut up into little pieces all across the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| If we can get other people in there to pay rent, the more paying tenants we have, the smaller that piece will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8335)|
| 2:19:02| And we will look for other paying tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| Back on this piece with KCDC, because KCDC receives federal grant money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8345)|
| 2:19:11| they're required by HUD and other federal agencies to distribute their overhead appropriately over every facility they manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8351)|
| 2:19:24| So when KCDC was managing that property, it cost us significantly more than us taking that piece of property back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8364)|
| 2:19:32| and us managing our sales because they're required to distribute their overhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| just like a Department of Energy contract, for instance, is distributing overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| But the important point to realize is when we pass that over to KCDC, the only person they can pass that back to is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8380)|
| 2:19:49| So, for instance, if the old South Knoxville High School, instead of it being sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| if KCDC had entered a proposal where they would take that over for a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8393)|
| 2:19:58| and try to turn it into senior housing or something, at some point in time that didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8398)|
| 2:20:02| The only place they could pass that back to is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| So when we realized that the KCDC management and maintenance of that building was more than we could financially bear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8406)|
| 2:20:15| we worked with them for them to pass that building back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:18| We're the only person who could pass that building back to is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| So what you're saying is we're going to save money on this deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| We're going to save money versus KCDC managing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| But still, in the long run, we need more folks paying rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| And that's something we'll be working on after July 1 when we take the building back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8431)|
| 2:20:36| But that building, I think Commissioner Strickland, who's visited that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| it's in much better shape than it was a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| It's been modernized, upgraded, actually an outstanding structure now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8443)|
| 2:20:49| which, of course, that saves us in the long run in maintenance and cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8449)|
| 2:20:56| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| Yeah, Mike, let's get back to the $42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| As I understood it, that's why we approved this collection from the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8460)|
| 2:21:06| I think like any crime over $500 or something, they would be assessed this additional fee to the courts of $45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:14| And like Commissioner Davis said, three of it goes to the clerk, the rest of it's going to go to the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:21| So what's that money going to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| And you say it's not a lot of money, but we don't know yet what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| Well, the Family Justice Center has staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| The federal dollars have run out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| That was a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8494)|
| 2:21:35| Well, no, the federal dollars don't run out, as I understand it, until the end of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| They're winding down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| No, they've got a year left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| It's like the one everyone can relate to, these federal grants where they give a city X amount of money to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8503)|
| 2:21:51| and hire ten new police officers, and ten years later, you know, that winds down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| and suddenly those ten officers at some point in time becomes local government's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| That's what we're looking at, a way to keep this program viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| I understand the program needs to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| But, you know, as I got a call Friday from a city official saying that cat service to halls is going to be cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8527)|
| 2:22:15| possibly because, you know, they just don't have the money, and it was a burden on the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| It was like they were doing us a favor of running out into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| So now we're picking up all the cost, and a lot of these are city functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| The KPD is going to be there in some role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| Are they paying anything toward the cost of operating the Family Justice Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8551)|
| 2:22:37| I'm not sure I can find out what city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:41| Well, you know, Mike, are they working with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8561)|
| 2:22:45| Have you all worked a budget with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| I mean, are they going to give us money or they're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| I mean, surely somebody knows that question before we take over a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| Well, the building is, like I said, we've got the building and we've got the organization within the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8576)|
| 2:23:03| So if the Family Justice Center organization completely went away, we've still got that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:12| And the more paying tenants we can put in that building, the better it is for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8592)|
| 2:23:18| Do you have any tenants lined up right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| I know you had Section 8 housing over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| Are they staying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8605)|
| 2:23:31| The state's the only one now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| What about Section 8 housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| I know they're over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| I'll go over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| I don't think they're paying rent now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| Are they wanting to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| Remember, the Family Justice Center solution is to have a place for battered women to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8621)|
| 2:23:49| almost like the term one-stop shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| So when they go there, it's a safe house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| And all the resources they need to become viable again, whether it's police or sheriff's protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8635)|
| 2:24:02| or helping them get a job or helping them get housing is there located in that one shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8648)|
| 2:24:09| But if it's going to be a shop that's going to represent all of Knox, Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| then you'd think Knoxville would be willing to pay a portion of keeping it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8653)|
| 2:24:18| And I don't know if you all have had that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| The city of Knoxville, I think Police Chief Owens is on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| We'll have that discussion at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| And that's the budget of the operation itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| But the building itself is being passed over to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| The $187,000, is that the total cost of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| That's the total cost to maintain the building, which is security, utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8677)|
| 2:24:46| And that's Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| Nobody else paying anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| That's Knox County money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| We're paying that through PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| Yeah, but without help from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8696)|
| 2:24:57| I don't know how much money the city is putting into the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| Well, since we don't know the answers to a lot of things, maybe we need to defer it 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| and see if you all can come up with some answers to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:16| I'd just like to make a motion to defer this 30 days and maybe the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:20| could get some answers on who's going to be there, what tenants are going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| And I know there are several people over there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| Are they going to be remaining and staying for free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| Are they going to be charged rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| I guess here, I'm not saying not delay this 30 days, but here's the facts of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:38| If the sheriff moved out and the police moved out and the Section 8 housing people moved out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| the Family Justice Center would fall apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| Then you just have a place for women to show up who have been beat up, and we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| well, you know, hit the street and find somewhere else to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| I mean, this is a solution, and just like any other solution, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8751)|
| 2:25:57| the more people contributing money, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| But right now, the people there are not contributing money, and over the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8759)|
| 2:26:03| as the building has been passed back to us in ownership, we'll try to put together a funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| solution to make the Family Justice Center work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8769)|
| 2:26:13| But we went out as a community to receive this federal grant to set up the Family Justice Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:17| and now we've got to find local funds and local revenues to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8777)|
| 2:26:22| So if the Section 8 housing people said we don't want to pay rent, we're moving out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| then that's just a piece of this solution that's gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| So you're saying if they say they didn't want to pay rent but they would stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| then that would make the deal better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| Make the deal better for these battered women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| But I guess what we're looking at now, and I'm trying to separate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| I completely understand where you're coming from on this organization of the Family Justice Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8801)|
| 2:26:47| how we fund that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| But what we're talking about today is the building that they're going to reside in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| and the fact that KCDC is passing the ownership of that building back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| So we're taking ownership of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| Well, this is where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| Which is a building that Knox County originally owned and has now been modernized and upgraded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8820)|
| 2:27:06| through some federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| Well, this is where I'm having a problem getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| It's just like this building right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| It's not owned by Knox County or the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| It's a joint partnership, I guess, and PBA actually owns the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| I assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| Well, we'll just assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| Since we don't know, we'll assume that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| Why don't we assume that we go the same direction on the Family Justice Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:34| and let PBA be the owner with a joint city and county cooperation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| sharing the costs like we do at this building right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8859)|
| 2:27:44| If that's, in fact, what we do, we'll just assume we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| And what we need to do is go to the board of this Family Justice Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| and say we need a more equitable distribution of how you're going to operate this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| I think Mr. Troyer said on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| I know probably there's more city and Knoxville officials on that board than the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| I certainly understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| I think the mission you're saying is the city needs to be paying more of the share of the operation of this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:16| I think we ought to pay our fair shares, whatever that needs to be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8896)|
| 2:28:20| But I made a substitute motion that we defer it 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| and maybe that can be some discussion instead of us approving something on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:27| and then trying to get money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8907)|
| 2:28:28| That makes it a lot harder to work a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| Can we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| Are there any questions to the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8923)|
| 2:28:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8924)|
| 2:28:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| Who are the noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:56| Motion passes 17-16-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8936)|
| 2:29:12| To defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| To defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| 9-0-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| 9-0-3 is approving an amendment to Knox County contract number 0-2-324 as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8961)|
| 2:29:28| with the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation extending the contract term through June 30, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8968)|
| 2:29:36| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| Vote at 8-1, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to the motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| All of us should have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8990)|
| 2:29:51| It's on this orange paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| In effect, it says we will renegotiate this contract so the hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| shall be set at the state minimum of 40 percent to the contract recipient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=8998)|
| 2:30:03| The resulting savings split evenly among 18 tourism visitor-related groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| and they are listed on the sheet in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| So I would make that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9013)|
| 2:30:18| Do we have Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| You know, if this commission wants to cut it down from 45 to 40 percent, certainly that's one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:30| The other issue is who came up with the 18 other organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| and did we already award them grants through the grant process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9033)|
| 2:30:39| Some received, some did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| I took the names from those who presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| and all of them had received less than they requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9046)|
| 2:30:49| and all of them are tourism-related and that's why I pulled them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9052)|
| 2:30:53| Are there any more tourism non-profits out there that could use more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| There may well possibly be, but these were the ones who came before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| and I thought this would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| You know, I think we need to divide the question if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| If the commission wants to cut it down, like I said, that's one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9070)|
| 2:31:13| but I don't know that we need to just today give 18 other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9073)|
| 2:31:18| split the remaining five percent between them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| I mean, I think that's something we need to work out and see what organizations best benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9081)|
| 2:31:26| and best return the value to Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9086)|
| 2:31:32| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| If I remember correctly the other day, didn't we fund a DVX| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9094)|
| 2:31:38| and also the Knoxville Opera Company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| They had requested $100,000, but they received $71,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| and last year they had gotten only $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| So I feel like, and the Coomba Festival got, was it $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| They got $25,000 and then how much did DVX get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| Was it $25,000 as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| Was it $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9117)|
| 2:31:58| And they asked for what, $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9120)|
| 2:32:03| Now some of these, like James White Fort received absolutely nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| so I think that they need to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9126)|
| 2:32:08| But I believe that the Knoxville Opera Company received more than what they had requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9128)|
| 2:32:14| from prior years and I think some of those need to be not included on this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| since we did fund them, as Commissioner Moore said the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| I think the ones that received no funding whatsoever should get priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9144)|
| 2:32:29| if that's what the commission chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| Yeah, I'd like to hear from Gloria Ray and see what her opinion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9159)|
| 2:32:40| My opinion is pretty much the same as it was at the last two or three meetings that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9160)|
| 2:32:45| I'm going to try once again in terms of it may be that history and results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9165)|
| 2:32:50| may be, I think, the information that may sway the vote one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9170)|
| 2:32:55| The history is that when Tommy Shumpert was the county executive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9175)|
| 2:33:00| Frank Leuthold was the chairman of the finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9180)|
| 2:33:03| Wanda Moody was chair of the subcommittee of the finance committee that looked at just hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9183)|
| 2:33:09| and motel tax allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| After many years of hearing similar to the request that you all heard on the day where you heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9191)|
| 2:33:18| from 70 or something organizations, they, too, went through that same process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9198)|
| 2:33:23| and found it was very difficult to compare what someone's doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9203)|
| 2:33:28| and compare to what someone's doing there in terms of where the source of funds should come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| So as a result of that, Commissioner Moody and her subcommittee came up with a three-page questionnaire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9213)|
| 2:33:40| that each organization that was requesting funding from the hotel-motel tax were required to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9220)|
| 2:33:46| At the end of that exercise or process, shall we say, many of the organizations realized on their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9226)|
| 2:33:53| that, in fact, while they serviced tourists that would come into town, they, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| were not organizations that were charged with the responsibility of getting tourists to come to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:05| The questions would be like, show me your brochure that you distribute across the country or regionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9245)|
| 2:34:11| to try and get people to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| What's the distribution amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| How many did you print?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| Where's the video?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| Where's the advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| Who wakes up or how many people on your staff wake up every morning to try and get people to come to town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:25| What they concluded by the end of all that is, in reality, what I spoke to the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| which put me in a very awkward position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| I'm not speaking against any of these organizations that we mentioned here and some others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9272)|
| 2:34:38| But they are, in fact, the ones that's the experience that we go out and market and sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9278)|
| 2:34:43| The contract of which we are speaking is a contract with Knox County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| to market all the assets of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| And we take those as a group and package them and sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| While Keep Knoxville Beautiful is a wonderful organization, and I sure don't want Mary Lou Horner mad at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9295)|
| 2:35:01| I would challenge to say I don't think that any of their staff or their board thinks of ways to get people to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9301)|
| 2:35:09| Is it important that Knoxville and Knox County be beautiful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9309)|
| 2:35:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9313)|
| 2:35:14| But after this exercise and after this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| it was at that time that County Executive Schumpert moved those organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| which truly were not tourist-related in terms of tourist growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| moved them to the community grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9326)|
| 2:35:30| And that was when the movement took place because what we were talking about was the 10 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9330)|
| 2:35:36| that was allocated from Hotel Motel Tax to go to organizations that's job is to grow tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9336)|
| 2:35:44| As a result of that, as I shared with you before, of that 10 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| eight percent of it went to the Knoxville Sports Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| whose sole job was not to do local events, not to do anything other than to have events that brought people from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9352)|
| 2:36:00| So by combining the two, which we did several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9360)|
| 2:36:03| we reduced that to a total of 45 percent as a result as opposed to 48 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:10| What you're saying now is then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| does the sports corp need to get back in business and come before this committee and again say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9373)|
| 2:36:18| put our numbers up next to everyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9378)|
| 2:36:21| We think we're past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| And how do we think that is if you again look at results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| Commissioner Harmon used a big word the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| Somebody helped me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| Do I think there's a cause and effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| If you look at the five years prior, look at the five years since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| the funding at what the level is now to 45 percent for one organization who markets the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9396)|
| 2:36:44| We have gone from hotel motel funding of 3.8 million collections to Knox County to 5.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9404)|
| 2:36:51| I think that you're saying you can see from that that it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| These other organizations, as an example, and I'm going to use the symphony as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9414)|
| 2:37:00| The symphony itself, the organization, I don't believe wakes up every morning and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| what can we do to get people to come from out of town to stay in our hotels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9425)|
| 2:37:11| I just don't think they think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| The symphony is not listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| Well, I'm just using an example that we've used before because we're funding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| The Rosini Festival is a part of the symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| That, in fact, is an event that we will help promote and market because it does bring folks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9442)|
| 2:37:29| The same thing would be true at some of these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| The Dogwood Arts Festival, the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation does help market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9451)|
| 2:37:36| We did the rack cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9456)|
| 2:37:37| We do a lot of other things to help market it to out-of-town people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| We don't fund the organization itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| The same thing would be true for WDVX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| I don't believe they wake up every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| How do we get people to come from out of town to stay in our hotels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9470)|
| 2:37:54| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| Now, do, in fact, they put on wonderful programs that attract people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9479)|
| 2:38:00| And so, therefore, KTSC is very proud to support DVX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| We provide them with a studio, production room, and business offices at no cost to them because, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9484)|
| 2:38:09| it does create the environment, the uniquely Knoxville experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| We use it for familiarization tours where we bring people in for site visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9493)|
| 2:38:19| I don't think any of these other groups are having site visits with 50 or 60 people at different occasions during the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9499)|
| 2:38:25| or going to over 40 trade shows to try and convince people to come to Knoxville to stay in our hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9505)|
| 2:38:31| I think they go to other trade shows that help their core mission, core mission whether it be in the arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:37| whether it be in history, whether it be in music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9517)|
| 2:38:40| Those are, that's their core mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| Our core mission is to market Knox County as it relates to this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| and we'd like to think that we've done an okay job and we'd like to see that contract continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9527)|
| 2:38:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9533)|
| 2:38:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| I've been thinking about this quite a bit, and I tend to agree with Commissioner Harmon on several points that he makes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9541)|
| 2:39:10| but I think fundamentally the thing that sways me or influences me the most is just the success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9550)|
| 2:39:17| When I think about the organization, it's just successful, and there's no other way to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| It's successful, and it is so for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| I think both because of its structure, I think because of its leadership, and I'm a big leadership guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9565)|
| 2:39:34| and I've worked for a lot of people in my years in the school system and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9574)|
| 2:39:42| and certainly Ms. Ray, and I don't want to, I mean, I don't know everything about Ms. Ray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9582)|
| 2:39:50| but I have observed Ms. Ray for several years, and I am so highly impressed with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9590)|
| 2:39:58| The meetings that we have, and I'm on the board for the sports corp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| When you go into a meeting, I mean, she just energizes and livens everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9601)|
| 2:40:06| It's certainly, it's a unique experience to be around Ms. Ray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9606)|
| 2:40:13| and I understand why that organization is successful, why her track record is so good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9613)|
| 2:40:21| why she has, I mean, it's a performance-based contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9621)|
| 2:40:26| She's accomplished her goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9626)|
| 2:40:31| It is based on performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| There's without a doubt that that takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9632)|
| 2:40:37| You know, so anyway, the people are the big thing to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9637)|
| 2:40:41| and if I was looking for a job, which I probably will be in about a year and a half, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9641)|
| 2:40:49| I'd certainly like to work for somebody like Ms. Ray, and if I was a leader, I'd certainly like to be like her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9649)|
| 2:40:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9657)|
| 2:40:58| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| Gloria, the five percent, how much money in dollars and cents are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| If you reduce 45 to 40, what's the figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9663)|
| 2:41:06| Around $300,000, I believe, somewhere in that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| What would you do with that $300,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9670)|
| 2:41:13| Well, interesting you ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:16| Commissioner Hammond one day was trying to convince me that going from 45 to 40 wouldn't be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9676)|
| 2:41:21| because I was so bright and energetic and we had wonderful people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9681)|
| 2:41:24| and creative people in our office and we could get over that hump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| And if you're not, you're not worth that $191,000 we're paying you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| And then the next day he says, you know, somebody needs to be more creative and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| I mean, I thought, well, I got dumb overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| But anyway, in reality, some of the things that we do collectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9696)|
| 2:41:41| number one is the Geiger contract that we have that we do from a standpoint of trying to get national coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9701)|
| 2:41:49| I think several of the groups that are up here mentioned the article in the New York Times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9709)|
| 2:41:56| If you look at some of the publications, the visitor's guide that we distributed to nearly 400,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9716)|
| 2:42:02| we have gone from a four-page pamphlet to like a 48-page book that is distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9722)|
| 2:42:10| We have just gone through R&D, research and development, on what we call Touch, Know, and Go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9730)|
| 2:42:16| which is a virtual concierge in North Knoxville at Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9736)|
| 2:42:22| We call that a touch pad type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| But it will be going in five different parts of the county for people to be able to access where are places to eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9745)|
| 2:42:31| where are attractions to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| As an example would be in the restaurant category alone, if you look at ours, there's going to be 700 restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9753)|
| 2:42:40| That will include Chandler's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| That will include the Lunchbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| That will include all the people that have restaurants that our tourists should know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9763)|
| 2:42:49| This is an initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9769)|
| 2:42:50| Just the R&D alone has cost us almost $100,000, and we hope to implement those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| It's in our capital budget for next year to be able to begin to distribute these across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9775)|
| 2:43:00| They're also accessible by PDAs and by computers from off-site for tourists to learn where to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9780)|
| 2:43:06| what to do, and how to spend their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| My point would be if you took that money away collectively, I don't think that the Knoxville Beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9788)|
| 2:43:16| Keep Knoxville Beautiful and the South Knoxville Memorial is going to want to come together and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9796)|
| 2:43:22| let's do this because, number one, the $30,000 together is not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9802)|
| 2:43:26| So it's those types of, even though I apologize if it's not very creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9806)|
| 2:43:31| I would state the fact that what we are doing with the money is very creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| and I would hate to see us go backwards to where we were five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| and go back to not pulling the money together and marking it together as a package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9820)|
| 2:43:45| So that's what I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| Honda Hoot just finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9828)|
| 2:43:49| How many people do we have in for Honda Hoot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| Honda Hoot this year was about 12,000 to 13,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| We had FLW here last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| I mean, if you look at the events that you talk about just in these last few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| you've got to go down through here and ask the question again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| who was involved in the recruitment of that organization to come to our town and stay in the hotel rooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:11| Now, while they were here, did we plan trips to the various organizations and attractions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9851)|
| 2:44:16| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| Did we make them aware of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:18| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9858)|
| 2:44:19| We have a value Knoxville card that we work with all the different attractions to where when you come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9859)|
| 2:44:25| and you're staying in a hotel at a convention, meeting, or sporting event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9865)|
| 2:44:28| you get a little card just like a credit card that goes and you can use everywhere around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9868)|
| 2:44:33| And it's these types of collaborative efforts, whether it be renting buses to take people on tours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:39| to all these things, individually that amount of money is not going to do anything to bring out-of-town people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9879)|
| 2:44:46| into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| Is it, in fact, going to allow them to promote themselves to the Knoxville community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| I think it would be a great help to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| Is that what the intention of the Hotel Motel Tax Fund is to grow tourism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9893)|
| 2:44:58| I think just to promote themselves locally and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| That's why County Executive Schumpert, Frank Luthold, and Wanda Moody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9902)|
| 2:45:06| after studying it for several years, not a few months, but several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9906)|
| 2:45:10| moved it into the community grants because it is, in fact, the fabric of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| as to who we are, the uniqueness of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9914)|
| 2:45:16| I guess my final point would be that knowing about this business, it's highly competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9916)|
| 2:45:22| You're in competition with Austin, Texas, Charlotte, North Carolina, San Francisco, Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9922)|
| 2:45:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9928)|
| 2:45:29| In Honohook this week, there were four other cities here in contention that were trying to move that business around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| Were we aware of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9934)|
| 2:45:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9935)|
| 2:45:36| Did-I don't even know who's on the list-was all these organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| were they there to try and protect that event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| Were they there and actually talking to the decision makers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| Or were they there doing their core mission, which is to share the history of East Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9947)|
| 2:45:53| Example would be, and I told the lady from East Tennessee History Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9953)|
| 2:45:57| and is that we have money in our budget for this year because they're coming on a big event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9957)|
| 2:46:02| this late this summer or this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| That will be part of our-one of our initiated or an initiative that we focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9964)|
| 2:46:09| for that particular organization because it is, in fact, a big event for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9969)|
| 2:46:14| and we will actually help bring folks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| Gloria Ray, I think that you do a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| I just wanted to say that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| And I know that the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation has done a lot for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| And I also know that destination marketing organizations offer a variety of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9989)|
| 2:46:38| And some of that is merchandise sales, Internet access, ticket sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=9998)|
| 2:46:43| lodging reservations, restaurant reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10003)|
| 2:46:46| And you all have the unique component to have the Sports Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| incorporated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| However, the figures and the success that you have had is only enhanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10012)|
| 2:46:59| by the Knoxville Convention Center, which was established in July 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10019)|
| 2:47:06| And most destinations have a convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| And so I want everybody to remember that having a convention center here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10030)|
| 2:47:16| is a huge pull in bringing places and having-now, we need to up a little bit on hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10036)|
| 2:47:23| We don't have enough hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| But we do have a convention center, and that's a great pull for bringing people into this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| along with the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| I also wanted to share with you how, on destination profiles, how hotel room tax is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10052)|
| 2:47:44| It should go to a destination marketing organization, as it states in our statute, that 40 percent should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10064)|
| 2:47:55| But other uses include non-visitor-related purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10075)|
| 2:48:00| Thirty-eight percent is average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| Other visitor-related purposes, 26 percent is average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| And arenas and sports facilities is also another thing that hotel-motel room tax can go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10085)|
| 2:48:12| So I just wanted you all to realize that 45 percent is what they get now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10092)|
| 2:48:16| but 40 percent is in our statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| And there are a lot of other uses that they use across the country for the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10098)|
| 2:48:24| And that the added convention center is a huge pull for people to come into this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10104)|
| 2:48:31| And, again, I really appreciate all that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| I really enjoyed spending the day up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10114)|
| 2:48:36| They do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| But I'm in complete agreement with Commissioner Harmon that this is a tight year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10117)|
| 2:48:43| There are some destinations that could use the monies, and 40 percent, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| would be really quite fair given the current affair that we have in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10128)|
| 2:48:53| Just in addition to that, if I may, the national average from our national organization, DMAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10133)|
| 2:49:00| which, by the way, we have not announced publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| We were just awarded a certification as an official accredited DMAP, a destination marketing organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10143)|
| 2:49:12| That makes us made of like one of 35 in the whole United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10152)|
| 2:49:16| But what I wanted to throw in, the average hotel-motel tax collection is going to the destination organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10156)|
| 2:49:22| It's identified as around 55 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10162)|
| 2:49:26| That's from the national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10166)|
| 2:49:27| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| Ms. Glory, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| Obviously, I think we've all been aware of the Honda Hoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| All you had to do was pull up to a red light and you were familiar with the Honda Hoot was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10174)|
| 2:49:39| FLW and the Knoxville Open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| When we met with the commissioners, met with you guys at Cheryl's office back several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10182)|
| 2:49:48| one of the things, having been involved in economic development like I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| that impressed me was that you all's numbers, I thought, was on the short side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10192)|
| 2:49:58| You all definitely don't take advantage of building those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10198)|
| 2:50:02| You actually, I felt, were extremely conservative on the low side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| Those three events, what type of economic impact did those three events have on this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10207)|
| 2:50:14| I think I can't speak for the Knoxville Open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| We were not involved in that as a separate 501C3 organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10217)|
| 2:50:23| We were involved in the FLW and the Honda Hoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| The Honda Hoot, we are estimating at around $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10227)|
| 2:50:31| That's probably very conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10231)|
| 2:50:34| I'm going to mention the Junior Olympic Games, which many of you were involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10234)|
| 2:50:37| We estimated that between 25 and 30 because we're only counting the people that actually come to the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10237)|
| 2:50:42| We don't count their parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters and whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10242)|
| 2:50:46| because we're only counting those that are credentialed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| If I look at the Knoxville Open, it's very similar to several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10248)|
| 2:50:53| We had the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| Maybe you all saw it this weekend, the U.S. Olympic National Championship in Gymnastics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10254)|
| 2:50:59| While that was a great event and we were honored to have it, in reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| it only brought like 117 competitors and their families because it's been narrowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10263)|
| 2:51:09| You don't have the broad grassroots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| Same thing with the Knoxville Open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10271)|
| 2:51:12| You have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| There's only 146 golfers that are coming from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10274)|
| 2:51:18| So you look at their value in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| It's not what is the hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| A question that we ask some of these organizations is if you were to ask some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10283)|
| 2:51:27| how many hotel room nights have you blocked this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| I can tell you for one event alone, we blocked 60,000 hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10290)|
| 2:51:35| You've then got to ask these other organizations, and how many hotel rooms did you block?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| And then they realize, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| Maybe we're not in the business of getting people to come stay in hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10301)|
| 2:51:45| but we are in the business of being proud of our heritage and our culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10305)|
| 2:51:49| and we want to show it off, and it gives us something to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10309)|
| 2:51:52| But around $16 million for that, I think FLW was around $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| Again, because if you look at the numbers of fishermen, it was only 400 or 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| It's how many days they stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| So $20 million worth of economic benefit for this community for one weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10322)|
| 2:52:08| Yeah, but that's an economic impact number which everyone's going to challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10328)|
| 2:52:14| You know, did they go to Sevier County and spend some of their money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10334)|
| 2:52:17| How much did they spend in the hotels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| And that's why we're going strictly on something that can be verified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10339)|
| 2:52:23| But economic impact, I feel very comfortable with the numbers because we have downplayed them so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10343)|
| 2:52:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| We do need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| I appreciate short questions, short answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10354)|
| 2:52:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| Gloria, I am going to disagree with one statement you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10357)|
| 2:52:40| You said you were only doing an okay job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10360)|
| 2:52:42| I think you're doing a lot better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10362)|
| 2:52:46| I'm going to make a substitute motion that we go with the original motion to approve the contract as is at the 45 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10366)|
| 2:52:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| I have a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10378)|
| 2:52:59| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10379)|
| 2:53:05| He has to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10385)|
| 2:53:08| He's got to ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10388)|
| 2:53:09| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10389)|
| 2:53:13| The East Tennessee Film and Television Commission, would you be willing to house them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10393)|
| 2:53:19| and provide some of the same benefits that you do to WDBX?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10399)|
| 2:53:22| I think you'd be a great mentor for whoever the new film commissioner is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10402)|
| 2:53:27| The thing about the Film and Television Commission is they are in the business of they recruit a similar group that you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10407)|
| 2:53:36| and I think that nothing against the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| I think it's been a great home for the Film and Television Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10419)|
| 2:53:43| I just think that the tourism and sports location would be a better home for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10423)|
| 2:53:48| and I was just wondering whether you would be willing to house them at no charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10428)|
| 2:53:53| so that the small amount we've allocated for the film commission can go to pay a film commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10433)|
| 2:53:59| Since the meetings of last week, the two or three days of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10439)|
| 2:54:04| and I heard the discussion going but nothing definitive in terms of housing or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10444)|
| 2:54:10| a couple of things I want to state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10450)|
| 2:54:11| Number one is there is not a turf issue between the chamber and myself or our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10451)|
| 2:54:17| I think the key decision maker here is, in fact, the board of the film commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10457)|
| 2:54:21| Yeah, this would be pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10461)|
| 2:54:22| I have since talked with Helen Short, who is chair of their board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10462)|
| 2:54:26| and have planned to meet with their board along with Rhonda Rice from the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10466)|
| 2:54:31| and let's sit down and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10471)|
| 2:54:34| Rent is certainly, we would try and make room for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| We need to iron out whether if it's the telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| When the telephone rings, we're probably not going to answer it, East Tennessee Film Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| We will answer it, Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10483)|
| 2:54:46| You know, are those types, like with DVX, they do really well on their own in terms of my mentoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10486)|
| 2:54:52| All I'm doing is saying, here's a place to do your thing, and they're very committed to their program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10492)|
| 2:54:58| just like I think the gentleman that's here with the film commission right now is very committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10498)|
| 2:55:02| to what he wants to see done, and the board is very supportive of the gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10502)|
| 2:55:07| And if we can help maintain that and see the success across the country, I'm just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10507)|
| 2:55:12| I don't want, I want to manage expectations somewhat here in terms of we're going to meet with the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:18| and space shouldn't be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10520)|
| 2:55:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10521)|
| 2:55:22| We have a second to motion on the floor to go back to the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10527)|
| 2:55:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10528)|
| 2:55:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10529)|
| 2:55:30| The ayes have it, 17 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| I know there's more than just one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| Oh, I didn't hear, but who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| Commissioner DeFrese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10539)|
| 2:55:40| Who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10540)|
| 2:55:41| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10541)|
| 2:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10542)|
| 2:55:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10543)|
| 2:55:44| Kingston DeFrese and Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10544)|
| 2:55:47| One ninety-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10547)|
| 2:55:50| So the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10550)|
| 2:55:55| Fifteen to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10555)|
| 2:56:00| Do you vote anymore, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| Don't you vote anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| Oh, I passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| I didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| I voted yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| Nine thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10572)|
| 2:56:13| Most of the time not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10573)|
| 2:56:14| It's nine thirteen next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| We've got one out, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10578)|
| 2:56:26| Resolution nine thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10586)|
| 2:56:29| It's terminating the operating contract between the Public Building Authority and Knox County Public Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10589)|
| 2:56:34| buildings for management, security, and or maintenance services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10594)|
| 2:56:44| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| Vote at seven two, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| I know to divert for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10610)|
| 2:56:54| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| It says no recommendation on the book here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10616)|
| 2:56:59| It said nine fourteen, didn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10619)|
| 2:57:00| Thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| Thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10622)|
| 2:57:03| Motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| Mr. Chairman, John Troy, did we vote to do this when we did the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10627)|
| 2:57:11| I mean, in a sense, when we approved the budgets, did we approve a reduction for the Public Building Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10631)|
| 2:57:17| and put these things up for bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10637)|
| 2:57:20| The pieces that we have up for bid are the custodial services and lawn maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10640)|
| 2:57:26| and we still are counting on PBA to do security and building maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10646)|
| 2:57:33| and that's part of our expectation, and we could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10653)|
| 2:57:36| If this were to pass, we could not get this out for bid before July the 1st starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10656)|
| 2:57:42| and so we need PBA to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| So of those things, you're talking about the lawn maintenance and what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10664)|
| 2:57:49| The custodial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10669)|
| 2:57:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10670)|
| 2:57:51| What about utility bills, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| Yeah, we're doing the utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| So the utility bills now would be paid directly by the staff of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10675)|
| 2:58:00| Starting July the 1st, right, by the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10680)|
| 2:58:03| Okay, we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10685)|
| 2:58:06| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| Where are we in the bid process on the items that you did put out for bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10688)|
| 2:58:13| Are they still open or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10693)|
| 2:58:14| We are ready to award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| and we expect to bring forth proposed contracts in the July meeting for the commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10696)|
| 2:58:24| Commissioner Roundtree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10704)|
| 2:58:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10705)|
| 2:58:28| I want this commission to understand one thing that you probably are not aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10708)|
| 2:58:33| and that is the security systems that are associated in PBA's network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10713)|
| 2:58:39| that are installed at the East Tennessee History Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10719)|
| 2:58:43| and at the libraries and some of the branch libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10723)|
| 2:58:47| And I want to speak especially to the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10727)|
| 2:58:52| There are artifacts in that collection that are irreplaceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10732)|
| 2:58:57| but you cannot place a value on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10737)|
| 2:59:00| And when that building was constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| the PBA was involved with the design and installation of the security systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10743)|
| 2:59:10| It would be very, very expensive to remove those systems from the installation scenario that they're now in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10750)|
| 2:59:26| and transfer them to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10766)|
| 2:59:30| If I could, I'd like to get Mr. Sparks with PBA to come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10770)|
| 2:59:34| and tell you a little bit about what systems are installed at the History Center, how they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10774)|
| 2:59:41| And, Larry, if you could approach it and identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10781)|
| 2:59:45| And please be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10785)|
| 2:59:50| He has a bad habit of being long-winded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| I'm Larry Sparks with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10794)|
| 2:59:57| I manage security and life safety systems in PBA-managed properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10797)|
| 3:00:04| The East Tennessee History Center has 32 cameras that come into the City-County Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10804)|
| 3:00:13| Communications Center that's monitored 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10813)|
| 3:00:18| We have an intrusion alarm system up there on all floors and areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10818)|
| 3:00:24| that's monitored by PBA at the same communications center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10824)|
| 3:00:31| We manage the access control via American Magnetic's card key system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10831)|
| 3:00:42| program cards for contractors, employees up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10842)|
| 3:00:49| We do security background investigations on contractors coming in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10849)|
| 3:00:56| that has access to various areas in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10856)|
| 3:01:01| And in general, just manage the overall life safety systems to do with inspections of life safety equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10861)|
| 3:01:14| fire-related issues such as sprinklers and other equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10874)|
| 3:01:22| Thank you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10882)|
| 3:01:23| I think it's easy to see that it's not wise to pull the plug on the security systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10883)|
| 3:01:28| And I would like to offer a friendly amendment that would delete the word security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10888)|
| 3:01:37| and its systems to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10897)|
| 3:01:45| I'll make the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| Victoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10907)|
| 3:02:06| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10926)|
| 3:02:07| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10927)|
| 3:02:08| Did we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10928)|
| 3:02:10| No one made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10930)|
| 3:02:11| I'll make a motion that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| And actually, this has sort of been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| But I think that the cleaning, the lawn maintenance, utility security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10940)|
| 3:02:24| and the maintenance all need to be severed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10944)|
| 3:02:27| And I know that as commissioners that we all want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10947)|
| 3:02:30| That's why we're all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10950)|
| 3:02:32| I know that in our heart that you all want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| And we had a meeting this past week, an informational meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10955)|
| 3:02:40| And several of you, I know, had just conflicts that were not able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10960)|
| 3:02:44| And there were only five here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| So I would like to ask Lynn Redman to come up to the floor, to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| And I'd like for you to share a little bit from a personal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| He served at one point with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10973)|
| 3:02:57| And he currently serves on the Library Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10977)|
| 3:03:01| Now, I know that the commissioners here that we want to do what's best for the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10981)|
| 3:03:06| and tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| I wanted to let you know that in some information that PBA distributed at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10988)|
| 3:03:12| that several of you missed, it says that the goal is to always operate under budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10992)|
| 3:03:19| allowing refund of any unused funds at year end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| For example, over the last three fiscal years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11002)|
| 3:03:24| more than $898,000 has been returned to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11004)|
| 3:03:28| because the PBA has been able to operate under budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| Do you know how many books that would have bought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11011)|
| 3:03:34| Okay, that's $898 over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11014)|
| 3:03:37| And this is something else that several of you missed that I thought that you should know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11017)|
| 3:03:40| It says that their costs are not marked up in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11020)|
| 3:03:43| The PBA does not have fund balance or retained earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| But now listen to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11026)|
| 3:03:48| Certain operating reserves are carried for clients through mutual arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11028)|
| 3:03:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| My name is Lynn Redmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11041)|
| 3:04:02| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11042)|
| 3:04:07| I am a current member of the Knox County Library Advisory Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11047)|
| 3:04:10| and I guess I need to make it very clear I'm not speaking for the rest of the library board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| and certainly not speaking for the library administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11054)|
| 3:04:18| I'm a former board member of the Public Building Authority Board of Directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11058)|
| 3:04:22| so I have some knowledge of how public building authority works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11062)|
| 3:04:26| and what its strong points are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| What this disagreement that seems to be going on for the last couple of months is really about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11069)|
| 3:04:34| it's not about politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11074)|
| 3:04:36| It's not about power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11076)|
| 3:04:37| I don't have any bad, terrible things to say about PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11077)|
| 3:04:41| It's about how does the library use the taxpayers' money in the most efficient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11081)|
| 3:04:48| I and a lot of other library supporters look at the history of the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11088)|
| 3:04:53| For the last hundred years in this city and this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11093)|
| 3:04:56| the city library, the county library, the combined system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| did all of these functions on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| It's only since 2004 that the Public Building Authority has added another layer of management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11102)|
| 3:05:09| on top of the county management that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11109)|
| 3:05:12| In other words, we have John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| We have Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| We have a whole bid process system that's currently working on contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11116)|
| 3:05:21| for some of those functions we are taking over for PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11121)|
| 3:05:25| This is not rocket science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| It's not even open-heart surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11128)|
| 3:05:30| It's maintenance, things that the county has done and it does for other agencies, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11130)|
| 3:05:38| What we are trying to get out of, very simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11138)|
| 3:05:40| is the overhead costs that we must pay to PBA when utility bills are written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:46| when security systems are put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11146)|
| 3:05:51| Again, PBA is the Mercedes of building management and property management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11151)|
| 3:05:59| If we had taxpayer dollars flowing in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| if we weren't having to cut agencies' budgets in every way we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11162)|
| 3:06:06| I'd say keep those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11166)|
| 3:06:09| But we're not to that point in the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| We're having to choose between PBA fees and books for children or programs and story times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11171)|
| 3:06:18| We're struggling to balance to keep branches open, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11178)|
| 3:06:23| I'm a big supporter of branch libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11183)|
| 3:06:26| I'm not one that says close branches to save a dollar here or there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11186)|
| 3:06:30| They perform an important function for people across this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11190)|
| 3:06:36| Would I like to see the contract terminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11196)|
| 3:06:39| Speaking personally, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| Obviously, there's going to be some transition time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| This is not something we'll do in a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11203)|
| 3:06:46| But I think to the credit of the county administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11206)|
| 3:06:49| they certainly realize the point and they are certainly moving toward it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11209)|
| 3:06:53| If it doesn't happen today, in the next couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11213)|
| 3:06:56| there's no doubt that this arrangement probably will be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11216)|
| 3:07:01| It's going to give the library a little more control of its functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| I know this afternoon when the air conditioning is shutting down in the big library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11224)|
| 3:07:09| and they're closing floors, certainly their response time will be a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11229)|
| 3:07:14| I know they've been waiting five years for that upgrade in their AC system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11234)|
| 3:07:18| hopefully with a little different arrangement, though that won't be quite so long in coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11238)|
| 3:07:23| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11243)|
| 3:07:27| There has also been mention of economy of scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| The cost per square foot has gone up from $4.29 in 2003 to $5.45 since 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11250)|
| 3:07:38| I've sent this to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| You know about the operational costs have gone up tremendously since PBA took over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11260)|
| 3:07:45| and that the materials has gone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11265)|
| 3:07:48| So my motion I would like for you all to consider is to have a complete severance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11268)|
| 3:07:53| from the public building authority from the library system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11273)|
| 3:07:56| and allow operational independence for the library system for cleaning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11276)|
| 3:08:00| lawn maintenance, utility security, and building maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11280)|
| 3:08:04| I'll second her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11286)|
| 3:08:09| Is there anything, any questions to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11289)|
| 3:08:13| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| Who was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11297)|
| 3:08:18| I probably violated the rules of order, but I offered a friendly amendment to the motion prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11298)|
| 3:08:25| We didn't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11307)|
| 3:08:28| And I would like to offer a substitute motion at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11308)|
| 3:08:34| And that substitute motion would delete the word security from this resolution 913.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11314)|
| 3:08:44| I'm going to second it because I want to have some more discussion on this security issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11324)|
| 3:08:49| We have a substitute motion on the floor to go with the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11329)|
| 3:08:54| but delete security out of that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11334)|
| 3:08:58| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11338)|
| 3:09:01| I want to follow up on this security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11341)|
| 3:09:02| I'm all in favor of the lawn and the custodial and the management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| This security thing, Mr. Roundtree, you've piqued my interest in some of the things that you've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11345)|
| 3:09:09| because knowing of the historical center and the things that are in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11349)|
| 3:09:15| if indeed PBA did not provide security, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11355)|
| 3:09:20| I guess they would have to fire their own security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11360)|
| 3:09:23| They're going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11363)|
| 3:09:24| And who would be in charge of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11364)|
| 3:09:25| How would the hierarchy of that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11365)|
| 3:09:28| Well, you've got thousands of wires running into that control center downstairs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11368)|
| 3:09:34| You just don't unplug that and plug it up at ADT or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11374)|
| 3:09:39| You don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| There's a very complex series of TV cameras down there, motion detectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11381)|
| 3:09:46| I mean, gosh, we're protecting Davy Crockett's rifle over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11386)|
| 3:09:51| and you just don't pull the plug one day and plug it into somebody else's system the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11391)|
| 3:09:58| It doesn't work like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11398)|
| 3:09:59| Now, what about individual libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11399)|
| 3:10:01| They don't actually do they have cameras at the individual libraries or just the historical center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11401)|
| 3:10:07| They have alarm systems that are fairly simple pieces of equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11407)|
| 3:10:12| but the stuff at the East Tennessee History Center is not simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11412)|
| 3:10:16| It's very, very complex and very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11416)|
| 3:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11419)|
| 3:10:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11420)|
| 3:10:22| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11422)|
| 3:10:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11425)|
| 3:10:27| I guess, Lynn, could I ask you a couple of questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11427)|
| 3:10:31| Also, is Dale Smith still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11431)|
| 3:10:34| I saw him, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11434)|
| 3:10:36| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11436)|
| 3:10:37| Back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11437)|
| 3:10:38| Get ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11438)|
| 3:10:39| Start walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11439)|
| 3:10:45| I appreciate Ms. DeFreeze's comments about especially we're just here trying to do the best thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11445)|
| 3:10:53| the right thing, the most efficient thing, the most physically responsible thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11453)|
| 3:10:58| But logically, I just have a lot of trouble with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11458)|
| 3:11:02| because libraries are about books and media and information and, you know, that's their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11462)|
| 3:11:08| And the PBA is about buildings, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11468)|
| 3:11:12| I mean, logically, that's their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11472)|
| 3:11:14| So I just have a lot of trouble going, well, the library are experts at information systems and media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11474)|
| 3:11:21| The PBA are experts at buildings and maintenance, security, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11481)|
| 3:11:26| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11486)|
| 3:11:27| And Dale has this wonderful statement, you know, in God we trust, all others supply data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11487)|
| 3:11:32| Well, we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11492)|
| 3:11:34| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11494)|
| 3:11:35| That's our job is to evaluate the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11495)|
| 3:11:39| And so that's what I want you to help me do, Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| Commissioner Norman, I'm more than happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| Let's use PBA's data, not mine, not the library's, not Knox County's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11504)|
| 3:11:50| Let's just use PBA's data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11510)|
| 3:11:52| This is the chart that they give out on cost per square foot for all the services they provide for the Knox County libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11512)|
| 3:12:00| We go back to when they took it over for the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11520)|
| 3:12:03| It was $3.79 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11523)|
| 3:12:07| Proposed budget for 2009, it's $5.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11527)|
| 3:12:14| Now, the number of square feet in that time have gone up easily by a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11534)|
| 3:12:20| In other words, the libraries have larger facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11540)|
| 3:12:23| What you're not seeing there, just from a management standpoint, is you're not seeing the economy of scale that we should be getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11543)|
| 3:12:31| In other words, the more square feet they're managing, the more expensive each square foot gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11551)|
| 3:12:37| There's something wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| And I don't know if any of you in business, if you had a cost rising 40 percent in four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11559)|
| 3:12:46| you would put a red flag to that and say, let's target that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11566)|
| 3:12:50| Let's see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11570)|
| 3:12:51| Can we do it as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| Can we save money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11573)|
| 3:12:56| Yes, it would be grand fun to say, we have so much money in Knox County, let people that worry about buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11576)|
| 3:13:03| But if you go back in the past in Knox County, if you can pick the most stereotyped, typical little old lady librarian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11583)|
| 3:13:11| like Mary Lou Rothrock, many others through the years, they've managed maintenance and security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11591)|
| 3:13:18| and all the functions of this library with an iron fist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11598)|
| 3:13:22| Yes, it would be more fun to talk about books all day, but really what we're all doing is trying to manage dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11602)|
| 3:13:28| not only this county commission, but the library system too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11608)|
| 3:13:32| This is just one of many things that people in the library administration have looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11612)|
| 3:13:38| Can we save some here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11618)|
| 3:13:39| Can we save some there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11619)|
| 3:13:40| It's important this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11620)|
| 3:13:41| I don't have to lecture commissioners on what a tough position you're all in in trying to fit revenue with expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11621)|
| 3:13:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11630)|
| 3:13:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11631)|
| 3:13:52| Dale, could you sort of address that for us also while you're hobbling up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11632)|
| 3:13:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11638)|
| 3:14:01| Commissioner, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11641)|
| 3:14:04| I guess let me, with due respect to Mr. Redman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11644)|
| 3:14:08| Mr. Redman was on the PBA board 16 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11648)|
| 3:14:12| and so I think that it's important to understand that he and I have never worked together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11652)|
| 3:14:19| and I think that you would suggest that that's quite a while since you've been on a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11659)|
| 3:14:25| to be making some of the comments that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11665)|
| 3:14:29| In regard to the cost per square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| I would tell you that when we were asked by Mayor Raxdale and his senior staff in 2003 to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11671)|
| 3:14:41| and make a proposal on taking over a number of properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11681)|
| 3:14:45| including the libraries, Tarleton Homes, Juvenile Justice Center, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| we put together a budget that includes our overhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11690)|
| 3:14:55| and in aggregate, the first year we took over, it was $400,000 less than the county had been spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11695)|
| 3:15:02| and that didn't include the county overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| So I think our cost effectiveness was actually very easy to discern at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11705)|
| 3:15:12| In regard to the increases, we've had federally mandated minimum wage increases that not only hit us directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11712)|
| 3:15:19| but for the most part hit contractors that are in our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11719)|
| 3:15:23| custodians, for the most part custodial people make minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11723)|
| 3:15:28| Grounds type people, lawn mowing services and that tend to be running minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11728)|
| 3:15:33| That's some of the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| The others are largely utility costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11734)|
| 3:15:37| I don't think it's news to anybody over the last five years that we've seen a steady stream of utility costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11737)|
| 3:15:43| In fact, personally, I'm thrilled that Mr. Troyer has decided to pay the utility costs himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11743)|
| 3:15:50| because now I no longer have exposure to the rate increases you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| Before, I had to try to manage the budget in spite of those increases, and so that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11754)|
| 3:16:02| I also want to comment on our overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11762)|
| 3:16:04| I've heard that mentioned more than a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| Do you know what your overhead is using exactly the same methodology as we use to calculate our overhead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11767)|
| 3:16:13| It is 17 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11773)|
| 3:16:16| Mine is about ten and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11776)|
| 3:16:18| I'll be glad to sit down and review those numbers with anybody who would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11778)|
| 3:16:23| but I think before you just throw stones at somebody or criticize a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11783)|
| 3:16:30| it's helpful to at least look at your own or look at like operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11790)|
| 3:16:39| I will also tell you that giving the libraries management of everything, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11799)|
| 3:16:50| You do as you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11810)|
| 3:16:51| You do as you see is the most appropriate move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11811)|
| 3:16:55| Are you going to be doing it cheaper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11815)|
| 3:16:59| Are you going to be doing equal quality in terms of the grounds or the buildings and that for less money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11819)|
| 3:17:06| I doubt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11826)|
| 3:17:07| I think what you're going to be doing is taking money that has been being spent on the buildings and buying books with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11827)|
| 3:17:13| and that's your prerogative, and maybe that's what you could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| You could also do that by just telling us to cut our budget by X in our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11836)|
| 3:17:22| I also would add, by the way, on the cost per square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11842)|
| 3:17:25| we've opened some of the libraries for more days and more hours over that window of time you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11845)|
| 3:17:36| Mr. Roundtree made an important point, and I wanted to expound on it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11856)|
| 3:17:42| Letting Mr. Frank run the buildings of the library system, like I said, not one of my most fun tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11862)|
| 3:17:51| If that's your choice, I respect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11871)|
| 3:17:53| If it's not your choice, I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11873)|
| 3:17:56| East Tennessee Historical Society is a very different creature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11876)|
| 3:18:00| It's a very complicated building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11880)|
| 3:18:02| They manage the entire construction of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11882)|
| 3:18:06| It's a very sophisticated set of systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11886)|
| 3:18:10| The only comment about just keeping us in the security component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11890)|
| 3:18:14| Mr. Sparks and I had had a discussion about what if the county wanted to keep us doing the security but remove maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11894)|
| 3:18:25| There are some fairly difficult issues we're going to have to work through if you went down that path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11905)|
| 3:18:30| and that is we use our maintenance technicians to service a lot of the life safety equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11910)|
| 3:18:36| that Larry's technicians both identify the cycles in which they have to be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11916)|
| 3:18:43| Some of those are state law driven, like your fire suppression systems and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| So I don't really know if it's going to work to separate maintenance and security just for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11927)|
| 3:18:53| I'm not saying it can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11933)|
| 3:18:55| I'm not saying we can't sit down and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| But when I say we need to sit down and look at it, I don't, frankly, mean you guys and me standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11937)|
| 3:19:02| I mean people who are going to really be doing the doing of it if you went down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11942)|
| 3:19:09| I'm going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11949)|
| 3:19:11| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11951)|
| 3:19:14| Commissioner Lambert is before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11954)|
| 3:19:16| Let him go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| Don't take his place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11958)|
| 3:19:21| I'm going to wrap her up, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11961)|
| 3:19:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11965)|
| 3:19:26| Do I have the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11966)|
| 3:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11967)|
| 3:19:28| I'm not going to vote on either of these proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11968)|
| 3:19:31| and the reason why I'm not is because we've just been given a new piece of data that I haven't had time to analyze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11971)|
| 3:19:42| I don't know what other proposals for security are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11982)|
| 3:19:45| I don't know what Mr. Frank would do about security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11985)|
| 3:19:48| We have a completely new question that's been dropped upon us in a meeting where we're expected to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11988)|
| 3:19:54| Now, prior to the current interpretation of the Open Meetings Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11994)|
| 3:19:58| this would have come out in commissioner rumors long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=11998)|
| 3:20:02| and there would possibly be alternative proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| But what happens, data like this comes out, and it's like a trump card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12006)|
| 3:20:10| and we don't have time to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12010)|
| 3:20:12| We don't have time to analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12012)|
| 3:20:14| We don't have time to explore alternative proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12014)|
| 3:20:18| And I know I'm criticized frequently for passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12018)|
| 3:20:22| but I'm going to pass on both of these because, quite simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12022)|
| 3:20:25| I've been handed a new piece of data that I'm not sure what the other options are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12025)|
| 3:20:31| so that's why I'm passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12031)|
| 3:20:34| And I think that in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12034)|
| 3:20:35| one thing I'd like to see from commissioners when we get this new electronic billboard service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12035)|
| 3:20:41| is that if you're going to bring out a piece of data like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12041)|
| 3:20:44| and I'm not criticizing Mr. Rountree because due to the current interpretation of the Open Meetings Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12044)|
| 3:20:51| he didn't have an opportunity to give me that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12051)|
| 3:20:54| But in the future, and I hope we get this system online quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12054)|
| 3:20:58| I would hope that everyone would get information out to the commission as quickly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12058)|
| 3:21:04| so that we can analyze, figure out what to do with new information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12064)|
| 3:21:10| so that something isn't held back like a trump card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12070)|
| 3:21:14| because literally you could kill just about anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12074)|
| 3:21:17| by throwing out a piece of information that people don't have time to analyze and deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12077)|
| 3:21:23| Anything could be killed with a piece of information like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12083)|
| 3:21:27| So I'm not going to vote on this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| and I just hope in the future if there's information like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12089)|
| 3:21:32| I'd like to get it before we're sitting in a meeting and have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12092)|
| 3:21:36| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12098)|
| 3:21:40| I guess Commissioner DeFries or whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12100)|
| 3:21:43| what does that leave on the table for if we go with Commissioner Rountree's substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12103)|
| 3:21:51| It just leaves, I guess, the maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| I thought that there's step one severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12116)|
| 3:22:02| This is what I understood when I went to go meet with John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12122)|
| 3:22:05| He said step one, they're going to remove cleaning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12125)|
| 3:22:08| lawn maintenance, and utilities from PBA's responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12128)|
| 3:22:12| Section two would have less security and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12132)|
| 3:22:15| So Commissioner Rountree's is to leave security, so that would leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12135)|
| 3:22:22| Cleaning, lawn maintenance, utilities, and building maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12142)|
| 3:22:26| Which would come off now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12146)|
| 3:22:27| So the only thing I guess we're talking about on the substitute motion is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12147)|
| 3:22:34| Is the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12154)|
| 3:22:35| Leave the security in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12155)|
| 3:22:36| Leave the security, but not the maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12156)|
| 3:22:42| Well, right now we've already trimmed all of it except for security and maintenance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12162)|
| 3:22:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12168)|
| 3:22:49| Everything except for security and building maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12169)|
| 3:22:52| Building maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12172)|
| 3:22:53| So the substitute motion would be everything except?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12173)|
| 3:22:59| Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12179)|
| 3:23:00| Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12180)|
| 3:23:02| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12182)|
| 3:23:05| Well, I just think we need to keep, I mean, our experts with the maintenance side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12185)|
| 3:23:11| I mean, when an air conditioner goes out or something that's got to be done as far as maintenance-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12191)|
| 3:23:24| I think they handle that pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12204)|
| 3:23:27| The library was doing that four years ago on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12207)|
| 3:23:32| Were they hiring that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12212)|
| 3:23:33| Do you know how they were doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12213)|
| 3:23:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| I don't think so, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12217)|
| 3:23:39| Who was handling the maintenance prior to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| They had their staff of maintenance people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12222)|
| 3:23:45| Both of those guys, as far as I know, are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12225)|
| 3:23:48| One of them's name is Bruce Carr, and the other one is Dave Gillam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12228)|
| 3:23:52| Gillam had been working over at the East Tennessee History Center for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12232)|
| 3:23:58| I don't know if he's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12238)|
| 3:24:01| Those guys now do a lot of work out in the field at some of the other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12241)|
| 3:24:08| What Dale Smith's talking about with his technicians is Mr. Sparks has a couple of guys that work with him exclusively in the alarms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12248)|
| 3:24:20| Ninety-nine percent of their work is with the life safety systems in the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12260)|
| 3:24:25| They do things like pulling wire, repairing motion detectors, repairing alarms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12265)|
| 3:24:32| contacting certain vendors for specific problems with access control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12272)|
| 3:24:38| That's where Dale's coming from with the maintenance piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12278)|
| 3:24:44| Plus, some of the larger equipment, for example, here in the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12284)|
| 3:24:52| there's a location in the computer room where the PVA maintenance staff has installed a water detector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12292)|
| 3:24:59| It's called a water bug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12299)|
| 3:25:00| It sits down underneath the floor of the computer room, and if there's a leak, and there has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12300)|
| 3:25:05| that detector goes off and notifies the people in the communications center, and they dispatch a maintenance person out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12305)|
| 3:25:11| So it's not only alarms and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12311)|
| 3:25:17| There are some maintenance pieces of the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12317)|
| 3:25:21| I guess my next question is for Dale Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12321)|
| 3:25:28| I hate for you to have to up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12331)|
| 3:25:34| If we were to cut all these services out, okay, that you're providing, would your budget change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12334)|
| 3:25:44| Well, certainly the direct operating costs of these assets would be zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12344)|
| 3:25:52| Our management overhead wouldn't change, and it didn't change when we took them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12352)|
| 3:25:57| We didn't add any finance department or anybody to my office or anybody to our IS when we took these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12357)|
| 3:26:06| So by cutting out all these services that you're providing, your overall budget won't change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12366)|
| 3:26:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12374)|
| 3:26:15| My overall budget will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| But our budget is kind of a, our budgets are developed sort of bottom up, building by building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12377)|
| 3:26:23| and then ultimately groups of buildings like libraries are aggregated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12383)|
| 3:26:29| But they, before your finance department's purposes, they see them disaggregated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12389)|
| 3:26:34| They see them property by property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12394)|
| 3:26:36| Any properties you take us out of, obviously, those direct operating costs go to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12396)|
| 3:26:43| So my budget certainly changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| Well, I'm just trying to figure out if your overhead doesn't change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12405)|
| 3:26:49| then the overhead that was being applied to the libraries would then have to be transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12409)|
| 3:26:54| to every other department across the county, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12414)|
| 3:26:58| Well, it would be transferred to the other county assets we manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12418)|
| 3:27:01| And I said that in the first letter that I sent you guys, because I wanted you to understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12421)|
| 3:27:06| that it had already been being paid in our management back in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12426)|
| 3:27:15| And so when we were asked to take on these extra assets, it would be like your overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12435)|
| 3:27:21| And by the way, I wasn't being critical about your overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12441)|
| 3:27:24| That's not a ridiculous overhead rate necessarily, depending on what business you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12444)|
| 3:27:29| But I think it's important to understand is it's being presented as if you do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12449)|
| 3:27:35| you're going to have this big windfall savings of that overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12455)|
| 3:27:39| And that's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| If you want to reduce our budgets to go buy books or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12461)|
| 3:27:48| every year we sit down with your finance and senior staff of the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12468)|
| 3:27:55| and negotiate these budgets and levels of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12475)|
| 3:27:58| And we're always willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12478)|
| 3:28:01| And Commissioner DeFries, I really appreciate you bringing this forward, because we schedule our services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12481)|
| 3:28:10| and cost our services by what the client wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12490)|
| 3:28:14| In this building, we try to run it at sort of the C-plus level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12494)|
| 3:28:18| You know, clean but not pristine, decent but not fancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12498)|
| 3:28:24| And those are all ways to open the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12504)|
| 3:28:27| Dale, I have a copy of the contract that was sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12507)|
| 3:28:30| It was for mowing and landscaping services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12510)|
| 3:28:32| And just on a little note, I noticed here that South Knox Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12512)|
| 3:28:36| and the Howard Pinkston Branch Library are both listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| And yet with PBA, all we're getting is mowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| We're not getting the landscaping services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| No, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12523)|
| 3:28:44| The only building that's unique, as you and I have discussed, is the Pinkston Branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12524)|
| 3:28:50| Well, it's listed here as being contracted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12530)|
| 3:28:52| But that's your bid form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12532)|
| 3:28:53| That's not mine, I believe you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12535)|
| 3:28:56| Okay, I want to know, Dale, certain operating reserves are carried for clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12536)|
| 3:29:00| through mutual arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12540)|
| 3:29:01| Who are you carrying operating reserves for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| What clients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12543)|
| 3:29:04| It had to be the city or the county, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12544)|
| 3:29:06| Well, the city, the county, and the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12546)|
| 3:29:10| So three categories of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| So what kind of reserves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12552)|
| 3:29:13| Those are carried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12553)|
| 3:29:14| I don't have them with me today to tell you exactly what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12554)|
| 3:29:18| but I certainly can get them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12558)|
| 3:29:19| Those are carried for the reason that if there's an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12559)|
| 3:29:24| a major equipment failure or whatever, we try to have enough money to cover it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12564)|
| 3:29:29| so we're not waiting until the next commission meeting to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12569)|
| 3:29:32| and appropriate money to replace the chiller that went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12572)|
| 3:29:37| Or in some cases like this building, it would be both the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12577)|
| 3:29:41| But what kind of reserves, what kind of figure, estimate are you holding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12581)|
| 3:29:46| I couldn't even give you an estimate off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12586)|
| 3:29:48| Well, I think that's rather interesting that you have enough reserves like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12588)|
| 3:29:51| and $898,000 has been returned to the county because the PBA has been able to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12591)|
| 3:29:55| under budget for the last three years of the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12595)|
| 3:29:58| Well, that number is not just for the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12598)|
| 3:30:01| That's for everything we manage for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12601)|
| 3:30:04| For the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12604)|
| 3:30:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12605)|
| 3:30:06| So there might be even more for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12606)|
| 3:30:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12609)|
| 3:30:10| Our funds for the assets are kept separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12610)|
| 3:30:14| So that's a county number, but that number is across budgets for juvenile justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12614)|
| 3:30:20| libraries, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12620)|
| 3:30:21| But I'm just saying that if your goal is always to operate under budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| and you also have a client with the city, there could be even more money like that for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12623)|
| 3:30:29| Well, the city knows and the county finance knows exactly what our reserves are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12629)|
| 3:30:33| In the budget, I don't know if Ms. Davis looked at it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12633)|
| 3:30:37| but Ms. Davis had asked for a copy of the budget we submit to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12637)|
| 3:30:41| I have no input in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12641)|
| 3:30:43| I don't build your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| It's built by your finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12645)|
| 3:30:48| My budget shows you for every asset what the reserve is on the second sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12648)|
| 3:30:53| The first sheet is the operating cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12653)|
| 3:30:55| The second sheet is any, quote, carry forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12655)|
| 3:30:59| which are the numbers like that that we give back to you if we have run under budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12659)|
| 3:31:07| And I know that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12667)|
| 3:31:09| That is a big number, and it sounds big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12669)|
| 3:31:12| The thing I would tell you and the thing that always scared us the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12672)|
| 3:31:16| we've had very, very mild winters in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12676)|
| 3:31:19| I don't know if that's global warming, and it will always be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12679)|
| 3:31:23| But I think it was the first winter I was here, we had a week of really cold, really nasty weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12683)|
| 3:31:30| And it doesn't take a lot with the kind of you're talking about an aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12690)|
| 3:31:34| We've got about two million square feet of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12694)|
| 3:31:37| It doesn't take much of a bad winter to put a real dent in those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12697)|
| 3:31:43| So, you know, your finance department knows any reserve we've got, exactly what asset it's in, what amount it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12703)|
| 3:31:53| And so it's cards face up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12713)|
| 3:31:57| I mean, we're not hiding any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| Do you know how many reserves they're holding for certain clients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12719)|
| 3:32:03| Yeah, we monitor that on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12723)|
| 3:32:06| What I wanted to say is that we've worked with Mr. Smith, and like Commissioner Lambert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12726)|
| 3:32:11| it takes a lot of time to go through a lot of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12731)|
| 3:32:15| There's the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12735)|
| 3:32:16| It's very complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12736)|
| 3:32:18| We have worked for a number of months on the transition and making sure that we have an orderly transition for the utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12738)|
| 3:32:25| for custodial, and for lawn maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12745)|
| 3:32:28| And they plan for it, we plan for it, and we're ready to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12748)|
| 3:32:33| And that's what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| We have not made a plan for security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12755)|
| 3:32:37| We have not made a plan for building maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12757)|
| 3:32:40| And those are much more complex than what we have made plans for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12760)|
| 3:32:43| And so what Mr. Smith has worked with us on getting us to this point and has been very cooperative on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12763)|
| 3:32:51| and we have done no planning on the security or the building maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12771)|
| 3:32:55| And so to say that we're going to cancel this contract, we need something that's going to take its place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12775)|
| 3:33:00| And it would take a number, it would take quite a while to put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12780)|
| 3:33:06| Going back to Commissioner Luthor, you had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12789)|
| 3:33:10| And Commissioner DeFries, you brought up some very excellent points, and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12790)|
| 3:33:16| I think the whole PBA issue needs to be looked into as a whole, not just necessarily about libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12796)|
| 3:33:25| And you did bring that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12805)|
| 3:33:27| And because what I see happening is he's not, PBA's not going to reduce their overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12807)|
| 3:33:36| That just means they're going to charge it to all the rest of the departments across Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12816)|
| 3:33:40| and the aggregate won't save Knox County any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12820)|
| 3:33:44| So I think maybe in the months to come, we probably need to do an analysis of what we want PBA to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12824)|
| 3:33:58| and not do for all of Knox County, and maybe then we could save some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12838)|
| 3:34:04| But I don't see just cutting out libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12844)|
| 3:34:06| If he's not going to cut his overhead, then ultimately we're not going to save any dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12846)|
| 3:34:10| At least I don't see it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12850)|
| 3:34:13| It would be allowing, I think, that PBA has been riding on the library's back for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12853)|
| 3:34:18| and at least would alleviate some pressure in that particular department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12858)|
| 3:34:22| and put it over on some other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12862)|
| 3:34:25| I agree the libraries need more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12865)|
| 3:34:28| I'm just not sure that this is really going to net them a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12868)|
| 3:34:33| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12873)|
| 3:34:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12876)|
| 3:34:37| I think we've talked about the library for the last three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12877)|
| 3:34:40| and in the meantime we have arrived at a position where utility bills are not being handled by PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12880)|
| 3:34:50| janitorial is not being handled by PBA, the lawn care or the lawn mowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12890)|
| 3:34:55| whatever we want to call that, is now back in our house somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12895)|
| 3:35:00| So is this motion that stands before us only has security and maintenance in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12900)|
| 3:35:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12908)|
| 3:35:09| Actually, I think the substitute motion has just security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12909)|
| 3:35:12| But I was going to suggest if Mr. Roundtree wanted to add maintenance, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12912)|
| 3:35:16| Well, that just puts us back to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12916)|
| 3:35:18| The original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12918)|
| 3:35:20| Which either means that we need more data to find out whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12920)|
| 3:35:23| or not the library system can do the security and maintenance as cheap as PBA can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12923)|
| 3:35:30| data which is not before us, or we need to defer this for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12930)|
| 3:35:37| or we just need to vote on it, one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| Well, we have a substitute motion, so we can have no more motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12939)|
| 3:35:43| Mr. Hammond, did you offer a friendly amendment to my substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12943)|
| 3:35:47| I was just going to say you only said security, but if you wanted to, there was another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12947)|
| 3:35:50| Well, I think the county, I think John Troyer says that's all they're going to be handling is security and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12950)|
| 3:35:56| So we don't need that motion because that's all they're going to be handling anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12956)|
| 3:36:01| Am I correct, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| That's not what the motion says, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12963)|
| 3:36:05| I know what the motion says, but what the county is actually doing is PBA is only going to be handling security and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12965)|
| 3:36:13| So there's no reason to have that motion because that's what we're already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12973)|
| 3:36:18| Now, the original motion is to cut all of that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12978)|
| 3:36:21| Your motion is to leave just security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| But what we're really doing is leaving security and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12983)|
| 3:36:28| If we don't do anything today, they're going to continue to do security and maintenance and nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12988)|
| 3:36:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12994)|
| 3:36:36| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12996)|
| 3:36:38| Not according to resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=12998)|
| 3:36:41| I've got a couple of things that I'd like the commission to take a look at with PBA whenever they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13001)|
| 3:36:47| One is there's quite a few layers of expensive management in PBA that obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13007)|
| 3:36:53| if it was being handled by Knox County with employees and Mr. Smith, I met you today for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13013)|
| 3:37:00| so this isn't anything against you or any of your employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13020)|
| 3:37:04| but that was one of the concerns that I had was just how much money people are making to oversee our buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13024)|
| 3:37:13| The other thing that concerned me was, and I don't really understand how this came about, but was PBA overseeing construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13033)|
| 3:37:22| Mr. Smith, you mentioned the East Tennessee Historical Society buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13042)|
| 3:37:26| You all had overseen that, and I know you all have had oversight on Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13046)|
| 3:37:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| That tends to concern me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13053)|
| 3:37:37| Being in the construction business, it's almost like hiring your brother to oversee something that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13057)|
| 3:37:46| Well, what I'm going to say may concern you more, although hiring your brother to watch over something for you isn't always a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13066)|
| 3:37:54| You obviously don't know my brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13074)|
| 3:37:56| Well, I don't know your brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13076)|
| 3:37:59| We're a classic consolidated function between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13079)|
| 3:38:04| We serve the city and the county both in project management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13084)|
| 3:38:09| We have managed every branch library you've built in the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13089)|
| 3:38:14| We've managed every building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13094)|
| 3:38:16| I've been here eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13096)|
| 3:38:17| We've managed every building the county's built except for a couple of the sheriff's small buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13097)|
| 3:38:25| We managed the jail addition at Maloneyville that was just completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13105)|
| 3:38:31| One of the reasons I know people love to focus on salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13111)|
| 3:38:35| Gloria Ray and I both make a good amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13115)|
| 3:38:38| Gloria Ray and I are both paid by our boards based on the market for what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13118)|
| 3:38:44| When I go out, for example, and try to recruit an experienced project manager like Jeff Gallion, who runs my department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13124)|
| 3:38:52| I have to pay a fair amount to get somebody who's truly competent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13132)|
| 3:38:57| People should be paid good money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13137)|
| 3:38:58| I just had his predecessor, who used to work for me before I got here and worked for me when I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13138)|
| 3:39:04| hired away from me by one of my former board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13144)|
| 3:39:07| He now makes more than I do, Blaise Burt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13147)|
| 3:39:09| Some of you know Blaise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13149)|
| 3:39:13| But in terms of what we do, I mean, I would be glad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13153)|
| 3:39:16| because one of the hardest parts about this whole conversation has been the relative lack of understanding by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13156)|
| 3:39:24| I think, about what we do, how we do it, what it costs, how we keep the separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13164)|
| 3:39:30| the city's business separate from the county's business, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13170)|
| 3:39:35| So I think it's a good idea for both of us, frankly, to have a much deeper level of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13175)|
| 3:39:42| We need to keep our comments and questions to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13182)|
| 3:39:46| Is that a hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13186)|
| 3:39:48| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13188)|
| 3:39:51| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13191)|
| 3:39:52| Because my substitute motion did not include one key word there that I wasn't thinking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13192)|
| 3:39:57| the word maintenance, because it does go hand in hand with security in a lot of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13197)|
| 3:40:01| I'm going to withdraw my motion, my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13201)|
| 3:40:05| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13205)|
| 3:40:06| So we just have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13206)|
| 3:40:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| You're going to withdraw your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13211)|
| 3:40:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13214)|
| 3:40:15| He withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13215)|
| 3:40:18| Here's what I'm struggling with is, you know, Victoria, you talk about saving that $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13218)|
| 3:40:23| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13223)|
| 3:40:24| That would be a lot of books for Larry and the group to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13224)|
| 3:40:29| But on the other hand, then when I see with the PBA there, because I know I own commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13229)|
| 3:40:36| I see PBA as that's their babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13236)|
| 3:40:40| That's their libraries or whatever that they take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13240)|
| 3:40:43| And it's a reflection on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13243)|
| 3:40:45| It's a reflection on Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| And I would like to think that there's a more sense of pride in PBA going out there and doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13247)|
| 3:40:54| than somebody says, well, I got the contract to cut the grass just this year, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13254)|
| 3:40:58| and then just to bid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13258)|
| 3:41:00| But on the other hand, I want to save some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13260)|
| 3:41:02| That's a great thing to do to put that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13262)|
| 3:41:05| That's where I'm torn as to what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13265)|
| 3:41:09| I'd make a motion that we postpone for 30 days, substitute motion that we postpone for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13269)|
| 3:41:13| until we get the information we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13273)|
| 3:41:17| Do we have a second to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13277)|
| 3:41:23| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13283)|
| 3:41:26| We have a motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13286)|
| 3:41:32| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13292)|
| 3:41:34| You know, if I understand this, the resolution is to do away with the total operating contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13294)|
| 3:41:47| I'd like somebody to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13307)|
| 3:41:48| Is that the five pieces, the lawn, the maintenance, the utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13308)|
| 3:41:52| That is what I intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13312)|
| 3:41:54| But apparently purchasing has done a two-part severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13314)|
| 3:41:59| Step one is cleaning, lawn maintenance, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13319)|
| 3:42:01| And they've already got contracts out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| And I don't understand why we cannot just go ahead and do those and defer security and maintenance to a later date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13323)|
| 3:42:08| since they've already got this bid process out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13328)|
| 3:42:15| Somebody address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13335)|
| 3:42:16| Is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13336)|
| 3:42:17| Is that your motion, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13337)|
| 3:42:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13338)|
| 3:42:20| That's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13340)|
| 3:42:24| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13344)|
| 3:42:25| We don't need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13345)|
| 3:42:26| So let's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13346)|
| 3:42:27| We don't need a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13347)|
| 3:42:28| So why defer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13348)|
| 3:42:29| The second part could be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13349)|
| 3:42:30| I mean, it could be looked at later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13350)|
| 3:42:31| The second part could be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13351)|
| 3:42:32| But let's go ahead and move to sever cleaning, lawn maintenance, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13352)|
| 3:42:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13361)|
| 3:42:42| Those responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13362)|
| 3:42:43| But it's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13363)|
| 3:42:44| That's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13364)|
| 3:42:45| That's already done, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13365)|
| 3:42:46| But that's not what our motion says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13366)|
| 3:42:49| Your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| Do you want to redo your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13371)|
| 3:42:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13373)|
| 3:42:55| Larry, will you withdraw your deferral, and then we'll vote on her changing her motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13375)|
| 3:43:05| It gets us back to what the mayor's office has already negotiated with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13385)|
| 3:43:11| But at least it has the stamp of approval from commission, which I think would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13391)|
| 3:43:16| We get a bathroom break in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13396)|
| 3:43:18| And as soon as we finish this, I'll ask for a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13398)|
| 3:43:23| We're going to do a five-minute recess at 545 and then start zoning at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13403)|
| 3:43:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13408)|
| 3:43:29| Yeah, I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13409)|
| 3:43:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13410)|
| 3:43:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13411)|
| 3:43:32| You withdraw your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13412)|
| 3:43:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13415)|
| 3:43:36| Withdraw substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13416)|
| 3:43:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13417)|
| 3:43:38| The motion on the floor is what's the original motion at 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13418)|
| 3:43:40| And I'd like to withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13420)|
| 3:43:41| You want to or just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13421)|
| 3:43:42| And have a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13422)|
| 3:43:44| The new resolution that I'd like to bring forward, the new motion, is to have a severance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13424)|
| 3:43:50| the responsibilities of PBA for cleaning, lawn maintenance, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13430)|
| 3:43:57| And have those be county responsibilities with the library system and allow the library to have some operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13437)|
| 3:44:03| independence in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13443)|
| 3:44:06| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13446)|
| 3:44:10| With John Troy, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13450)|
| 3:44:12| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13452)|
| 3:44:13| That's what's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13453)|
| 3:44:15| Well, we're just putting our stamp of approval on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13455)|
| 3:44:18| If that's what we want done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13458)|
| 3:44:22| Do you have something else, Commissioner DeFreeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13462)|
| 3:44:24| No, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13464)|
| 3:44:25| So the new motion is to, could you repeat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13465)|
| 3:44:31| The new motion is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13471)|
| 3:44:32| My motion is to sever these three aspects, these three responsibilities that PBA used to have over the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13472)|
| 3:44:41| Cleaning, lawn maintenance, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13481)|
| 3:44:45| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13485)|
| 3:44:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13487)|
| 3:44:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13488)|
| 3:44:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13489)|
| 3:44:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13491)|
| 3:44:55| Just so we're totally clear on it, what that does, Dale, don't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13495)|
| 3:44:59| One pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13499)|
| 3:45:01| That is that the commission is going to give you six-month notice, correct, under the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13501)|
| 3:45:08| You wish to weigh that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13508)|
| 3:45:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13509)|
| 3:45:10| In this case, Mr. Owings, because the mayor and Mr. Troyer have been working with us for a number of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13510)|
| 3:45:16| on this change, which I consider really a budgetary change, we don't need notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13516)|
| 3:45:22| We've already mutually agreed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13522)|
| 3:45:24| My board has approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13524)|
| 3:45:27| So I don't think we need to exercise notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13527)|
| 3:45:30| If you were going to go to the full boat termination as it was originally conceived, we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13530)|
| 3:45:37| In fact, it would take you six months to get even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13537)|
| 3:45:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13540)|
| 3:45:41| What the contract provides for is project by project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| But what you're doing, basically you're more or less conceding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13543)|
| 3:45:48| and you're waiving the 180-day notice provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13548)|
| 3:45:52| So as of July 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13552)|
| 3:45:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13554)|
| 3:45:55| The only thing I've asked for is these properties are assigned to us by an assignment letter under an umbrella contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13555)|
| 3:46:02| I'm looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13562)|
| 3:46:03| What we've asked is for a letter clarifying that we are no longer responsible for grounds, custodial, or utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13563)|
| 3:46:12| That will suffice and that will take care of it, and we can do that in the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13572)|
| 3:46:16| We'll get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13576)|
| 3:46:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13577)|
| 3:46:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13578)|
| 3:46:19| 9-14, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13579)|
| 3:46:23| Sir, resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13583)|
| 3:46:24| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13584)|
| 3:46:25| Can I ask that we listen to ordinance 108-6-101?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13585)|
| 3:46:31| Vicki Hatfield, who is the HR director for the city, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13591)|
| 3:46:34| And she normally leaves at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13594)|
| 3:46:36| And she's kind of, I'd like for her to speak to this a little bit if we could hear it out of turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13596)|
| 3:46:41| if no one has any objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13601)|
| 3:46:42| He's getting overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13602)|
| 3:46:43| Do we have any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13603)|
| 3:46:46| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13606)|
| 3:46:47| Which one was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13607)|
| 3:46:48| It's ordinance 8-6-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13608)|
| 3:46:52| It has to do with civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13612)|
| 3:46:57| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13617)|
| 3:46:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13618)|
| 3:46:59| This is a consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13619)|
| 3:47:03| amending the Knox County Charter to add Section 9.18 to Article 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13623)|
| 3:47:09| providing for the maintenance and administration of an effective civil service merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13629)|
| 3:47:15| for any or all Knox County employees in the classified service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13635)|
| 3:47:19| as determined by the Commission of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13639)|
| 3:47:23| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| Voted 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13647)|
| 3:47:28| 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13648)|
| 3:47:32| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13652)|
| 3:47:33| I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13655)|
| 3:47:38| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13658)|
| 3:47:39| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13659)|
| 3:47:41| Yeah, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13661)|
| 3:47:42| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13662)|
| 3:47:43| Are there costs associated with moving to civil service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13663)|
| 3:47:47| And I'm a proponent for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13667)|
| 3:47:50| But are there costs to putting it under civil service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13670)|
| 3:47:54| And how soon can you move to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13674)|
| 3:47:56| Well, I was assuming that since we were under a six-month hiring freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13676)|
| 3:48:00| that we would have time to kind of tweak that and really talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13680)|
| 3:48:05| and work with Ms. Hatfield and some other people to help us make that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13685)|
| 3:48:11| With regard to a cost, probably the only thing I could foresee would be your testing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13691)|
| 3:48:18| And there may be probably some office supplies with regard to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13698)|
| 3:48:22| Once you establish the merit board, there may be some costs associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13702)|
| 3:48:28| But there were a couple of changes I did want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13708)|
| 3:48:30| They were very minor changes under the rules that were sent out to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13710)|
| 3:48:46| It's on Page 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13726)|
| 3:48:47| It has to do with the provisional appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13727)|
| 3:48:50| And it explains that under it's Section 1-12, under Section B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13730)|
| 3:48:58| it talks about with provisional appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13738)|
| 3:49:02| it talks the necessity and the desirability of inclusion of positions within the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13742)|
| 3:49:06| shall be studied and determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13746)|
| 3:49:07| And I wanted to add by the board onto that as to who actually made those determinations and studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13747)|
| 3:49:14| And then also on Page 12, when it talks about who can be qualified to serve as a member of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13754)|
| 3:49:23| the minimum age requirement is 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13763)|
| 3:49:26| And I'd like to see that raised to age 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13766)|
| 3:49:29| I think that we need to at least have someone that's of legal age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13769)|
| 3:49:35| Is that legal to change it from 18 to 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13775)|
| 3:49:38| They can drink beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13778)|
| 3:49:39| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| I'd just like to know what departments are going to be considered in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13781)|
| 3:49:45| Well, all departments excluding the sheriffs and then the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13785)|
| 3:49:52| It would also exclude the court clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13792)|
| 3:49:57| It would also exclude any, you know, department related to the judicial branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13797)|
| 3:50:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13803)|
| 3:50:04| How about fee offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13804)|
| 3:50:07| It does not exclude fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13807)|
| 3:50:10| I know there will be, you know, a lot of discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13810)|
| 3:50:16| Let me tell you one more thing, what we had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13816)|
| 3:50:21| We had put this draft together, and I thought that we had, yeah, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13821)|
| 3:50:31| The ordinance that you have in your packet, the court page ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13831)|
| 3:50:40| is what would basically what would be in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13840)|
| 3:50:46| It would leave for a later date the civil service merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13846)|
| 3:50:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13855)|
| 3:50:59| And what our office did is we looked at what Shelby County had and created a draft of one for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13859)|
| 3:51:13| I would assume that this is such a significant change in the way that we do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13873)|
| 3:51:18| that you would want to have a workshop or two on it, which would include the other fee offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13878)|
| 3:51:23| and other offices because essentially what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13883)|
| 3:51:26| you're going from an at-will employment state of affairs that we have now to one which would require calls for termination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13886)|
| 3:51:38| for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13898)|
| 3:51:42| If you just look at the ordinance itself in creating the civil service merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13902)|
| 3:51:47| that's kind of what we have in mind in order to create it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13907)|
| 3:51:52| And later on, the details of the ordinance, basically through the enabling legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13912)|
| 3:51:58| we're allowed to have a civil service system for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13918)|
| 3:52:03| What this would do is create it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13923)|
| 3:52:05| It would take advantage of that enabling legislation under the charter legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13925)|
| 3:52:10| and then it would come back to this body in the months that follow if this is adopted by the voters of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13930)|
| 3:52:21| to iron out the details of the civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13941)|
| 3:52:26| This is a matter if it's voted on twice and approved twice, it would go on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13946)|
| 3:52:35| Talking about ballot initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13955)|
| 3:52:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13957)|
| 3:52:40| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13960)|
| 3:52:44| Yes, I just had a question, a couple of questions really about the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13964)|
| 3:52:48| Does this say if we pass this, does it say that we will have a civil service system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13968)|
| 3:52:54| even as we go through the workshops, if we find out that we may want to do it or call it something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13974)|
| 3:52:59| I mean, we will have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13979)|
| 3:53:01| No, it's up to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13981)|
| 3:53:03| If you're talking about whether the commission passes it or if it's passed by the voters in the November election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13983)|
| 3:53:11| it would have to be voted on and passed, and then it would come back to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13991)|
| 3:53:18| I believe it's worded to where it comes back to the commission to work out the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=13998)|
| 3:53:23| What we've done, we've also done, because I'm not going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14003)|
| 3:53:28| is provided a draft of a sample ordinance, which is pretty much what they have and have passed in Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14008)|
| 3:53:38| It's a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14018)|
| 3:53:40| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14020)|
| 3:53:41| And my second question was, and it's under Section 19 or Section 918A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14021)|
| 3:53:47| when we say that it's all Knox County employees employed by the mayor, property assessor, sheriff, register of the deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14027)|
| 3:53:54| So are we including all of those or are we excluding any of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14034)|
| 3:53:58| We had included the sheriff in this one, in this draft ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14038)|
| 3:54:07| but that is not what you're voting on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14047)|
| 3:54:12| What you're voting on, I mean, that's the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14052)|
| 3:54:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14056)|
| 3:54:17| What you're voting on is the ordinance to place it on the ballot for the voters to decide whether they wish for their government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14057)|
| 3:54:25| to be governed by a civil service merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14065)|
| 3:54:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14068)|
| 3:54:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14069)|
| 3:54:30| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14070)|
| 3:54:31| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14071)|
| 3:54:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14072)|
| 3:54:33| Ms. Fogerson, could I ask you a question about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14073)|
| 3:54:41| Basically, I guess my-again, we're trying to figure out what to do, what the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14081)|
| 3:54:48| what the proper order of events would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14088)|
| 3:54:50| According to you, what would you like to see us do as regards the merit system or the consideration thereof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14090)|
| 3:54:59| I have a few questions about what this involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14099)|
| 3:55:02| I'm not sure that I'm real clear about what you plan to do if we have a merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14102)|
| 3:55:10| Knox County has a personnel system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14110)|
| 3:55:14| We have very detailed personnel policies passed by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14114)|
| 3:55:21| Very detailed job descriptions, a job description for every position we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14121)|
| 3:55:27| stating the education, the experience requirements or credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14127)|
| 3:55:32| We have a very detailed compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14132)|
| 3:55:36| And what's not clear to me is whether or not having a merit system means that we start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14136)|
| 3:55:45| So, Commissioner Beller, when you ask, is there a cost involved, I think that if you're asking us to redevelop a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14145)|
| 3:55:53| compensation system, redevelop the policies and procedures and the job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14153)|
| 3:56:00| and all of those things that are currently in place, there would be a great deal of cost involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14160)|
| 3:56:05| So, it's just not clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14165)|
| 3:56:07| Are we saying that we just want to add some written employment tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14167)|
| 3:56:13| or are we wanting to restructure everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14173)|
| 3:56:17| Well, I think this is a reaction like a lot of things that are happening in the last year or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14177)|
| 3:56:24| a reaction to all the negative publicity about county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14184)|
| 3:56:28| Of course, nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14188)|
| 3:56:29| Everybody that's employed in Knox County is either a cousin or a brother now, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14189)|
| 3:56:33| And so, and we all know that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14193)|
| 3:56:38| And that's what I fear is the overreaction to something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14198)|
| 3:56:46| we just want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14206)|
| 3:56:49| We have a system in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14209)|
| 3:56:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14211)|
| 3:56:52| The consideration of a civil service merit system may be in order right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14212)|
| 3:56:57| But you're the professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14217)|
| 3:56:59| You're the people that would have to deal with its implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14219)|
| 3:57:03| So, we definitely need guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14223)|
| 3:57:08| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14228)|
| 3:57:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14230)|
| 3:57:12| The I'm inclined to go along with this on first reading to get it out there for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14232)|
| 3:57:18| because I believe it's a discussion that needs to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14238)|
| 3:57:21| But I would kind of dovetail on what Commissioner Norman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14241)|
| 3:57:23| is a lot of times we pass things and then we get into the law of unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14243)|
| 3:57:28| And I think we need to make sure that we're not going to get into unintended consequences as we look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14248)|
| 3:57:34| and should we pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14254)|
| 3:57:35| The fact that it is a ballot initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14255)|
| 3:57:37| this body has passed a resolution saying that before we could pass it on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14257)|
| 3:57:42| we would have two public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14262)|
| 3:57:44| And so, one public hearing could be at finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14264)|
| 3:57:46| One could be at intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14266)|
| 3:57:48| But we do need to weigh in with the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14268)|
| 3:57:51| I think the employee groups need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14271)|
| 3:57:53| We need to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14273)|
| 3:57:54| We need to hear from as many people as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14274)|
| 3:57:56| And so, Ms. Fogerson, I would ask that you, when we do have these hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14276)|
| 3:57:59| if you would come prepared to let us know what you think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14279)|
| 3:58:03| I appreciate very much the city's willingness to help, but this is a county civil service system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14283)|
| 3:58:08| and we need to have it as a blueprint for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14288)|
| 3:58:12| Also, Mr. Troyer, if you would come prepared to address any financial impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14292)|
| 3:58:16| any financial statements that we need to look at on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14296)|
| 3:58:19| I think that for us to completely change, and you're looking at a pretty significant change here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14299)|
| 3:58:23| that we need to know everything on these 13 pages and the impact that it would have not only now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14303)|
| 3:58:29| but in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14309)|
| 3:58:30| And I think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14310)|
| 3:58:31| So I'm going to support it on first reading so we can get it out there and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14311)|
| 3:58:34| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14314)|
| 3:58:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14317)|
| 3:58:40| I guess my question is, will this affect the fee offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14320)|
| 3:58:44| And I guess the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14324)|
| 3:58:46| It very well could, just as the amendments by the NOX 1 group may affect the fee offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14326)|
| 3:58:53| that are going to be on the ballot for November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14333)|
| 3:58:56| What this does is put it in the hands of the voters as to whether or not to have a civil service system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14336)|
| 3:59:04| And what this does is then it allows the commission the authority to create one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14344)|
| 3:59:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14354)|
| 3:59:15| Given that, being an employee of the NOX County Trustee's Office, I'm going to recuse myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14355)|
| 3:59:23| because it may have direct conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14363)|
| 3:59:26| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14366)|
| 3:59:28| I appreciate what my fellow commissioners have been saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14368)|
| 3:59:31| Commissioner Norman and Hammond there, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14371)|
| 3:59:34| it seems like we're trying to change the world in the last eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14374)|
| 3:59:37| Is anybody else from the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14377)|
| 3:59:38| You know, I'm here to gather information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14378)|
| 3:59:40| Anybody else from the administration has to tell us what's out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14380)|
| 3:59:48| Well, without question, there certainly is a physical note attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14388)|
| 3:59:51| When you look at the city of Knoxville, we don't know what all these costs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14391)|
| 3:59:54| because we just found out about this when it was placed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14394)|
| 3:59:57| But in the city, they spend $978,390 annually to run their merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14397)|
| 4:00:05| And when you look at our sheriff's department with just an office of their staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14405)|
| 4:00:11| and I think they do a real good job with the merit system, but it's three employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14411)|
| 4:00:14| and space costs and everything associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14414)|
| 4:00:16| So this does have a rather significant fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14416)|
| 4:00:19| And if you do decide to go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14419)|
| 4:00:21| I would hope you would take a look at what it's going to cost to run it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14421)|
| 4:00:24| because it certainly is not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14424)|
| 4:00:27| And when you look at the city, right at a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14427)|
| 4:00:30| that's a pretty expensive cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14430)|
| 4:00:32| We just sat here a couple of days ago working with each other trying to reduce cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14432)|
| 4:00:37| and now we're having the potential of going directly in the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14437)|
| 4:00:43| Mayor, can I ask what that million dollars covers, what that $900,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14443)|
| 4:00:48| I really don't have any idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14448)|
| 4:00:49| We got this from Mr. York on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14449)|
| 4:00:52| He said, what's the cost of your merit system or civil service system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14452)|
| 4:00:57| And we said the O-9 budget is $978,390.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14457)|
| 4:01:01| They have 13 employees and five board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14461)|
| 4:01:04| And I guess if you pass it on first reading, we could get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14464)|
| 4:01:06| We will certainly be glad to work with you to look at what it does cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14466)|
| 4:01:09| But that's just the cursory numbers that we got the very first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14469)|
| 4:01:12| To say that it doesn't cost, and I don't know that anyone has said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14472)|
| 4:01:16| but to say that it doesn't cost anything I really believe is completely not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14476)|
| 4:01:23| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14483)|
| 4:01:24| The majority of it is salaries, about $6,700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14484)|
| 4:01:27| How many employees does the city have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14487)|
| 4:01:30| Commissioner, they have 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14490)|
| 4:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14494)|
| 4:01:35| No, I'm talking about employees, the total employees that are in under that civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14495)|
| 4:01:39| We'd have substantially a lot more, wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14499)|
| 4:01:42| I would think we would, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14502)|
| 4:01:43| So I think based on the number of employees, it'd have to cost us a whole lot more, wouldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14503)|
| 4:01:49| Well, that's my first take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14509)|
| 4:01:52| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14512)|
| 4:01:53| But I would want to look at everything they're doing and compare it side by side if you decide to go that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14513)|
| 4:01:57| But I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14517)|
| 4:01:58| I think it has a heavy price tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14518)|
| 4:01:59| But if they have 13 employees, we'd have to have more, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14519)|
| 4:02:02| Probably my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14522)|
| 4:02:05| The city has 1,600, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14525)|
| 4:02:08| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14528)|
| 4:02:09| Mr. Chairman, I'm still speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| I'm still speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14531)|
| 4:02:13| Francis, I'm leaning on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14533)|
| 4:02:15| You don't need to get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14535)|
| 4:02:16| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14536)|
| 4:02:17| But I've really enjoyed working with you the last six to eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14537)|
| 4:02:19| And I highly respect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14539)|
| 4:02:21| I highly respect your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14541)|
| 4:02:22| And I think you do a Gloria Ray job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14542)|
| 4:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14545)|
| 4:02:29| That would be a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14549)|
| 4:02:31| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14551)|
| 4:02:32| You should have Gloria done a Francis job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14552)|
| 4:02:36| Yeah, I'd just like to add that I see where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14556)|
| 4:02:41| But I haven't seen or heard from any employees who are coming to me demanding either some kind of merit protection or civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14561)|
| 4:02:50| And I don't think in the years I've been here, and I've been here since 1986 working at the county as just an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14570)|
| 4:02:59| And, you know, I haven't seen no mass firings of office holders changing and anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14579)|
| 4:03:05| So just I'm a conservative Republican, and I think we need to save our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14585)|
| 4:03:09| And if it's going to be $500,000 or a million dollars, I'd like to see that money go to our schools to educate our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14589)|
| 4:03:15| if we can save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14595)|
| 4:03:17| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14597)|
| 4:03:20| Mr. Mayor, you may be the best one to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14600)|
| 4:03:23| How many employees do we have with the sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14603)|
| 4:03:29| A thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14609)|
| 4:03:30| A thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14610)|
| 4:03:31| How many employees do we have with Knox County that are not employed with the sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14611)|
| 4:03:39| About a thousand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14619)|
| 4:03:41| Two thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14621)|
| 4:03:42| Two thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14622)|
| 4:03:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14623)|
| 4:03:44| So we've got three employees with the sheriff's merit system, which is not civil service, but it's something quite similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14624)|
| 4:03:53| So what is the difference between the sheriff's department merit system and the civil service system that the city has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14633)|
| 4:04:02| And what I'm wondering is basically if we've got three employees per thousand with the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14642)|
| 4:04:10| and considerably more with the city's civil service system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14650)|
| 4:04:14| and I'm wondering if we could create something that does the job of civil service for other employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14654)|
| 4:04:20| but structure it more like the merit system that we have for the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14660)|
| 4:04:25| I'm wondering if we might be able to save some money by doing that and still create that sort of protection for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14665)|
| 4:04:33| Well, Commissioner, we may be able to save some money if you compare it to what the city spends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14673)|
| 4:04:37| But in fairness to them, I don't know what their expenses are and how they're allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14677)|
| 4:04:41| But to say you're going to save money, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14681)|
| 4:04:44| You cannot save any money by implementing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14684)|
| 4:04:46| Oh, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14686)|
| 4:04:47| I mean, I understand it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14687)|
| 4:04:49| It's not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14689)|
| 4:04:50| It's going to cost something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14690)|
| 4:04:51| And I supported this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14691)|
| 4:04:52| I co-sponsored this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14692)|
| 4:04:53| But, you know, at the time I was not considering the cost of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14693)|
| 4:04:58| And, you know, if we could do something similar to what we already have for sheriff's deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14698)|
| 4:05:03| and add maybe another two to three, four employees, it might be worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14703)|
| 4:05:09| But if it's going to cost us per employee what it costs the city, that might not be a good deal for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14709)|
| 4:05:18| I think when you look at the tight budget times and how difficult it was to cut things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14718)|
| 4:05:24| how difficult we were, how concerned we are about management, to look at adding several hundred thousand dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14724)|
| 4:05:29| and I would think that would be a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14729)|
| 4:05:31| I don't know that that may be the best use of our funds at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14731)|
| 4:05:36| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14736)|
| 4:05:38| Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14738)|
| 4:05:39| You always confuse us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14739)|
| 4:05:40| I was just looking at the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14740)|
| 4:05:41| She shaved this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14741)|
| 4:05:43| I don't understand why you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14743)|
| 4:05:46| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14746)|
| 4:05:47| I just wanted to say that I'm really interested in hearing what people have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14747)|
| 4:05:52| I'd really like to pass this on first reading so that we can have this conversation, start this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14752)|
| 4:05:57| I have had people pull me over in the city county building, but they've always done it in the shadows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14757)|
| 4:06:03| and said, thank you for bringing this forward, that they were concerned about their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14763)|
| 4:06:07| that they've had to pay for help contribute to political campaigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14767)|
| 4:06:12| and that if they couldn't pay for it all at once that they could make a payment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14772)|
| 4:06:16| And so I would really like to pass this forward just to at least have the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14776)|
| 4:06:20| and get some of these answers, find out what the costs are associated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14780)|
| 4:06:24| and really get this discussion moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14784)|
| 4:06:26| Obviously, we're talking about a ballot initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14786)|
| 4:06:28| so ultimately it would be up to the voters to decide if they choose for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14788)|
| 4:06:33| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14793)|
| 4:06:35| Does everyone understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=14795)|

| 4:11:54| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15114)|
| 4:11:57| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15117)|
| 4:11:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15118)|
| 4:11:59| I'd like to make a motion to approve this, but with some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15119)|
| 4:12:05| I think I'd really just like to change it to where we receive 45-day written notice of any interest-only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15125)|
| 4:12:10| bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15130)|
| 4:12:11| But the first part of that, I believe Commissioner Luthold, when we kind of transferred the three cents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15131)|
| 4:12:16| towards our debt service, I think that that might have taken care of some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15136)|
| 4:12:22| I just really was interested in making sure that we got more money going towards paying down our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15142)|
| 4:12:28| But I would like to see any sort of notification if we are going to have interest-only bonds that commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15148)|
| 4:12:34| is aware that we are doing that and receive written notification of that from the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15154)|
| 4:12:38| So I'd really like to just scratch the first part and leave the written notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15158)|
| 4:12:46| Commissioner Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15166)|
| 4:12:48| I appreciate Commissioner Davis bringing up the three cents, but that really doesn't do anything as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15168)|
| 4:12:58| interest-only accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15178)|
| 4:12:59| All that did, it was a wash because we moved money in and we took money out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15179)|
| 4:13:05| So it doesn't address any more money going towards our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15185)|
| 4:13:10| So we didn't add any more money to principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15190)|
| 4:13:14| So we're still where we were at when we started the whole budgetary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15194)|
| 4:13:21| I mean, she's welcome to make any motion she wants to make, but the three cents doesn't take care of adding any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15201)|
| 4:13:28| money to pay debt because we moved money out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15208)|
| 4:13:32| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15212)|
| 4:13:34| Yes, I've tried to clarify this before, but I'll address this question to the finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15214)|
| 4:13:42| But we have only one interest-only bond, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15222)|
| 4:13:45| And that's the 30 million bond that was issued either in 2006 or 2007?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15225)|
| 4:13:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15233)|
| 4:13:54| If you look at our debt schedule, the one that is most talked about is the one that was issued in conjunction with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15234)|
| 4:14:01| the sheriff's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15241)|
| 4:14:03| We had two bond issues in the same year, and what we did is we took the most expensive and taxable pension piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15243)|
| 4:14:09| and made that first and made the tax-exempt second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15249)|
| 4:14:12| And so it looks like it's interest-only, but from my perspective, it's one big bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15252)|
| 4:14:17| But that's the one when people talk about these interest-only bonds, that's what they're really referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15257)|
| 4:14:22| That's where that got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15262)|
| 4:14:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15264)|
| 4:14:26| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15266)|
| 4:14:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15268)|
| 4:14:29| John, could I ask you a question about this also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15269)|
| 4:14:32| So just respond to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15272)|
| 4:14:33| I mean, in terms of financial strategy, does this pose some kind of hardship on you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15273)|
| 4:14:38| I mean, what's your preference in terms of this kind of notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15278)|
| 4:14:42| Does it encumber you in how you handle funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15282)|
| 4:14:45| I mean, what's its effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15285)|
| 4:14:48| I think that it makes good sense to have open conversation with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15288)|
| 4:14:54| and make sure that we issue debt, only debt that the commission is comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15294)|
| 4:15:00| And I would hope that everybody would understand what kind of debt we're going to issue before we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15300)|
| 4:15:06| A 45-day notice is fine if that's what you want, but I would hope that we'd have ongoing conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15306)|
| 4:15:14| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15314)|
| 4:15:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15316)|
| 4:15:17| John, right now, when you bring a bond issue before us, do you know if you're going to get an interest-only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15317)|
| 4:15:26| or one that pays principal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15326)|
| 4:15:30| The one in question, the Series 2007 General Obligation Series, was really an exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15330)|
| 4:15:37| and that was because we had two bond issues for two different purposes issued very, very close to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15337)|
| 4:15:42| And so it's our general rule that we like to pay as much principal as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15342)|
| 4:15:47| I understand that, but that's not the question, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15347)|
| 4:15:51| My question is, are you mandated to tell us what type of bond you're going to be buying when we give you approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15351)|
| 4:15:58| Because I don't remember when, I mean, I could be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15358)|
| 4:16:02| but I don't remember you coming before us and saying, this bond is going to be an interest-only bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15362)|
| 4:16:10| Usually, the bond resolutions leave the amortization schedule later to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15370)|
| 4:16:18| One of the things that we do is we analyze the market and try to make sure that what we offer to the market is going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15378)|
| 4:16:24| the best interest rate that we can, and that's an ongoing discussion that we have and we monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15384)|
| 4:16:30| When you bring a bond issue to us, do you usually know which kind of bond you're going to be asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15390)|
| 4:16:36| or going out to the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15396)|
| 4:16:39| Very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15399)|
| 4:16:41| Well, I think it would be a good idea that when we do get a motion to go out and buy bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15401)|
| 4:16:49| that the resolution includes whether it's going to be an interest-only or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15409)|
| 4:16:55| I think we as commissioners need to be part of that process as to whether or not it should be interest-only or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15415)|
| 4:17:04| and have a say-so in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15424)|
| 4:17:06| I think it's important for the commission to understand exactly what we're going to issue at the same time we issue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15426)|
| 4:17:12| So, I guess, I don't know if I need to substitute motion or make a substitute motion that all bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15432)|
| 4:17:24| resolutions that they let us know what type of bond they're going to be going out into the market to get the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15444)|
| 4:17:32| whether it's going to be an interest-only or if it's going to be a regular bond that pays off over a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15452)|
| 4:17:38| so that we have the details of that bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15458)|
| 4:17:41| Do you want to just make that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15461)|
| 4:17:42| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15462)|
| 4:17:45| Commissioner Pinkson seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15465)|
| 4:17:47| Is there any question or discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15467)|
| 4:17:49| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15469)|
| 4:17:51| On the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15471)|
| 4:17:54| Not on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15474)|
| 4:17:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15476)|
| 4:17:57| I'm going to let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15477)|
| 4:17:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15478)|
| 4:17:59| My question was going to be that we have a lot of debt, and some of it is interest-only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15479)|
| 4:18:05| and some of it is paying off on principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15485)|
| 4:18:11| But the way this is written in the original motion was the purpose of paying down debt on interest-only bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15491)|
| 4:18:19| If the interest-only bond, Mr. Troyer, if the interest-only bond is a lower interest rate than some of the other things that we're paying off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15499)|
| 4:18:31| and since we're not paying it all off next month, we would be better to pay the interest-only bond last if the interest rate was less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15511)|
| 4:18:40| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15520)|
| 4:18:41| And that's why we set it up exactly that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15521)|
| 4:18:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15523)|
| 4:18:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15524)|
| 4:18:45| So I don't see that we're gaining anything by paying off bonds that are cheap first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15525)|
| 4:18:55| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15535)|
| 4:18:56| Actually, that was the point I was going to try to make is that it seems like that we would be financially better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15536)|
| 4:19:03| to leave the interest-only bond alone until we pay off the highest, you know, the higher interest rate bond first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15543)|
| 4:19:12| In other words, I would argue to leave it like it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15552)|
| 4:19:15| I would support the motion, the substitute motion that Commissioner Luthor made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15555)|
| 4:19:20| because I think we do need to know if there's going to be an interest-only bond issued and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15560)|
| 4:19:24| It may be physically sound to do that, but I think we would like to know that if that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15564)|
| 4:19:30| But, you know, I think for that reason, I probably would want to oppose the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15570)|
| 4:19:36| Commissioner Luthor, you're live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15576)|
| 4:19:38| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15578)|
| 4:19:40| I just think it is prudent to allow commissioners to know what kind of bond we're going to be issuing and, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15580)|
| 4:19:49| it may be more prudent to have an interest-only that's out there for a reason to take advantage of sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15589)|
| 4:19:55| But other times, you need to have, you want your bonds, you want to be paying them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15595)|
| 4:20:00| I think, you know, my whole idea about debt is you want to pay it off as quickly as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15600)|
| 4:20:07| so you pay less interest in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15607)|
| 4:20:09| So I think we need to be a part of that decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15609)|
| 4:20:14| What's your motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15614)|
| 4:20:15| That we are to be notified what type of bond it's going to be, whether it's an interest-only or if it's a regular 20-year bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15615)|
| 4:20:27| that has principal and interest, and that is to be part of the information we receive through the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15627)|
| 4:20:34| What about the five days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15634)|
| 4:20:36| Well, whenever we receive that information, I mean, we can act on it when we, in a meeting or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15636)|
| 4:20:45| We can always defer any item 30 days or 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15645)|
| 4:20:49| I just think as long as we have notification, we feel comfortable with it, then we should be able to act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15649)|
| 4:20:54| If we don't feel comfortable, we can vote it down or defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15654)|
| 4:21:00| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15660)|
| 4:21:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15662)|
| 4:21:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15663)|
| 4:21:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15664)|
| 4:21:05| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15665)|
| 4:21:08| Break until 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15668)|
| 4:21:09| We'll start zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part1?start=15669)|
