| 0:00:43| with liberty and justice for all. I don't think we have any elected officials here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=43)|
| 0:00:52| Do we have anyone in the audience? I do want to welcome Boy Scout PAC 154. They're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=52)|
| 0:01:01| this afternoon to receive, to work on credit for their citizenship and community badges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=61)|
| 0:01:06| so welcome. A couple of announcements. Our next policy review meeting has been scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=66)|
| 0:01:12| for Wednesday, November 20th at 1 p.m. in the Andrew Johnson Building. An agenda packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| will be distributed in the next few days. Also, just a reminder that Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| will be closed for the Thanksgiving holidays, November 27th through the 29th, and on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| of the Board, I'd like to wish all our students and families and staff a wonderful holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=88)|
| 0:01:36| Are there any requested changes to the agenda? Thank you, Madam Chair. We talked about moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=96)|
| 0:01:46| the item number 13, which was about the naming of facilities, to the policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=106)|
| 0:01:54| I'd like to request that we do that. Okay, we have a second. Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=114)|
| 0:02:04| Yes, with all due respect, I really do struggle with this. This is an issue that our school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=124)|
| 0:02:21| especially during the season, would very much like to move forward with. I might remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| the group, we just had a naming of our public defender's office last week after employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| so this is not something that's changing what hasn't already occurred many times. So I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=154)|
| 0:02:42| request that this be brought to a vote, this postponement. Any additional comments? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=162)|
| 0:02:55| Do you have a comment? Ms. Pab? I would just like to comment. I think that Tony has a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| point, but I think what I would like to see us is go ahead and vote on this item, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| bring it up for discussion for future namings so that people know that there's a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| in place when it comes up in the future. I agree with that. I don't think it's fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| at this date to kick this to policy review when a school has plans to go forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| something that is currently one of our policies. So I would agree that we should consider this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| evening and then move the policy to policy review for further discussion. Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=207)|
| 0:03:37| Okay, so what are we doing? Are we voting first about whether to move it to policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| and then next about whether to do it or not? Is that what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| That's what we're doing. So we would vote on your motion to move it, move this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| to policy review. Okay. And if that motion carries, it would move to policy review. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| it fails, then we will vote on that item tonight. Okay. Okay. Any other comments? Okay. Do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=240)|
| 0:04:08| need a roll call vote then? Okay. We'll have a roll call vote. Ms. Coney, please. And this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| will be yes to move it. Yes to move it to policy review. No would mean that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=254)|
| 0:04:22| vote on this item this evening. Okay. Is that clear? Yes. Okay. Ms. Satterfield? No. Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=262)|
| 0:04:32| Owen? Yes. Mr. Norman? Yes. Ms. Babb? No. Ms. Hill? No. Ms. Bounds? No. Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=272)|
| 0:04:42| Yes. Ms. Christie? No. Ms. Horne? No. Okay. So there were six no votes, so we will vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=282)|
| 0:04:55| on this item this evening. And we will consider that policy at our next policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=295)|
| 0:05:09| Are there any additional changes to the agenda? Okay. Do I have a motion to approve? So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| Second. Okay. Any discussion? All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Okay. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=316)|

| 0:17:14| We have a motion by Ms. Christie and a second by Ms. Hill. I couldn't tell who said it. Any discussion? All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1034)|
| 0:17:29| 12B, Approved Intergovernmental Memorandum of Understanding with Knox County regarding the design and construction of a new Lonsdale Elementary School. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1049)|
| 0:17:39| We have a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Ms. Owen. Discussion? Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Dillingham, I would like to, I'm sorry I didn't get with you today, but I would like to ask you a couple more questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1065)|
| 0:17:59| And again, for the people that hadn't been here, we talked about the program standards for the new buildings that are being, the new schools being built, and there's some revisions in the pipeline for some of these standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1079)|
| 0:18:14| So that's my question, I guess, Doug, is when, will the board, the revisions that have been reviewed by Brad Salisbury, will the board have those back in front of them anytime soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1094)|
| 0:18:32| And will we then be asked to approve those, the new program standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you, Mr. Norman. After discussion with Mr. Oaks, we have determined that we do not feel like that they are substantive enough to require board action on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1120)|
| 0:18:54| Our program standards are guidelines that we give to all of our designers as they are designing schools, but they're not definitive. Most of them are not definitive to the point that they are actual requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1134)|
| 0:19:09| We will take a look at just about anything that an architect proposes to see if we feel like it meets board policy as far as long-term maintenance is concerned, and security and safety to children, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1149)|
| 0:19:25| So based on the modifications that have been proposed, as far as the storm drainage portion is concerned, they're fairly general requirements that I think we can implement and control during the design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1165)|
| 0:19:45| Okay, good. And so for the people that aren't here, these are the people that are not familiar with this process. Knox County engineering and engineers within the department have been reviewing those standards and trying to modify the standards somewhat with two objectives in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1185)|
| 0:20:07| One being sort of the drainage aspects and making those as environmentally sound as they can be. And then the other one is the campus itself and making the area outside the building as amenable to education and environmental practices as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1207)|
| 0:20:32| So it's a way, it essentially is a way to get kids out of the building into some educational spaces which are now on the campus. So we're trying to build those into the design process and then get those implemented. So that's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1232)|
| 0:20:51| And I will add that all of this is kind of in conjunction with the federal mandate for the Clean Water Act that was implemented a few years ago. So we're trying to move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1251)|
| 0:21:06| Okay, very good. And then my last question is who's the representative that will be the person who looks at compliance with all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1266)|
| 0:21:19| Let me think, that would probably be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| Thank you, Mr. Dillingham. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Mr. Dillingham, my question may also be for you, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| It's minor. I'm looking at the, for board members if you're looking at it, I'm looking at the fourth whereas. And we list several schools there, but then toward the end of the paragraph we say and the most recent middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1290)|
| 0:21:44| And that seems kind of odd to me to list several and then suddenly not. So I'd like to ask that we either include the names of those two schools or possibly leave out all the names so that it would be a little more, I don't know, a little more consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1304)|
| 0:22:04| Mr. Oaks, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| Yes, ma'am. I would think if you want to do that the board can make a motion to amend that and then we can make that amendment and provide it to county commission for them to vote on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1328)|
| 0:22:22| It's also on their agenda as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| Mr. Dupler, do we need to do that if it doesn't change the meaning of the MOU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Owen. I think if you all are making a change at this point it would be good to vote on it, but I would also say that legally it's not going to change the actual meaning of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1352)|
| 0:22:47| But if you want to say add the two middle schools by name, I would say when you vote on it just make an amended motion to add those two names and then that would be the easiest and most official way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1367)|
| 0:23:06| Okay. And that's not likely to change the outcome of their vote, would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| No. I mean, you know, I think right now, I mean, it just mentions the two middle schools, just not by name. So, I mean, the meaning of the document is not changing at all, but I mean, I think since we're at this point, go ahead and make it official that that's what you want to do and make it an amended motion to approve with the two names, which would be Hardin Valley Middle and Gibbs Middle specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1393)|
| 0:23:37| All right. I was just having an English teacher moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| Can we finish our discussion and then if you would like to entertain a motion, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Yeah, and I don't know if this question is for Mr. Dillingham or Mr. Norman because Mr. Norman just seems to know a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| I was just curious when you're talking about outdoor space, are they talking about like outdoor classrooms or what specifically? I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1430)|
| 0:23:58| I guess the intent is just to look at the space from the beginning of the design process to maximize any opportunity outside, be it educational, outdoor classroom, trees, you know, preserving mature hardwood trees, all these kind of things that just make the space, the outdoor space, much better for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1438)|
| 0:24:27| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| OK, Ms. Ebede, you, Ms. Ebede, Ms. Satterfield, you made the motion. Would you, would you like to make a substitute motion based on the conversation? Or Ms. Owen can, but Ms. Satterfield made the motion and Ms. Owen seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1469)|
| 0:24:45| Oh, I should make a motion to amend and then she could accept it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| All right. Then I'd like to make a motion to include the names of our two middle schools, Hardin Valley Middle School and Gibbs Middle School in the fourth paragraph, if that is a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1493)|
| 0:25:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Is that acceptable? OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| And so, is that acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| OK, so now we're voting on the amended motion and then we'll vote on the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| OK, so any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| OK, and now, go ahead Ms. Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| And then the original motion of approving this memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| And we have, do we have to do a first and a second on that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| OK, so we already have a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| Do we have additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| Is everybody good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| If there's no further discussion, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| Item 12C, accept charter school monitoring reports for Emerald Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| OK, we have a motion by Mr. Norman, a second by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Yes, we have, is Steve here or some representative from Emerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| Mr. Diggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you for being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| Hey, Steve, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| Sorry about last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| I wasn't prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| I'm a little better prepared this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| I did have, first I wanted to, I talked to the research, our research folks that looked at some of your stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1605)|
| 0:26:54| and some of your results, and just wanted to commend you, first of all, about the reading, third grade reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1614)|
| 0:27:06| and the achievement that you all have made in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| I mean, Clint, the person I talked to in research, he was like flabbergasted that it was so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1631)|
| 0:27:21| And so I just want to commend you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| I think the number he gave was 41% of third graders were either on level or above mastery, whatever the term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1645)|
| 0:27:36| Above grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Above grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| And so that's in comparison to, you know, some of the schools over, the urban schools that had 10%, 8%, not call any names or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1658)|
| 0:27:50| But these are just very significant improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| So I don't know what you're doing, but we need to find out, and we need to pass that around, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1674)|
| 0:28:03| So first, just thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| And then the questions that I have in the first part of the report, you did have some mention of a couple items that I'm interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1686)|
| 0:28:16| One, you listed suspension rate, student attrition rate, teacher retention rate, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1696)|
| 0:28:27| So how do you feel about, I think the student attrition rate is almost negligible, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1707)|
| 0:28:37| There's very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| No, we've, I don't have that number in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| I don't see on what that student retention or attrition rate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| But while she's correcting it, why don't you just come on down, Chrissy, if you don't care as well, since you have the data with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| I will just say to you first, backing up, we are encouraged about the third grade reading scores in Algebra I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| Eighth grade Algebra I really outperformed KCS average and the state average as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| And I'd be amiss today, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| She's here with the district now, but Renee Kelly was the school director with us last year with these results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| So we have to give her thanks and appreciation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| And our interim school director, who's on her way, was the third and fourth grade dean of curriculum and instruction last year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1760)|
| 0:29:30| So we want to recognize Lauren Moore as well for their leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| So they would be the ones that need to answer how did it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| But we've had some good conversation that's begun, too, with our school liaison to talk about how we ensure that we're collaborating with the district to share best practices and learn from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1778)|
| 0:29:51| So we're very much wanting that to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| You know, we hope we can keep proving this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| We pray so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| And we do have that desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| If there's something that we can learn or that can be learned from us, we want to share that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| But we recognize, and what you're hitting on, is we have to get the next piece for us, which our consultants tell us will be the most difficult to really sustain academic results and get higher results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1805)|
| 0:30:19| is getting the culture where we want it to be and really ensuring that we have that in place, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1819)|
| 0:30:27| with having the strong teacher core and keeping low attrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| And same with our scholar population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| And also suspensions are higher than what we would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| But we know this year, after spending a year with bringing some folks in to try to help us put together a strong scholar support plan, already this year our suspensions are quite lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1838)|
| 0:30:50| So, again, we think the culture is moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| But we've been clear in that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| We have a ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| We recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| And I think that's something for the demographic and the urban schools everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| That's something we all work hard on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| And we hope to be able to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| About the other item, teacher retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Yeah, teacher retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| I will tell you on that one, too, and we recognize, too, something that's been difficult and challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| We're glad that both Dr. Roswick and Renee Kelly were found, you know, had the positions here in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| But we have to begin there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| We have to get our school director in place and keep someone there for a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| And so in four years, we had two school directors and we have an interim in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| So that is our number one issue right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| Sure, we have a leader and have that leader in place for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| That also helps bring security and stability with the teachers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| We have really studied, researched this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| And I would tell you that while we are not pleased with our teacher attrition by no means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| our board is focused on that at every monthly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| It's actually lower than comparable schools in the state and across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| Unfortunately, in Tennessee, teacher turnover in the Achievement School District actually averages 57%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| We were at 51%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| In teacher attrition in urban schools across the country, we know it's as much as 66%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1945)|
| 0:32:32| Again, no matter what these other areas have, we're not satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| and we're going to do better than what we have in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Also, we know this, that charter schools operating less than five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| have a higher attrition rate than those that operate five or more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| And we're in number five this year, so we hope that we get to turn the tide as well in a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| What I am encouraged about is in the midst of the attrition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| we have really recruited some very high-talented, high-quality teachers that are in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| dedicated, working hard, and our attendance rate right now for teachers is 95%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| And it would be higher without some of the attrition that we have experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| So remember that our teachers also are working a longer school year, a longer school day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| and that makes it difficult for us in keeping our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| After a while, there's those that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| I want to go with a shorter school year and a shorter school day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| and we understand it's not for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| but it makes it a little bit tougher to find the person to stay with us in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| But we think that longer school year and a longer school day is one of the critical reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| we're seeing some of our achievement results at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| But it does pose a challenge for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Any other questions or comments for Mr. Diggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| And just so everyone knows, we did discuss all of these items last week at our work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| and that's why we've moved through rather rapidly this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| And now we will turn to Ms. Fab for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| Vivian Shipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| And please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| Vivian Shipe, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| I come before you tonight to ask you to be brave enough to not open the Pandora's box of the unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| The box is entitled The Bible Release Time Project Presented by the Elgin Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| Now, on the surface, it seems innocent enough, the goal being to give children biblical instruction one hour per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| The three requirements of written permission by a parent, off school grounds, and no government fund use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| make it seem even more tempting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| But when you crack that lid a little bit, just as Pandora did, the first thing out of that box is access to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2113)|
| 0:35:23| The school day belongs fully to the education of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| Are we making too much of this possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Are we making too much of protecting the minds and spirits of our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| I say no, we're not making too much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| There is great accountability attached to the school hours in a 24-hour day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| From the moment our children step into that kindergarten classroom until 12 years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| they boldly stride across the platform to graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| We, us, and you are the guardians, the overseers, and the caretakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| Exactly how would one hour work anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| You have to allow transport time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Who is transporting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Are they vetted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Are they insured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Is that one hour inclusive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| How many children are leaving school at different times of the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| When it's too many, too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| If we let in one organization, we must let in all organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| And what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Does this mean any religious group can now be created and come and take our children off-site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| Remember Jonestown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Even more important, what about test times, IEPs, resource-needed classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| One bad apple can spoil a whole system of good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| This is more than Engle versus Vitale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| This is more than Zarek versus Clawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| And this is much deeper than the issues raised by Madeline O'Hare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| The mission and operational philosophy of our Knox County schools is to provide a safe and secure environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| and place our children in the best possible position to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| Our country is number one out of 40 in the world in the ranking of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| We as a country are not even in the top ten, and we rank number three in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Our children do not need to leave school for any other reason than to go home at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| having been taught and nurtured to the best of our abilities for those precious school hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| As we tell our children, just say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Thank you, Madam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| We do not have board forum this evening, but Ms. Hill has requested to say a couple of words about our wonderful student representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| So, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Just a moment of privilege, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Two weeks ago when we were – a lot of us were at what for some of us turned out to be the last football game of the season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2268)|
| 0:37:58| If you'll recall, it was raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| It was horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| It was just horrendous out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| And Carnes High School, probably like some other high schools, their band did not dress out, did not march,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| didn't have their instruments out because of the bad weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| Well, that did turn out to be our last football game, unlike some others in this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| But the decision was made that the following Friday night that the band would have a band night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| And it was at 630, and it was just going to be the band doing their halftime performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2309)|
| 0:38:39| I think the feeling was that it would just be a handful of people that would come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| I was very proud to report that the stands, in fact, were packed to watch our band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| It was probably about 25 degrees that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| It was a freezing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| But at any rate, I just wanted to commend Noah Kelly, who is on the screen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2337)|
| 0:39:09| marching as our proud drum major in his last event, leading the march for Carnes High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2349)|
| 0:39:18| We were just very proud to see him out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| And when I saw him and thought, oh, he's one of us here on the board, it made me very proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| So thank you, Noah, and thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| And thank you, Carnes High School band, for having that extra event so that our band students could have their last march.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2370)|
| 0:39:43| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| Thank you, Ms. Hill, for ending on a nice, happy note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| That's wonderful news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| And we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2389)|
| 0:40:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard264191127nov13?start=2414)|
