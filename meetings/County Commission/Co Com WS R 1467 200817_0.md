| 0:01:09| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| All right. Thank you everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Commissioner Busler, would you lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| We may have some folks watching this meeting from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| and we may even have some folks here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| This might be the first time that you've ever attended a county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| I just want to give a little bit of big-picture insight into how the meetings work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| and also why we have two meetings each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| This is considered the work session of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| and then next week will be the official Board of Commissioners meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| At the work session meeting, it's our first walk through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| We have got a number of items on our agenda for this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| which are fairly routine that will stay on our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| And then tonight we will do our first pass through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| Some items will be briefly reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Some will be debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Some will be placed on the consent agenda with the other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| And then next week, at next week's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| the items that are on the consent agenda for both the Knox County operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| as well as the school will all be approved with one vote per consent degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| And then items that have been sent forward out of this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| with a motion for no recommendation will be actually voted on at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| So that's just a little bit of the basics of kind of how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| why we have two meetings and what is usually on the agenda for each meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| Tonight we have the first thing on our agenda is going to be public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| After that, we will set the rest of the agenda for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| I want to let my fellow commissioners know that we have had a handful of additions come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| both today and Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| So the first draft of the agenda will be changed somewhat with the addition of a couple of items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| that have come in as recent as today, which when we get to that point on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| I'll make sure that we review them with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| So moving on, I also have, looking at those who have signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| I have two citizens who have called about illegal dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| Commissioner Beeler has brought that item to us as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| So after we conclude with the public forum and begin to move through our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| we've been trying to get to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| I know, I think it's been about four or five months on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| So that will be an item that I will pull from the discussion at the bottom of the list up to the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| just to knock out that discussion, and then we'll proceed from that to the rest of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| So just an FYI, that's why the two citizens who signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| they're both on that item, and we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| And I believe that's Ken Simpson and Dr. Vada Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Was that yours, Mr. Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Yes, those are the constituents that signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Is Mr. Simpson here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| If you are here, wave at us if you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| We're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Okay, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Well, we will have those two speak when we get to that discussion item, which is actually on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| So now I'll move on to regular public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| And the first citizen on the public forum is Mr. Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| And Mr. Hill, if you're here, okay, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| Just when you get to the podium, sir, just make sure you're close enough to the mic that we can hear you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| and just state your name and address for the record, and you'll have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| My name is Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| I live at 509 Cambridge Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| Commissioners, I am here today to ask you to place on the agenda of the upcoming meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| removal of the appointed members of the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| Under the county charter and state law, as confirmed by the county law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| the county commission has full authority to remove appointed members of the county board of health for cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| Therefore, because the board has issued sweeping mandates that have negatively impacted the livelihoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| and freedoms of Knox County citizens, a significant portion of citizens have lost faith in this institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| And the only remedy is a radical change in its membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| Allow me to quote from an article in the New England Journal of Medicine and Dr. Fauci on CNN.com from the journal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| Later on, it says the chance of catching COVID-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=365)|
| 0:06:13| We're wearing these masks over anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| And later, the article states that it is also clear the masks serve symbolic roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| Dr. Fauci affirms that same notion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| And in the interview, when he says, I want to make it be a symbol for people to be clear so that no one accuses me of twisting their words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=386)|
| 0:06:34| These are all people who would say we should wear masks publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| However, it does not change the facts of the statements by these professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| Acknowledging masks serve a symbolic purpose to communicate an idea more than they function to prevent the spread of a pathogen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=405)|
| 0:06:53| So in attempting to force me to engage in a symbolic practice, the board is attempting, and by evidence of me standing here with this mask, succeeding in requiring speech from a free citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=413)|
| 0:07:06| Furthermore, it is suggested making restrictions on our freedom of assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=426)|
| 0:07:17| Thankfully, they withdrew from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| In fact, the board is not comprised of legal experts and cannot properly understand the legality or illegality of a mandate that effectively acts as an ordinance of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=439)|
| 0:07:30| The county law director, the one with that charge, advised and was ignored by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| These infractions and ignorance of the law on the part of the board, under the tenure of this county commission, demands action by this present county commission so that our newly seated county commission in September can begin with a clean slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=456)|
| 0:07:50| Even if the measures of this board are in the best interest when a significant portion of the public are suspect of the board's intent or credibility, then the public concern undercuts the ability for the measures to properly function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=470)|
| 0:08:05| If our local decisions are processed through a legislative process, then certainly not everyone will be satisfied by the outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=485)|
| 0:08:18| But by the virtue of constitutional consensus, the public can have more confidence in its ability to, via the ballot box, affect change to policy that may in time prove unnecessary or unpopular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=498)|
| 0:08:32| What will happen if the commission removes the appointed members in next week's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| Well, the following day, we will still have a functioning board of health, by virtue of the members mandated to serve on the board by the state statute, the county mayor, the designee of the superintendent, and the health director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=516)|
| 0:08:49| As evidenced by previous votes, it would seem all current mandates would technically be maintained until the smaller board deems them unnecessary or the newly formed board deems them unnecessary, which will take time to form that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=529)|
| 0:09:04| The new commission would be the one approving the new members, and in the new approval process, the commission can ascertain the philosophy of the medical board as to whether legislative bodies or appointed bureaucrats should exercise the power of establishing sweeping regulatory controls on the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=544)|
| 0:09:26| It could be that a new board might recommend and convince the new commission to institute a continued mask ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| The difference would be that this ordinance would have followed a legislative process consistent with representative democracy, thereby restoring the public's confidence in our local institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=574)|
| 0:09:47| If we do not make this stand, then we are effectively inviting a future board to mandate something such as public drug testing, because if you look at the opioid issue versus overdose drug deaths this year versus COVID-19, we have a far bigger health crisis with drug abuse than we do COVID-19 in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=587)|
| 0:10:11| Liberty is not taken away in giant steps, but rather through a series of baby steps, one after another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Okay, next on the list is Mr. Pete Easton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| Mr. Easton, if you could – yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| Just state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=632)|

| 0:11:51| The masks are questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=711)|

| 0:11:59| The data has also – that has been used by the health board – has also been duplicated by their own admittance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=719)|

| 0:12:24| That's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=744)|

| 0:12:40| Next, it's Ms. Julie Hassman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=760)|
| 0:12:54| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| My name is Julie Hassman, and I live at 8310 Jadewood Lane here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| And I actually have only been in Knoxville for four months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| I moved from the state of California and have embraced Tennessee since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| And when this mandate was issued, it was very, very concerning for me, especially coming from California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=795)|
| 0:13:24| So I was asked to help create a petition, which I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| And from this petition, Kevin and Peter both began investigating and getting some even more information for us after this petition was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=811)|
| 0:13:47| This petition was created on just Friday, and I have a copy here that I'll leave for everyone to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=827)|
| 0:14:00| Since Friday, we have over 650 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| And I just thought it would be important for you to know what your citizens out there are saying and thinking, because they signed this petition wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=846)|
| 0:14:19| And we will keep the petition going because we think it's important to know how many people out there are feeling this way and what they're feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=859)|
| 0:14:30| So I just picked a few comments from different citizens just to give you an idea of what is being felt out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=870)|
| 0:14:40| The first one is, the board members that are appointed by commission must be removed and new ones appointed to be made a reflection of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=880)|
| 0:14:53| They must also understand that they are not elected and cannot make laws or mandates on citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| That is unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| While I appreciate the Board of Health giving recommendations, I cannot feel they should be able to close businesses or give mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=904)|
| 0:15:13| I would prefer that that be left for our Mayor Jacobs to decide or our elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| Those of us with breathing issues are struggling as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| Stores who follow the mandate make it impossible for us to conduct our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| It has greatly affected my mental health and physical health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=930)|

| 0:15:55| The masks are making people sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=955)|

| 0:16:02| Forcing people who work outside to wear masks is beyond ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| The spokesperson for Knox County Health Department said you had to have contact for seven minutes or longer for the virus to effectively spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=967)|

| 0:16:25| I still do not personally know anyone who has been hospitalized from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| I do know four people who have been hospitalized for drug-resistant bacterial upper respiratory infections, and one of those people did die, not COVID-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=989)|
| 0:16:40| These mandates have done great harm to my small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| My husband has also permanently lost his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1004)|

| 0:17:43| Masks do more harm than good and should never be mandated for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| Masks, shutdowns, isolations, and quarantines do not allow us to develop natural herd immunity and the reason more people are getting infected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1067)|

| 0:30:21| Are there any other changes to the non-consent agenda that you guys would like to have pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Motion to add what needs to be added and what needs to be added on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| So, I'll take that motion as motion to set the agenda with the adds and the pulls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1837)|

| 0:30:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1840)|

| 0:30:56| up Commissioner Beeler's item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| So, could I have a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1862)|

| 0:31:04| I have a motion from, that was Commissioner Gill, and I heard from over here, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| that was, was that Commissioner Gill with the motion with the second from Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1872)|

| 0:31:17| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Now, the first item that I'd like to bring up is actually a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| Commissioner Beeler, I'm going to look to you for this, to lead this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| I'd like to ask Mr. Ken Simpson and Dr. Scott, please, to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| These were the residents that contacted me several months ago about the problem of illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| littering on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| I know this is not new to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| I know this is an issue that County Commission has discussed more than once probably in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| past before I came on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| But it is a problem in multiple areas, especially in rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| I've had other constituents contact me since Mr. Simpson first reached out that have problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| with littering that include large items, sometimes refrigerators and stoves and all sorts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| And I just think it's a difficult situation, but I'd love to perhaps get Mr. Snowden to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| weigh in and, I don't know, at the Chair's discretion at some point, get the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| to work on some ways that the county can help with this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| It's difficult because it's on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| But Mr. Simpson and Dr. Scott, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| And I'd like to afford you the opportunity to address the commission about your thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| on this and your issues you've had with your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| I know you've got a lot of important things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| But I wanted to let you know that we have been picking up all kinds of garbage on Hill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| We live at 8821 Hill Road, and it is out in a very rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| We've lived there for 24 years, and we've picked up garbage there, everything from refrigerators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| to sinks to just trash and bottles and medicine bottles and syringes and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| And I do that every week or two because I don't want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| It is so disheartening to me that people in this community don't value it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| and appreciate the beauty of the area that we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| But the fact is, is they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| And so I'm here to ask for your help and your advice for what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| We'll continue to pick that garbage up if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| But like you said, it is a wide-sweeping problem that I wish there was a way that we could help control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| I don't know if signs would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| I don't know if education would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| But we are willing to participate and do whatever we can to help make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| We're not going to fix the problem, but to actually just help make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| And so that's why we're here, to appeal to you for your help and advice on what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| Well, one person I'm going to look to just for some general insight, I know this will require some follow-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| and I haven't said it recently for a while there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| I think I once told my friend, Commissioner Daley, that when I think of trash, I think of Carson Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| And I mean that as a term of endearment, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| But we had a very similar individual problem with a property in his district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| and has worked a lot on it on some of the greenways and some of the more litter-related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| He did have one big issue in his district that was a private area that was being used as a public dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| Commissioner, do you mind if I look to you just to maybe insight questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| And then as we move forward, this next commission, if you all want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| it will be up to the next commission if you want to do a little subcommittee or follow-up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| But I'm sure that would be a good area for perhaps both of you all to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| I see the law, Deputy Law Director Daniel back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| Daniel and I are working on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| And, of course, I can't say anything unless I sunshine it, but we are working on it, changing the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| I'll tell you the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| The problem is, number one, we don't have an environmental officer that will go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| We need four environmental officers, one for the south, one for the east, one for the north, and one for the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| We need an environmental officer to go out there and investigate and write a citation to these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| Secondly, we need an attorney general's office, which we have support from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| She will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Sharm Allen is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| She will prosecute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| But we've got to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| And the third thing we've got to have, the most important third thing we've got to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| is a judge that will sentence them and fine them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| And in 2020, I'm going to go ahead and make the statement now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| In 2020, we've got the judges are up for election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| And the judges don't want to sentence shoplifters, misdemeanor crimes to community service shoplifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2162)|
| 0:36:11| Let's find some judges that will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| There's nothing wrong with going out there and picking up litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| I can promise you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| If I'm 17, 18 years old, and I shoplift or throw litter out the window and get caught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| and I spend three days in the hot sun picking up litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| I'm not going to shoplift that $35 ticket or video game or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| It's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| So I tried to get Ben in contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| I went to a seminar, Keep Sevierville Beautiful and Keep Knoxville Beautiful, and the subject is litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| That's all the subject was, was litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Met a gentleman there, Officer Glennis Munday from Campbell County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| They hired him in 19—this is what could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| They hired him in 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| There were 702 or 709 illegal dumps in Campbell County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| Today, there's only about two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| First thing he did right after he was hired, he went and got the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| He put the judge in his truck, and he started driving around, and he started—the judge said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| I've seen all the dumps I want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| You start writing them up, and we'll take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| Since 1992, they went from 702 illegal dumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| Now they're only down to two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| He will write tickets through the state, which we all seen people going to the convenience center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| and trash blowing out of the back of their truck and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| If we can get an officer to write a ticket on the state level, that's $850 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| $500 of it is a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| The rest of it goes to the court cost and to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| That's—and my gosh, my county deputies on Saturday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| their hands will be cramped from writing tickets for people who are not obeying the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| and it's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| I feel your pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| For dumping on your property, private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| if we have an environmental officer, we have a DA that's willing to prosecute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| and we have a judge that will sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| all it takes is you to get a picture of that truck or that car, their license plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| you've got evidence that they've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| Then we get that environmental officer to investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| and the environmental officer goes out and says, hey, you were seen illegal dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| Of course, the first thing they're going to do, they're going to say it wasn't me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| So they'll argue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| There's a big fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| Daniel sent me an email today that if you report someone for illegal dumping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| and you get caught, there's a reward out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Fifty bucks, I think it is, and it might go a little bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| I don't care about the reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| I just want people to quit dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Quit dumping on my road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| Cover your truck, trash, when you go to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I appreciate you so much for picking up litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| I mean, it's just—I pick up litter every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| The only day I probably don't pick up litter is on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| And I will pick it up on Sunday if I have to go out somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| and I'm in the parking lot, I will pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| Well, I appreciate your time and your support in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| It's not infrequent that we would find names on a medicine bottle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| or a bank statement or a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| I mean, we know oftentimes who does this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| Yeah, and the state law says that if your name is on that paper, you're responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| And Daniel and I are going to work on one that I'm tired of seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| We buy houses posted on telephone poles, Mosquito Joe's in the right-of-ways and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| That's illegal, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| You ain't supposed to be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| So we start finding them $50 for every sign they put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| Guess what they're going to quit doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| They're going to quit littering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| An apple core is litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| A cigarette butt is litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| A banana peel is litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| A beer can, and I hate to say this, but a Weigel's cup because it's got the big Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| We all know if I owned a convenience store, I wouldn't have a logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| I really wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| Donald's logo or any type of logo because when I'm going, and you too, you go through there, you go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| they've been to Weigel's and they throw it on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| I could keep on going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| I apologize, but Daniel and I are working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| I would love to get your address and your phone number so I can keep you all informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| and I really do appreciate you picking up the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| We still have a couple other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker and then Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| I'm not familiar with Hill Road until just now, but are you north or south of Raccoon Valley Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| We're south of Raccoon Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| So, I mean, is it just because in there, can't they go to the pay landfill off of Raccoon Valley Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| I think there's a very nice one there in Halls that's paved, kept clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| but the people that we have caught doing this say that I don't have time to go to the dump and put it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2482)|
| 0:41:31| and this is just easier to drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Just a little FYI, the state actually has a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| You can text them the make of the vehicle, the license plate number, when it occurred, where it occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| and they'll actually mail them a bag, a trash bag, ashtray, all kinds of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| and then there's also an opportunity for them to be punishable by a fine of $1,500 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| So, that's on the state's website, tn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| You can find it under there, and that's a valuable tool that I know a lot of people have used recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| We have contacted them, and it comes down to being a state road or a highway patrol does the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2535)|
| 0:42:24| Caught a guy from South Carolina dumping some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| I took his tag, called State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| As you mentioned, they said we can't do anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| We only do State of Tennessee, so people from Virginia and Kentucky can come through and trash our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| and we can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Commissioner Beeler, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| I just wanted to thank Mr. Simpson and Dr. Scott for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| We will stay in touch with you, and we will get to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| I may, if it pleases the body, just I know we've got some folks here I saw from the merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| so I'd like to go ahead and jump to item number 62 before we start working through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| That is a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Now, this is the work session, so the only motion that will be acceptable will be to send this forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| because any readings happen actually at next week's meeting, but I did want to bring this one back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| I know Sheriff Spangler is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| There are some representatives from the Merit System Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| but I did want to go ahead and kind of knock that one out just because I think I saw Jim in the back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2614)|
| 0:43:42| so we could send him home if he needed to make some dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| Our two litter commissioners have already bugged out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| Sorry, Commissioner, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| You had your back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| So this is a, is there any discussion tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| I know like the last month's meeting we sent this forward kind of quickly with no recommendation to get the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| As I mentioned at that particular meeting, my perception had always been with the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| I guess having worked in kind of a career ago in sort of an hourly position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| I remember we had a shop steward from the union that whenever you're going to get a reprimand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| or potentially get terminated, often, you know, you sort of had the union step in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| and in a way that's sort of, we don't have, not so much a union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| but I'd always sort of seen that Merit Council in that type of a role here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And frankly, I really, that's an organization that's under commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| and I never really realized on the front end how deeply involved they were in a lot of our hiring decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| really until this came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| So I do see Sheriff Spangler in the back as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| Sheriff, did you want to speak to this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| I think you're out of, you weren't at last week's meeting, or excuse me, last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2694)|
| 0:45:03| Do you need a motion on the floor, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Yeah, there is no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| I've just brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Could I get a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Motion is sent without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| So we have a motion that's forward and no rep from Commissioner Anders, and second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Tom Spangler, 400 Main Avenue, Knox County Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Just real quick, we don't have any issues with what's in front of the board right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| I think what I'm asking for is that this commission put together a committee of representatives from this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2725)|
| 0:45:33| along with our agency and representatives of the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| because I think what's going to happen to keep from coming and piecemealing this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| I think what we need to do is be able to sit down and go over some other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| some other changes as a collective body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| and make sure that we get some things changed in agreement with us and them and them with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| And hopefully that will keep us from having to come back later at a different date and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| hey, there's another change we'd like to see or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| So that's the reason I'm here, just to ask for this body to put that committee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| This will be a research question for Mr. Boock for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Wouldn't that, I mean the commission, I think it's a great idea to kind of have a review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| kind of a charter review of the Merit Council, but wouldn't that come from, all that come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| I mean commission really, it's not a function of commission to, it's us to pass the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| I guess that would have to come out of the Merit Council to do that, a review, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| You know, a long-term review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| I guess it would be a research question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| Who has oversight of the Merit Council to make those suggestions to the Merit Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Ultimately this body has the authority to amend the merit system thing under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2806)|
| 0:46:55| Having a committee, I think what the sheriff is suggesting is if they're trying to get some agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| on amending that if it needs to be amended, and to me a committee that is made up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| that would not have just these people, or people from this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| but also from the sheriff and the Merit Council, it's up to you basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| Is it a good idea? I don't know. That's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| But you all make the final decision on any amendment to the Merit Council ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| and how it's done so long as it's in line with the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| That doesn't really answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Well, to me it does. I knew we had final change in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| but I mean the body on this commission has very little knowledge of the workings of the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| and I think that we have to be careful not to politicize it because that's the purpose of the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| You're very true. That's a very true statement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| So how this board decides to do it, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| But this commission, it's kind of a weird animal, the merit system is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| I know you dealt with it on the city side and have a good understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| but how commission gets an understanding of it is up to the commission, how they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| Mr. Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| Yes, sir, go ahead. Just name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Jim Jennings, Tazeville Pike, chair of the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| And the Merit Council was established in 1981-71 by state law, which is sunshine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2904)|
| 0:48:34| and then this commission chooses the people that sit on the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2914)|
| 0:48:43| And what this thing that we're asking you to do is just simply a cost savings that Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2923)|
| 0:48:53| Ms. Taylor, she would be here tonight and could explain this a lot more than I can, but she's quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| But this is just about saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| The way they've been doing the psychological testing, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| if we don't do any harm but we do all the testing, the Merit Council does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| And if HR needs two hirees and they send ten up there, the only thing that costs money in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2958)|
| 0:49:30| physicals are done in-house, but Helen Ross McNabb does the psychologicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| So if you send ten, the way the rules are is that if you send ten up there, she hires two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2975)|
| 0:49:44| then they only do the psychological test for the two hired and the eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| and it's probably a couple hundred bucks over a period of a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| of the people that are never going to go to work for the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| That money's gone, and we tabulated it up this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| It's about $100,000 in savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| It has nothing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| The council rules, and it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| I have to talk to my attorney a lot because everything's illegal, and it's not an easy position to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| It's a non-paying, but it is to keep the politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| I'm sure that thing was designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| I've lived in this community a long time, and it's protection for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3028)|
| 0:50:37| If they bring something over there and they want to change a job description, generally we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| but they have to explain why, or if they're going to eliminate jobs, it can't be for political reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| I appreciate Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| He spent about an hour with me, and I gave him that manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| and I hope that he'll share the information with the council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| So it's one of the toughest committees I've been on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| I've got sucker tattooed on my head, so I've been in a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| But all this is about is when Ms. Taylor took that to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3076)|
| 0:51:24| he said you can keep doing what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| but I think I heard the legal word of Mr. Andrews to codify the language with what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| and that's simply all this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| Read through the manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| We'll meet with anyone, but if you have a new administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| and there have been plenty of sheriffs go through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| and they've got new HR, new HR people, and they're not used to dealing with government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3114)|
| 0:52:01| And, you know, government moves slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| I couldn't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| I'm a decision maker, and this is all this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| It's not any more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| I appreciate Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| I've always been supportive of the KPD and the Nosh County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| So I would appreciate if you could support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| If any time they want to have a sit down, you know, you need to go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3144)|
| 0:52:33| The rules are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| It's pretty fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| But if you'll read through, you'll see that this thing is designed to protect the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| of the Nosh County Sheriff's Office, and it sets standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| There's so much time in a rank before you get a promotion, and that gets the politics out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| So they're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| They've got new people in HR, and I'm sure Ms. Taylor will work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| And sometimes, you know, I want to do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| and my accountant will tell me, no, you can't do that because it has rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| And it's just adjusting to the new deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| And next week, I would appreciate your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| All I need to do is going to save the county $100,000, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| And I know sometimes that's not a lot of money, but where I come from, it's a pretty nice little deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| So if the sheriff needs to sit down and his people need to sit down with Ms. Taylor and the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3210)|
| 0:53:38| and you all want to assign somebody to monitor that, it's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| It's not an easy deal, and I've got two more years in my second term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| and I'll be glad because a lot of times when we hear these grievances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| we're messing with somebody's livelihood, and that's not a decision that I take lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| And so we want to make sure that these dismissals are justified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| and they run through the chain of command before it ever gets to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| It's a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| All right, Mr. Jenkins, I think Commissioner Daley's got his light on and Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| So I'm going to go ahead and recognize Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| He might have a question or a statement, and then Commissioner Jay's light on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| You know, I met with Jim Wright and Paula, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| and I actually believe that I'm going to say 95 percent of all of our problems is communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| and I agree with the sheriff, and I told last month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| we need either one, two, or three people from this commission as a non-voting member to attend the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3282)|
| 0:54:51| Now, that will probably need to be brought to the Rules Committee to set up a committee, right, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| You might need to check with the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| I don't even know if that's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| What this commission does is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| I mean, if this commission wants to appoint a committee to meet with them, that's the province of this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3305)|
| 0:55:14| and it's certainly, I can't say it's not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| I don't know why you would say it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| Well, you know, a lot of times we'll sit here, and there will be something come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| and I'm just going to throw this out, the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| And I know Commissioner Busler goes to the railroad meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| so all we have to do is look at Commissioner Busler, and he'll tell us what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| But we don't have that person right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| I don't care if it's one, two, or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| but I think that we need to look at it in our next commission to set up a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Mr. Buch, I would like some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| It doesn't need to be this minute because it's going to be passed forward to next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| but I would like some, I think everybody on this body may like to understand where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| how was the American Council formed, or is it a state statute as was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| or is it totally created by our commission and who governs it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| and maybe some of the documentation that Mr. Jennings referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| just so we have an understanding of sort of how we got to today from just a legal form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| and who has oversight, and that way it might help shape the conversation of where do we go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| If you could provide that to us offline, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| You ask a lot of intertwining legal questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| The merit system was established by the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| and gives the power to the local bodies for the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| and the police department is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| That's up to the local municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| But it gives power to the legislative body to create this merit system under the terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| requirements, and limitations, which are very few under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| The merit system then meets and creates its own rules subject to the state law with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3420)|
| 0:57:10| The overriding thing, as Mr. Jennings says, is the protection of officers from political input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| with regard to their firings and their advancements and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| Ultimately, does the commission have the oversight of the merit council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| You have the oversight insofar as like what was brought up with the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| You have the oversight to create or dissolve the health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| but you don't have any oversight in what the health board does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| So it's a little bit like the relationship with the school board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| We're being asked to approve an ordinance here that changes the rules or changes the way that they operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3466)|
| 0:57:53| but yet we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| Their actual operation and what they do and the decisions they make with regard to an officer or a grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| you have no control over that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| But the rules itself, we're being asked to codify a rule change, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| So if this commission wanted to change rules 1 through 10, I'm just going to make this up for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| If this commission said, we want to change rules 1 through 10, could this commission do that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| That's a hypothetical that I'd need to look at to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| It's hard to make a hypothetical leap like that on just something saying like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| I'm just trying to understand what our role is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| Well, your role is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| I think what Mr. Jennings has set out and the mayor has agreed to is going to save the taxpayers a tremendous amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| Yeah, but I'm not talking about this particular rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| I'm just trying to figure out what our role is as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3523)|
| 0:58:51| I'm just trying to understand what we can and can't do or what we have the ability or don't have the ability to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| It sounds to me like our chair Spangler essentially wants to review several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| It could be a number of different policies or changes in the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| And as expressed by Commissioner Daley, maybe there's an opportunity to form a committee that sits and analyzes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3547)|
| 0:59:15| and understands what they do in more detail and make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| But if that were to come out of that as a recommendation, does this body say we want to pass a resolution changing X, Y, and Z?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| Or can that only be changed by the Merit Council's Board of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| I think that would have to be answered on a per-item basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| I can't give you a blanket on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| But here again, I think an understanding and a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| I've always believed if two parties get together, they can work things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| And an understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| So it depends on what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| So if this commission wanted to say we want ten people on the Board of the Merit Council and not just three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| could that be done by this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| Or is that a specific resolution that has to be done in a different way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| I'm just trying to understand the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| I don't have the statute in front of me, so I can't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| So maybe that's something we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Commissioner Smith, you were waving at me, but I know that Commissioner Biggs' light was on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| All I'm going to say is maybe it would just be easier if whenever we reorganize next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| we put a non-voting member of commission on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| That's something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| The code says it's three members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| You can appoint an alternate member, but you'd have to change the code to put a commissioner on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| Even if it's non-voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| Your alternate could be your, you could put an alternate on there as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| but it's section 42-53, Merit Council, comprised of three members elected by commission to administer the terms of the division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3639)|
| 1:00:49| Alternate member of county commission has the authority to appoint an alternate member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| The commission shall appoint such member the next regularly scheduled meeting of the commission upon taking nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| And the alternate actually votes if another member is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| So you'd have to change the law to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| The reason being, I'm just trying to wrap my mind about what we're intervening in or whatever on the board that we set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| I can get something to you, if you like, with more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| I do not have the state statute in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| I'm going to go to Commissioner Smith, then I'll make a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| I was going to kind of follow up with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| It seems that the Sheriff's Department has some ideals of the things that they would like to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| Perhaps it would be good if he supplied that to the Law Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| and the Law Department could tell us if it's something that we could change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| or if it's something that has to come from the Merit Board before we start forming too many committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=3701)|

| 1:07:06| I know Commissioner Daley had a question about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| And Super Bob, I think the question as I posed it in the forum was, hopefully, it was pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| So, I know Commissioner Daley, I'll look to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| He had a question on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| And back to you, Super Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Yeah, it just piqued my interest that I know West, when we went there last year for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| event, it amazed me how huge West High School has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| So, it piqued my interest to see that, you know, we're having to lose space to add a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| softball field for the girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Just see what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| And I think you said it was, what, $25 an hour for rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| They have a football field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| And then there was also another field that was used for practice, different athletics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| So, there's a softball field going into there, which sort of renders that space not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| available, not, well, useless, I guess, in terms of practicing for softball and lacrosse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| So, renting this facility would provide practice areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| And this is not really unique because when the football field was redone a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| years ago, I think there was also use of these facilities that, of course, really close by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Is this going to be long-term or just for until July of next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| As far as I know, it's probably a long-term situation just because of the limited space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| there at West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| Like I say, it amazes me, you know, back in 1976, 77, it wasn't that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4117)|
| 1:08:45| So, it's a lot bigger today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| It's grown quite a bit, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4129)|

| 1:11:46| I guess if Russ or Jim come on down, just to start date, what our finish date was, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4306)|
| 1:11:53| if you're not being out to the high school, our kids or teenagers are crossing the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| five, six, seven times a day, which is very, very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| It would not put anything in a terrorist's mind, but, man, it would be easy to run over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| a bunch of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| And I am so tickled that we got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| Christy's been working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| I guess we've been working on this one, Doug, three, four years now, first time we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| And we talked about a tunnel, but thank God we're not putting in a tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| We're doing a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| So, if you would, just give us an update so I will know when I get a call or Christy gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Doug Dillingham, Director of Facilities and Construction, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| We have been through the bidding process and also through some value engineering on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| It's on commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| The school board's already approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| So, as soon as we get the approvals and get all the signatures on the contract, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| establish a pre-construction meeting with Tim Berry and his people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4377)|
| 1:13:04| We'll let you know about it as well if you'd like to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| That's where we kind of establish scheduling and what the contractor's going to need, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| As a part of the bid, they have given us a contract term of 240 consecutive calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| So, to give you an idea, if we gave them a notice to proceed on September the 1st, 240| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| calendar days would be basically the end of April of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| Of course, there are weather delay days that are involved in that, too, if we hit inclement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| weather as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| As far as any traffic flow and traffic disruption, we think that that's going to be minimal because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| the design of the bridge is a prefabricated system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| So, we think that it would just be blocking off Tipton Station Road as they set the beams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| So, you know, it may be off and on for a couple of weeks, but we're hoping that it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| very minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| That's one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| I know when Mr. Snowden and our roads department did Gap Creek Bridge, it was prefab, cut to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| time in two-thirds, I guess, or half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| So, that's great to know it's going to be prefabbed and be set in place on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| Well, I'll tell you, I've done a lot of buildings in my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| This will be my first bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| I do have Mr. Snowden on speed dials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| Well, if anything goes wrong, we know who to blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| And I just, from the kids at South Dole and the teachers and everything, thank you very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| We really, really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| Still a couple other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| From the number that I've seen, we've got Beeler, Biggs, then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| Go ahead, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Yeah, I just want to say I fully support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| I've walked across Tipton Station Road many a time for football games at South Dole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4508)|
| 1:15:15| But I will say, I do hope that in the near future, we will begin serious discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| with not only Knox County, but the state of Tennessee about a similar project across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| Tazewell Pike for the Gibbs School Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| Because, of course, as a school system, folks are well aware, Gibbs Middle and elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| school are directly across State Highway 131 from Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| And connectivity is improving in the Gibbs community, and it's probably going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| to as some development occurs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| But as it does, the situation with Tazewell Pike becomes more and more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| We had a pedestrian hit by a car at a football game last fall, and honestly, could have resulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4552)|
| 1:16:00| in a fatality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| And a pedestrian bridge, of course, will be a large-scale project, but it's probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| only thing TDOT's going to approve across that state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| So I just wanted to put that out there, and hopefully with some cooperation from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| that's a project we can begin to seriously discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| Mr. Dillingham, first I want to say thanks, because I know this project started out right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| at $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| To see it down at $1.45 million is amazing to me, the sound of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| But if they don't complete in 240 calendar days, do we get any reduction in the price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| Well, we, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| We do have liquidated damages included in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| I don't recall if it's $500 or $1,000 a day that they have to pay us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| Now, again, you know, there are contingencies within the contract as far as weather delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4612)|
| 1:16:59| days and all that that can extend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| And when you've got a project that's totally on the exterior, then you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| some days that you'll probably be adding to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| So, as far as the contract itself, I mean, the contractor was absolutely wonderful dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4632)|
| 1:17:20| with us and trying to help us save money and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| And the engineer, as far as trying to figure out how to reduce to get the price down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| Also, if you don't mind, whenever you send that to Commissioner Daly, I'd like to sunshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| it and come as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| Go ahead and back to Commissioner Smith and then Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| From a risk management and safety standpoint, the fact that you have kids going across that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| street every day from campus to campus as part of their normal daily academic activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| this is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Does the design of the bridge allow for any future expansion of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4681)|
| 1:18:11| The answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| I believe that the spans across the road itself are at least 60 feet and maybe 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4695)|
| 1:18:26| So, yeah, that would allow for some expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| And the abutments for the bridge on either side would allow for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| I'd like to congratulate Commissioner Daly for moving forward and sticking with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| And also, I'm just glad that you didn't have to go forward with the first toll bridge in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| So, I appreciate you getting that handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| It's not out of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| On page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Do we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| Do we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| We've got to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| We've got to vote on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4748)|

| 1:19:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| I've been distracted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Item number 28, approving a memorandum of understanding between the Knox County Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| of Education and Knox County Education Association is recommended by the conferencing team for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| a period of three years, Resolution 215.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| Could I have a motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| And your motion was for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| And a second from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| And I can't remember who pulled this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Was it you, Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| I just need to ask a few questions regarding our MOU, which would be helpful, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4787)|
| 1:19:54| just for the general public regarding, I'm on page eight, which happens to be the working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4794)|
| 1:20:02| conditions of our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| And if the language in this document have to be updated regarding the working conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4804)|
| 1:20:15| for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| And I know this pandemic is a huge issue for our teachers and our parents and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4816)|
| 1:20:25| And I just need to know if any of this language, because it's the same language we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| in terms of our planning time and our working hours for our teachers and the working conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4831)|
| 1:20:38| needed to be reflected in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4838)|
| 1:20:46| So this is the, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Ms. Coates, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| If you could, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| And state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Bonnie Coates, President of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| I was coming to stand with Bob and Bob decided to sit down because this is our collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| with the school board and the educators of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| So you brought up a really good question after this is passed this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| We know that we try to schedule meetings, that those questions will be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| COVID is new, but in regards to our working conditions, we try to do what's best for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| the educators in Knox County and making sure that we are working together on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4884)|
| 1:21:32| And there is no language about COVID in the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| So I just needed to figure out how that language would alter the MOU if it is not embedded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4895)|
| 1:21:43| in this document that is under the collaborative conferencing agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| Mr. Chair, members of the commission, there's not specific language related to COVID in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| However, what we have worked with the teacher association on are the safety guidelines that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| we've talked about, putting hand sanitizer, mounting those in each classroom, also having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| disinfectant in the classrooms to spray on common areas or high touched areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4928)|
| 1:22:16| And towels, paper towels, also providing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| We're doing social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| The board just passed a policy on masks, face masks, social distancing where we can in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4942)|
| 1:22:30| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| So we've communicated that, I think, very many times, I think, with our teachers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| through our principals and the staff and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| So there's not language specific to COVID in the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| It's a three-year agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| A lot of the language in this agreement is similar to language that was in the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| three-year agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| But we've worked over the past year with KCEA, our professional collaborative conferencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| teams, working together to arrive at this MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| And then COVID has been more or less separate, I guess, from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| But certainly taking into consideration all the safety guidelines, the CDC's, all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| So we're adhering to those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| In addition, the state is also sending safety kits that will have face shields, masks, gloves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| wipes, I believe, to all the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| And that is to be replenished over the course of the year when the situation gets worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| So we're adhering to those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| In addition, the state is also sending safety kits that will have face shields, masks, gloves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| over the course of the year when the supplies are exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| We're also doing temperature checks for students and staff and requiring masks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| visitors on campus and appointments for visitors on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| So we're trying to take all those safety precautions that have been recommended by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| the CDC to make our schools as safe as we possibly can for students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| I just wanted to make sure I had an answer on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| So we didn't need to have the language updated or changed to reflect the policies or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| grievances in this MOU because it hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| So thank you, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| But we work, so Mr. Thomas didn't say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| His office, Mr. Thomas and the administration has been very helpful in making sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5058)|
| 1:24:26| one, we have an agreement on the table right now that really doesn't expire until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| So he, at any point, I could call his office and we try to make sure that we get those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| clear in regards to cases that are happening at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| So it may not be written, but we have an underlying agreement that he's going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| whatever it takes to make sure that his staff is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| So I'm very confident that we can continue to move forward and have those meaningful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| conversations without writing it because, again, this will be a three-year contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| and working conditions, that's something that we had already alluded to before we had this passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| that we would come to the table and talk about anything so that most of you know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5106)|
| 1:25:13| that there's 18 of us that will sit down together in the midst of COVID to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| So it may not be written in this contract, but because working conditions is one of those criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| we will have that discussion by, if we decide we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| Because we have also set a time every month that we will meet together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| We haven't done that because it hasn't been passed through this board yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| But as soon as that, we will set up our monthly meetings that we did not miss for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5145)|

| 1:25:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| Follow-up question, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| When you're talking about health, I'm going to give a plug for Leaders for Readers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| Love that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| How is that going to affect our volunteer parents, our community leaders that come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| I hope that program, hopefully we can do that program this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| I had three little buddies last year that, you know, I can see a difference in them from the beginning to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5168)|
| 1:26:16| There's a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| I don't know if you've come up with a policy yet, John, or if you don't, say that we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| So we've been working with the Knoxville Education Foundation, formerly Great Schools Partnership, that has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5187)|
| 1:26:35| And they actually are looking for virtual options for the volunteers still to be able to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| We're working through right now some of the security issues around that and what the best platform to do that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| So we are working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| I know Chris Lesos, the new leader of that organization, has been very active in trying to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| So we're working toward it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| I haven't worked through all the details yet, but we're working for the right platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5221)|

| 1:27:07| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| This is Resolution 217 that was added, and it's a contract for virtual schooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5232)|
| 1:27:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Could I get a motion on that particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| This is the one I emailed you all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| I know you just got it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| You may want to send it forward with no recommendation if you want to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| But it is something I know we do need to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Motion to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| Motion to send forward no recommendation from Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Is there any discussion, or would you all like to give us an overview on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| Ron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| It may take all of us, but I'll get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Commissioner, thank you for giving us the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| And let me say thank you, too, for adding consideration to add the item and to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| And, again, what we, as you probably have heard and know, we've had over 18,000 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| to sign up for virtual programming, which, again, was a little bit of a surprise, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| But, certainly, we're glad to try to accommodate everyone who signed up for virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| And what we've tried to do is to make sure that we've utilized our staff as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| in terms of staffing the virtual program, in other words, Knox County teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| And we've done a pretty good job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| When we started out, the Florida Virtual will be used primarily at high school level, grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| 9 through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| When we started out, this contract looked like it was about $1.9 million to $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5320)|
| 1:28:47| And since that point in time, we've had a lot of our teachers who are giving up their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| planned period to teach in the program, which has allowed us to decrease the number of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| we would need from Florida Virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| So, when we started out, I think there was about 2,094 classes that would have needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| to be staffed by Florida Virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| Now, as of last week, that was down to 311 classes, which is about $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| So, what we're asking in this contract, the range to be $300,000 to a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| So, down quite a bit from where we first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| And it's probably down more today than it was last week, because this was as of last Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| So, again, this will give us the latitude to make sure that we meet all the scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| requests of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| And we're still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| We've got the rest of this week to work to try to identify teachers that would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| decrease the number of teachers that we would need from Florida Virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| And that's come up a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| There's been an issue, I think, back in the past, 2018, with Florida Virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| There were some leadership issues with the company at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| There's new leadership now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| I know they redefined their strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| The couple of issues, one was over a data breach, I believe, which they've indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| to us has been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| And, again, the new leadership, I think, has corrected the other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| This is a program approved by the Tennessee State Board of Education, Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| They have worked with several other school systems in the state of Tennessee and worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| successfully with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| So I wanted to be transparent in the process and let you know the issues that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5426)|
| 1:30:35| and then what we've tried to do to mitigate those issues and to continue to utilize our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| teachers as much as possible for the Virtual program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| So it's kind of a brief overview of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| The final contract wasn't available for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| The board approved the contract pending law department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| So things happened after last Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| We do have a final contract now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| What you've got is the contract that I think the law department has approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| What we're going to do with the board, because the law department suggested we go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| the Board of Education and let the board approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| So we'll have a virtual meeting, virtual board meeting, before the end of this week for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| board to approve this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| The vote last week was eight to one approval for the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| So I would anticipate at this point, since there have been no real major changes in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| of the terms of the contract, that we, again, would get the majority support of the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| of Education and we'll have that virtual meeting sometime before the end of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| So I've got Ron here to answer questions and John if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| So I don't know if you want more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| If you've got more questions, we'll be glad to try to entertain those and answer them for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Yes, my question is about the cost and how are we paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| Where does our money come from, Ron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| How much does it, where, how are we paying for Florida Virtual Academy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| In our general purpose budget, operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| And, again, right now what we, where we were last week was about $300,000 for the first semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5533)|
| 1:32:21| We will, towards the end of the semester, we'll give students an opportunity if they want to opt out of virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| to come back to the in-person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| And also if you're in-person and you want to go to virtual, we'll, you know, we'll extend that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| So second semester would be, we just have to wait and see for a few months what second semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| But we don't anticipate any more than $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| Second semester is in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| Are we, January, as in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| Yes, ma'am, January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| So then we'll reevaluate whether or not we still need the $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| In December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| And this contract is one year, and to do more than that would take approval by the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| and also County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| So, again, just appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| I know you don't like to get things at late notice, but just appreciate you so much for entertaining this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| so that we can provide the classes for our students that we promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| Thank you, Super Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| About two years ago, Mr. Thomas, you and I talked about TNVA, you know, where they were getting ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5594)|
| 1:33:22| in here in Tennessee, and they're still going and they're still supplying other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| Why didn't we choose our own product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| Because it's a K-12 based education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| The TNVA system is headquartered up here in Campbell County, which takes care of the whole state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| I wonder why we didn't look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| Maybe John has more information about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| I know Florida Virtual, when we looked at some school districts that were using that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| using Florida Virtual and the product and so forth, we were very satisfied with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| And from the standpoint, I know it's accredited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| I'm not saying the other is not accredited either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| It was accredited through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| But the reason why I was asking that, it's a national thing that the virtual schools with that K-12 base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5645)|
| 1:34:12| and the person that set it up for the whole nation was in Campbell County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| even the Florida one that was set up where they had national meetings on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| And that person was in Campbell County, which was real close to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| which we could have better communication with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| I just wonder why we just didn't look at that since it was approved by the Tennessee Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| I think just because of the timing issue, I guess, that we were already aware of Florida Virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| and the fact that a couple other counties were using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| We thought we could piggyback off that contract initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| That's how this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| We ended up having to do an emergency procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| But, again, we started out thinking we could piggyback off of the Metro Nashville contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| but that didn't work exactly like we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| And the only reason why I was mentioning this, they started in Campbell County, that group up there with TNVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| they started back about six months ago to get ready for school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| But they opened earlier, and they have their protocol set up for the COVID-19 and all like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| And they had one instance come up where they didn't have to shut the whole school down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| It was mitigated within like seven people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| And, you know, they'd been working on it to get everything set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| but it just seemed kind of odd that we would go way out of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| when we had the thing that set up Florida Virtual Schools in Campbell County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| And we'll be glad to look at that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| And let me just say, too, that using an outside service for this is not what we wanted to do, not ideal at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5740)|
| 1:35:48| And, again, just because of the numbers of students that actually wanted to take advantage of the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| forced us into looking at an alternative in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| And by the time school starts next week, it may even be less than what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| But we'll be glad to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Okay. I was just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| I thought, you know, since it was Tennessee started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| and they've made the whole nation through that one thing through Campbell County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| we just went someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| It was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| Also got Commissioner Schoonmaker and then Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| This question will be for Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| So the max, according to the documents you submitted to us, for the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| would be a maximum of $1 million that we could spend with this contractor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| Ron, the quotes that you submitted to us, and they're not invoices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| I was trying to, it says the sales price of $475, quantity 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| Does that mean 48 hours of supervision at $475, or is that 48 students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5815)|
| 1:37:02| What does this mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Because it says anatomy and physiology, semester one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| Do you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| I know it's $950 per student, but I'm going to let Dr. Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| So it's set up the way Florida Virtual does those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| is they do them for half credits for $450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| So a full credit for a student would be both of those for $900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| And they're not time-bound, so they're asynchronous classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| meaning that the students will have access to those 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| to be able to access those to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| So I don't know if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| So it's in .5 increments instead of a full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| but a student would have to have both of those to make the full credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| And I think the way they built the quote was off of the number of sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| that we needed from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| I don't have it in front of me right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| but the number of sections that they had to get to that total number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| So the actual cheap, the least expensive class to take would be Art History| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| at $400 instead of $475.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| Yeah, I think they're roughly $450 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| So, yeah, there may be a little bit of variance in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| If they mischarged Art History, you'd be Baroque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| This is your last work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| Commissioner Smith, your light was on earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| and did you have another follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| I'm just checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| John was going to address the question that Commissioner Bussler had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| and I was going to give him that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| Does the school in Campbell County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| does all funding follow that student if they enroll in that school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| So my understanding, and just a little more history on Florida Virtual Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| so Florida Virtual School began in 1997| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| and actually is probably one of the largest in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| I was talking about the school in Campbell County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Oh, in Campbell County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| I was going to get to why we lean toward Florida Virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| as opposed to Tennessee's Virtual School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| Tennessee has struggled to get off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| Florida offers 190 courses, including AP and honors courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| that currently that full catalog of courses is not available from the Tennessee one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| So I think just an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| like the reason our contract was held up is the state of Massachusetts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| was waiting on a contract with Florida Virtual School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| So I think pretty highly respected when it comes to the development for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| and offer more courses for what we needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| because a lot of the courses we were struggling to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| were around AP courses and honors that were kind of one-off classes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| So how that works is our students would be still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| if we, again, depending on what you purchased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| so like in this case, we purchased, and I think it would be the same from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| if a student unenrolled from Knox County and then enrolled in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| then they would be part of that school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| And I would assume, I'm not positive, but I'm assuming the dollars would follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| But if they stayed with us and what we're doing with Florida Virtual and that kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| they're still our students, but we're buying just the curriculum and the teacher for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| So they're, again, out of state, so there wouldn't be any transfer money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| But if we did lose a student too from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| and went into the Tennessee Virtual School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| I believe that would be a change of district at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Okay, that motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6055)|

| 1:40:57| All right, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| On page 6, item number 34,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| approving a local agency project agreement with the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| for the Jarahella Extension Project from Coward Mill Road to Horseshoe Bend Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6069)|
| 1:41:17| with an estimated project cost of $6,200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| and Knox County responsible for an estimated $4,200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| for the project cost Resolution 404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Okay, we have a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Mr. Anders, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| All right, second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Hey, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| I pulled this one just for a quick update on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| It's one of our largest infrastructure projects going on in the county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| And I recall, I think my first year on commission, we had a whole lot of stuff going on over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| And now we've seen other things related to, you know, school area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| We've got a lot going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| And some of the public may not be following this quite as closely as this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| So if you could give us, number A, a big picture, kind of what's going on in that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| It's related to construction as well as infrastructure on Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| And also just remind us, because when someone sees this caption you see, $6,200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| remind everybody that this is also a shared cost between us and TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| So if you could kind of briefly, when you update us, remember you're updating the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| I'd be glad to, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| Yeah, Phase 1 of Chirahala is about 1,300 feet long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| It runs from the terminus at the cul-de-sac now to Coward Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| which will serve additional traffic capacity for the new school on Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| As you know, we also have the project to widen Coward Mill Road from that location back to Chuck Jones Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6157)|
| 1:42:46| The savings that we are paying for that project come from exactly this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| This is what's called a local interstate connector project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| The state allows for that project, if it's adjacent to a state highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| for the state to provide 50% of the funds for that, up to $4,000,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| So that's why you see only $2,000,000 of the 6.2 is being halved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| One of the other things we're also working with the TPO on is to hopefully secure some federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| and state money to additionally fund the remaining 4.2 of the county's percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6196)|
| 1:43:23| because of the long-range transportation plan currently has Pellissippi Parkway as to be converted to a three-lane facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6203)|
| 1:43:32| much like what TDOT is doing with Alcoa Highway now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| So obviously, this project, Phase 2, what is this particular contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| extends Chirahala from existing Coward Mill to Faith Promise and will eliminate their at-grade access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| So that is furthering TDOT's plan for that roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| So that's why we're asking them for those funds as well as the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| And we should start Phase 1 construction later this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| and hopefully the subsequent Phase 2 within the next two to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| All right. Thank you, Jim. Any follow-up questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| Okay. All in favor of this motion, which is properly before us, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| Opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6257)|

| 1:44:19| Okay. The ayes have it. Thank you. Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| Item number 36 is approving a contract with Wiley Construction LLC for concrete work and repair services as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6261)|
| 1:44:32| Resolution 406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| Can I get a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| Okay. We have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders, and I didn't hear who was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| All right. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| Okay. Who pulled that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| I'm not sure if there's some clarifying questions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| Have we got the new contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| Okay. All right. Did you get a hard copy of that contract, everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| No, they changed it. It was really very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| Okay. So is this good? I'll look to Jim. How are we on this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6308)|
| 1:45:14| Yeah. Sorry for the slight delay on this, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| We were actually – some of the prices that Wiley submitted were above what our anticipations were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| so we've met with them and negotiated some lower prices, and we're comfortable with these prices and contract moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6323)|
| 1:45:30| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| All right. That motion is properly before us. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| Okay. The ayes have it. Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| On page 7, item number 38 is a resolution authorizing the acceptance of federal funds in the amount up to $710,097| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6342)|
| 1:45:55| in HUD CARES Act CDBG-CV supplemental funding and two, approving a substantial amount –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6355)|
| 1:46:05| a substantial amendment to Knox County's previously-approved 2020 Annual Action Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| to include programs such as rent, mortgage, and utilities assistance for low- and moderate-income households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6371)|
| 1:46:19| and small business relief, utilizing the above-mentioned funds to assist those directly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6379)|
| 1:46:28| This is Resolution 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| A motion for approval from Commissioner Anders with a second from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| Go ahead, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| I'm sure this is one we pulled. There's a lot of interest in this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| And I might remind this body, I believe you and your team gave a presentation to us about two or maybe three months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| on some of the stuff that was in the pipeline as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| But if you could go ahead and provide an update and insight on what's going on with all of these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| and how it's going to work, that would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| Certainly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Dwight Vandeveldt, 400 Main Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| As the Chair mentioned, we have been anticipating these funds for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| The funds were authorized a good while back in the early stages of the CARES Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| but there was no guidance from HUD as to their allowable expendability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| So we have been waiting for that guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| And believe it or not, it arrived early last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| It really didn't contain any surprises, but it does give us clear direction as to where to proceed with the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6445)|
| 1:47:30| So we have put a solicitation out to our nonprofit partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| It is our intent to put these funds into short-term rental, mortgage, and utility assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6457)|
| 1:47:46| Data that we get from United Way, who's been spearheading a lot of the social service work in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| and call volume from 211 suggests that folks' ability, especially those of moderate-income families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6471)|
| 1:47:58| and we are required to use these funds in the service of low- to moderate-income families, are struggling to pay their rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| For those that had federally underwritten mortgages, as you know, those are abated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| but that doesn't actually make the liability go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| It simply defers the payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| And so even for those folks who have been able to defer their mortgage or their rental payments, that liability is coming due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6492)|
| 1:48:22| So we are looking for partners who will help us take these funds and press them out to low- to moderate-income families that have been impacted by the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6502)|
| 1:48:31| The other thing that we hear regularly through the social service meetings is that KUB, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6511)|
| 1:48:38| has the highest number on record of families that are $1,000 or more in arrears on their utility bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| and that is an area that we want to provide some relief as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| So we're glad the guidance finally got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| We're glad to be able to put the funds on the street, and we hope that they'll do some good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6529)|
| 1:48:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| Any follow-up questions from my fellow commissioners on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| Are we having to follow the income guidelines under established by HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| and what is our process under 211 for people in the community to be able to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6547)|
| 1:49:14| to have access to money to help with KUB as well as really probably rental assistance and their mortgages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6554)|
| 1:49:22| What process, call 211, what is our process to allow that money really to be given to the people that are really going to most need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6562)|
| 1:49:33| A good question, Commissioner, and thanks for asking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| Obviously what we are going to start the process tomorrow of going through the applications that we receive from agencies that want to administer the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6576)|
| 1:49:45| Our criteria included the ability to identify and validate low to moderate income status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6585)|
| 1:49:53| so we'll be looking at social service partners that are experienced in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| The other thing that we put an emphasis on when we put this up on our website is what we are looking for partners that will do this with maximum efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6599)|
| 1:50:07| because frankly some agencies will have higher overhead than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| I will tell you our department is waiving the M&A fees that we are normally allowed to charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| We want to put the money on the street, and we are looking for the most efficient response we can get from our social service partners as to how they can get that money on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6617)|
| 1:50:27| The other thing that might be of interest to this body is just as a part of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| the funds actually will distribute to landlords or mortgage holders to hold those loans or notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6632)|
| 1:50:39| and to the utility where the constituent is in arrears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| My other question, which is where I was going with that, which is excellent information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| is will we track where the money is distributed, in what community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6649)|
| 1:50:57| and what really the statistics behind the service level so that we know where the hardest hit areas are and the demographics of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6657)|
| 1:51:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| That data will be captured by the partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| It's all part of the HUD reporting that we'll have to do in any case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| These are community development block grant monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| They're subject to the same framework and expectations as any other community development block grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| The added caveat that the family has to have been impacted by COVID-19, but we will have all that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| Would you send that out to us, or is this short or long-term data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| It'll publish in our comprehensive annual performance evaluation and review, our paper that publishes at the end of our program year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| Thank you. Any follow-up questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| Okay. This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Okay. Madam Clerk, next item, which is 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| This is a resolution approving three six-month memorandum of understanding with the Carnes Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6714)|
| 1:52:02| Seymour Fire Department, and Knox County Rescue for the provision of fire rescue emergency services within their designated response areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6722)|
| 1:52:11| This is resolution 502.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| We have a motion from Commissioner Anders. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Dwight, David, is your, Mr. Law Director, is your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| I'm just, okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| All right. It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| Mr. Vanderbate, if you could provide kind of an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| I know you sent us a memo in advance of this meeting to say here are some things that have been going on related to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| but I think it's also important to sort of follow that up with much of those same points, not just for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| but when you're updating us, you're updating the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| Certainly. I'm glad to do it, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| Thinking about the discussion earlier of things that have been impacted by the pandemic, this is most definitely one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6769)|
| 1:52:55| The mayor had put together a small ad hoc committee to provide to him funding recommendations for FY21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| He actually populated the committee in March and just asked the committee to come back to him with some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| so that when he presented his budget to commission, if he wanted to tweak public safety funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6789)|
| 1:53:16| he'd have the information that he needed to make an informed recommendation to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| Unfortunately, the pandemic happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| This committee was just never able to come together and meet until after the budget was presented to commission and adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6803)|
| 1:53:30| We need these agencies to continue to do the good work that they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| so what we did is we just took their budget, divided it by half, and put together these MOUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| so that they'd be able to continue to receive funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| Now the committee has started to meet, and we'll have some recommendations that will come to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6823)|
| 1:53:49| He'll incorporate them for the balance of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| We'll make sure these agencies get to continue operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| and then there'll be a full set of recommendations in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| But a good process that was just derailed by unforeseen circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| So that's a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| Commissioner Anders is a member of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| Jenny Holden is as well, so they might also have background or information that I've overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6851)|
| 1:54:18| All right, I'm recognizing two lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| Right now I've got Commissioner Daly's was on first, and then Commissioner Jay's came on second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| I guess this is my second soapbox or my issues is public safety as far as the fire goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6867)|
| 1:54:34| Chief John's here from Seymour, and I see the rescue squad, John, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6874)|
| 1:54:44| This is very, very important, and I had a good discussion with a couple of the guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6884)|
| 1:54:50| and, you know, one of their concerns, and I guess one of my concerns is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6890)|
| 1:54:57| they need to know what they've got funding for a year, you know, not just six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| We'll go through real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| I'll go through Station 2 and Station 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| It costs $243,000 to serve 38 square miles of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6908)|
| 1:55:16| That's not a bad price for a fire service, and really it's not really much of a fire service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| more as medical, more medical calls than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6922)|
| 1:55:29| This commission and Mayor Burchett gave $15,000 for a helipad at Station 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6929)|
| 1:55:35| and it's already saved a lot in a couple of landings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| St. McCarns and us and Seymour got $50,000, $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| In the last couple of years, we've got $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| Seymour's is $375,000 total for the last four years, which has helped tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| Now, if a SAFER grant runs out, they've only got three full-time, three employees there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6954)|
| 1:56:02| If a SAFER grant runs out, that cost of running that station from $243,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| will have to be made up by donations, the boot drive, or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| So I would really—we don't want to get into the fire business, as other counties have told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6972)|
| 1:56:20| ambulance and fire, but we're going to start looking seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| About $243,000 to serve 38 square miles for their citizens is not a bad price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6983)|
| 1:56:34| Rural Metro and the Rescue Squad, I checked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| They do not charge a subscription rate for county emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| but I see where Carnes has billed us this year for $1,000 for the Senior Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| $1,150 for the library, and over the past four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| a subscription rate of $9,454 for county entities like the parks and the library and the Senior Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7015)|
| 1:57:04| and they received $325,000 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| I hope this takes into consideration that we don't—as taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| I don't think we need to be paying a subscription and then turn around and give them $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7032)|
| 1:57:18| That ought to cover that, and I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7038)|
| 1:57:24| It's—I love what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| Their website says that they're a 501c3, but they don't take any taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| They've taken $325,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| I'd like to see it for a whole year where they know that they've got this funding for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| and I just can't see them operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| One of my big concerns is concerned about the termination clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7070)|
| 1:58:00| It says that the termination clause is that they could be terminated within five days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7080)|
| 1:58:08| but they don't tell me what cause is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| Can you tell me what cause is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| Typically in a defined service contract, it would be fair to perform to the standards of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| One of the things to remember, Commissioner, is these are a little bit of a substitute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| an 11th-hour substitute, unfortunately, for defined service contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| that previously were in place for Seymour and for the rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7108)|
| 1:58:35| It is our hope to put Carnes under a contract as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| Of course, Rural Metro obviously operates without a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| Long term, I think that is something that this body is going to have to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| Again, not representing that we're going to get into the fire service business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| but if an agency is going to operate within the county's borders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| and be responsible for the provision of certain services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| then we should have a say in how those services are provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| Let me say also that it's not our intent to disrupt in any way the operation of any of these agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| and we anticipate they will be funded for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| We just needed more time to put together a set of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| This is really about looking at how these agencies have evolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| and how the community has evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| You've mentioned something I think is important to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| For instance, now Carnes is moving to a subscription model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| Rural Metro already has a subscription model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| Rural Metro, I believe, may also have a contracted service with the Forks of the River Industrial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| for which they're compensated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| They did it one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| It's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| No more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| No more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| But all of those things need to be sort of thrown on the table and given a long, hard look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7179)|
| 1:59:44| before proposals come back to commission for the full fiscal year for FY22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7184)|
| 1:59:50| That's where we were hoping to get, but again, the pandemic derailed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| But rest assured, I don't think it's our intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| and it wasn't the mayor's intent to disrupt the operation of any of these agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| They do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| We'll continue to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| There are some big questions that over time are going to need further examination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| certainly that we've had the ability to give them in the month or two we've been able to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| since the pandemic settled down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| Yeah, we had the CTAS report that came out a year or more ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7214)|
| 2:00:20| but we've not heard any more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| Of course, I think their final determination was to have a fire or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7223)|
| 2:00:30| There was no final determination in the CTAS report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| There were recommendations for best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| and as we do as a county with most of our studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| we sat down and sat on our hands because it might cost us a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| So this really is in culmination of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| The mayor and I met along with all the agencies in Dwight in February, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| and this is really just a culmination of that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| that we don't just let that sit by the side of myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| where the mayor neither one wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| There's a lot that goes into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| Everybody is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| I mean, Seymour delivers service through donations and county funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| Carnes does subscription and county funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Rural Metro is obviously a for-profit company with a fire district in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| and the Rescue Squad has lived on volunteerism for a long time and grown into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7276)|
| 2:01:24| I've been their biggest advocate since 2010 when their funding was $75,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| and I've been able to help push that up around to the $425,000 mark that it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7289)|
| 2:01:35| But this is just a look at the county and the services delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| Can we do it better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| And if we can't do it better, do we need to put more money into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| That's really the bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| and it's just hoping that we can get the best out of all of our partner agencies that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| And I think, thank you, Brad, or Commissioner, these groups do fantastic work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7311)|
| 2:01:57| They absolutely do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| And I don't want to go home tonight and cross that river bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| and have to see Seymour or Rural Metro or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| But if I need them, I want them to be there, and I want them to know that we're behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| I want them to know that Carson-Daly is behind them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| and I will try my best to support them in every way that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| So I'm going to vote for this, and I love this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| Is this something that the committee started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| I can't see it from here, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| It's a Knox County monthly performance measure report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| Is that something brand new, or is that how it's been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| We're trying to use the defined service contract model that we use for other agencies to get monthly reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| All these agencies will now report monthly performance data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| and then that's part of their monthly reimbursement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| And let me make the point that one of the things you'll see in this MOU is that they're backdated to July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| so that expenses that these agencies might have anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| will be eligible for reimbursement by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| So we're trying to hold them harmless financially to make sure that they can continue to do the good work they do uninterrupted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7383)|
| 2:03:10| but we felt like we needed some sort of agreement in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| and this is, under the circumstances, the best arrangement that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| Part of this report, which I'm going to ask for every month, is the month of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| Seymour had 104 calls, and they made it to 98 of those because six of them were terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7401)|
| 2:03:30| So that's quite a few calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| Mr. Bate, to your question, you'll see there is a similar form available for all agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| and I would be remiss if I didn't point out that that form was developed by Mrs. Holden on our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7419)|
| 2:03:46| in the past couple of months, and we think it holds a lot of promise for how we're going to work with these agencies going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7426)|
| 2:03:53| If you would, send that to Drew so she can forward it on to all of us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| And I want to thank Mayor Jacobs. Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| I want to thank the mayor's office and Congressman Burchett now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| If you've not been out to Station No. 2 on Chapman Highway yet, we're going to have a ribbon cutting pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| It's not going to be very big, but please go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| It's been remodeled. We've got sleeping quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| We've got a bay where all the maintenance will be done on the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| It's turned into a beautiful station out there, and it's a great asset for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| And, Commission, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| And to Congressman Burchett and Mayor Jacobs, I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| And I'll throw Caldwell in there because I always go to Caldwell and ask for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| All right. The motion for this is properly before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| Excuse me. Sorry. Back to you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| I know some of the agencies are here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| I don't know if they want to speak tonight, but I noticed a few in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| Mr. VandeVeit, could you remind us who's on the committee, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| And, again, this is an ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| I don't know if he considers himself our chair, but we consider Commissioner Enders our chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| He hosts our meeting and organizes them and keeps us focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| So, Commissioner Enders, myself, Mrs. Holden, who's also from our staff and runs the Homeland Security Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7515)|
| 2:05:21| so she's 15 years of experience in working with first responders and emergency service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| Perry Benshoof, who's the controller for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| Larry Hutzel with the Health Department who ran the MMRS and has been involved in emergency medical services for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7529)|
| 2:05:36| myself, and David Brace from the city is a member of the committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7536)|
| 2:05:43| And what engagement do you have with the agencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| I mean, are you including them in these discussions, or is it your group essentially making decisions for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7547)|
| 2:05:53| Well, what I'd say, Commissioner, is we haven't had them to the one actual meeting we've been able to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| It is our intent to engage them, but we've been pretty limited by the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| So, ultimately, we'll be engaged with them more than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| We did meet with them to go over the MOUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| They actually had surprisingly few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| I attribute that to the fact that Jenny's worked with them for so many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| and much of this garbage comes out of agreements that they've already seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| So, it's a pretty familiar space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7585)|
| 2:06:26| The reporting form that Commissioner Daley alluded to is a good instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| And one of the things that it does is it gives them a chance to brag on work that they otherwise wouldn't get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| like mutual aid runs and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| So, for the time that we've had, it has been very smooth sailing so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| But the time we have has been pretty limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| And just to understand the process, and the goal is to go to the mayor with recommendations by October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7606)|
| 2:06:54| and then that would come to us in October or November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| I'd say probably November in order because the January 1st will be the end of these MOUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| and the midpoint of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Obviously, these agencies are going to need new funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| So, we would be back before this body with a request for funding to get them through the second half of FY21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7628)|
| 2:07:17| and then hopefully a more comprehensive and full set of recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| as Commissioner Anders alluded to, for the budget year, FY22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| So, everything has just basically been rolled forward a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| and this is an interim step to make sure everybody is funded and operational during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7650)|
| 2:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| You mentioned that everybody is currently operating under defined service contracts that I think are a year old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| Is that correct or so, out of a three-year term, if I understood it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| They're currently, before this, they've been operating under that defined service contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| That was true for Seymour and for Knox County Rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| Carnes Fire was operating under a designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| We want to put them under a contract as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| So, now one improvement here will be everybody will be under some sort of formal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| these MOUs if approved by commission, and then next year we intend for everybody to be under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7694)|
| 2:08:15| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7695)|
| 2:08:16| Why was the, I mean, why not keep the two that are under defined service contracts under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| is it just under the ones that they're currently under versus sort of putting them in new ones that are temporary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| Because they're under a contract now that has termination clauses and all kinds of provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| Those contracts extend for a full year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| and we felt like we wanted to do this six-month model in case we had recommendations to the mayor come January that might change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7716)|
| 2:08:43| Does it concern you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| One thing that did concern me, I think Commissioner Daley alluded to it, is the term of cancellation is a matter of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7724)|
| 2:08:51| I can't imagine an agency having, you know, a provision that could be a matter of days from operational and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7731)|
| 2:09:00| functional to how are we going to keep the lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| Does that, I mean, does that concern you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| Or did the group put that particular timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| I think it was five or seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| It's insanely fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| You've got pretty experienced public safety professionals that populate this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| I would consider that basically just in the event of an absolute disaster where there was some event at the agency where they simply couldn't function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7756)|
| 2:09:28| It's certainly not going to be an arbitrary decision on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| We need the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| That's why we put the agreements together, and that's why we've been partners with these agencies for all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| But if something should happen within the agencies themselves, we need some protection for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| Back to you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| Yeah, I just wanted to touch on some things that Dwight did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| He very, as usual, was very eloquent in his discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| But I think we're talking about MOUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| We're talking about response plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| We're talking about everything in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| And so it's not just a funding mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| It's everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| Delivery of service and efficient delivery of service and effective is where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| It's really just hopefully close out some of the discussion from the fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| If nobody wants to jump on board, it would be a consideration for everybody to subscribe to all these as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7814)|
| 2:10:25| And then we don't have these funding issue questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| We don't have somebody getting a bill for $40,000 after their house just burnt down because they're not a member of rural Metro or Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7828)|
| 2:10:35| And so, I mean, those are some of the things that we need to address as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7835)|
| 2:10:40| We're half a million strong, and we have spent less than a million dollars on public safety outside of the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| And I think that's embarrassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| So that's why the committee is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| This motion is probably before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| And seeing no other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| This is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| Please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| Real quick, here's what's going to happen tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| I'm going to bring one more item, and then we're going to take a 10-minute break and then come back and reconvene and go into a brief recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7864)|
| 2:11:12| The item that is just a housekeeping item, it's item 61, which was the second reading related to the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7872)|
| 2:11:21| So let's knock that one out and take a quick 10-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| Could I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| Motion to move with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| We have the proper motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker, and that second was Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| All in favor of sending that one forward with no recommendation, that's item 61, Resolution 0-20-7-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7892)|
| 2:11:43| Consideration of an Ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| Amending Knox County Code, Chapter 58, Article 3, Entitled Hotel Occupancy Tax to Remove Exceptions in the Definition of Hotels for Rentals and Residential Listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7906)|
| 2:11:55| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7918)|

| 2:12:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| Birthday Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| Hey, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7928)|
| 2:12:16| Oh, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| I'm not going to announce that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| I don't think he loves me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| Hey, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| This meeting is now back in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| Got all the stuff on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| We still have an awful lot of things that we want to get through tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| Let's do kind of a quick review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| And, you know, we may not get to every single discussion item, but I know we've got two items from Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7956)|
| 2:12:43| We've got a question about a procurement thing that might be probably a pretty brief one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| And then when we get towards the back of it, a handful of these are simple readings around road closures and several other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7968)|
| 2:12:56| I know Commissioner Bussler brought one discussion item to us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| What I'd kind of like to do is like my question about my discussion item about RE-ORG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| We can easily do that at next week's Board of Commissioners meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| That will be very brief just to verify times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| And I know we've had a few other folks who wanted to speak at public forum come in tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| We're going to keep public forum where it is on the agenda, get through our stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| and any other guests who want to speak at public forum, we'll get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| That's item 72 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| What I will do is I want to go ahead and just knock out the commission item from Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| Then we will circle back to items 51, 52, 53 and go through trying to finish the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8011)|
| 2:13:37| So that's the plan for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| So, Commissioner Bussler, you'd go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| Madam Clerk, could you read his discussion item in to the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| This is on page 11, item number 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| It's a discussion item regarding the Health Department and their actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| sanitation and sterilization on the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8032)|
| 2:13:58| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| While I was bringing this thing up, I'm in an age group that is very frightened by what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| And some of them are just afraid to walk outside the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| And there's a lot of things that we need to find out and let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| and give them some sort of comfort in knowing that we can mitigate some of the situations that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8059)|
| 2:14:26| And one of the things is how do we sterilize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8066)|
| 2:14:30| I mean, a lot of us wear a cloth mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| How often do you wash those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| Do you wash them every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| Do you use Clorox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| You know, washers and dryers now do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| The washer does not do straight hot water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| You can't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| It's just the way it is because of our energy consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| So what temperatures do we have to have the water at to sterilize this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| Is the virus affected by freezing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| Can you freeze the virus and then unfreeze it, you know, if it's on meats and things of that sort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8098)|
| 2:15:03| And they're asking all these questions, and they don't have the answers that we get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| We know one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| They say it's on droplets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| It can only be transferred from human to human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| There have been lip – sorry, Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8118)|
| 2:15:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| There have been limited cases of humans passing it to animals, such as pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| Those are very, very, very, very limited cases, like three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| But those exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| But transmission is primarily human to human through droplets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| That's why wearing a face mask works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| That's why washing your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| There are five really simple things everybody can do to protect themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| Maintain social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| Try to stay more than six feet apart from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| Wear a face mask when you can't do that because face covering is adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| It needs to cover your nose and your mouth, not just your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| Not a chin strap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| It's a face mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| And wash your hands regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| That prevents a whole lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| And then staying home if you're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| That's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| And cleaning surfaces frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| You can go to EPA's website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| and they have a list of approved cleaners that are okay to use that help prevent coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8175)|
| 2:16:21| And then another really great resource is the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| Lots of information, very user-friendly information on the CDC's website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| as well as the World Health Organization's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| It actually has this really great MythBuster section on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| and you can link to those websites from our website, the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| and find that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| And our website is also a really great resource for our community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| And anyone who has questions about COVID-19 can always call 2-1-865-215-5555,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8204)|
| 2:16:50| and they don't know the answer right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| They can help get that answer back to the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| So lots of different resources for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| Telephone calls are every other now it's Tuesdays and Thursdays, press briefings at 1230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8218)|
| 2:17:06| Information is given out there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| Our website, CDC website, Tennessee Department of Health website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| World Health Organization website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| And just pick up the phone and give us a call if you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| There's a lot of people, though, in my age group likes to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| somebody face-to-face and get information there instead of texting and all what you're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8242)|
| 2:17:28| But here's the thing about testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| You're talking about, you know, to find out if you have it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| Rapid testing versus the five- to seven-day test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8257)|
| 2:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| Which is the best one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| The best test is called a preliminary chain reaction test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| So that's a swab in your nose or in your throat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| That's the most accurate test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| It's the closest to what we would call a gold standard for COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| COVID-19 is so new we don't really have a gold standard yet because it's just not been around long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| So the rapid PCR is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| The one that takes, generally they're not taking five to seven days right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8284)|
| 2:18:08| It's 48 to, I can't do the math now, 48 to 72 hours now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| So two to three days turnaround time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| So the one that takes longer is a little more accurate but not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| But the most important thing for people to know is the one that swab in your nose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| or swab in your throat is the one that you need to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| Most doctor's offices are able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| The health department is doing that testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| A lot of walk-in and urgent care clinics are doing it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| Most insurances are covering it if you're symptomatic, if you have symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| I think some insurances are not covering it if you're not symptomatic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| but you have to call your insurance company to find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| And there's a number on the back of your card that you can call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| Again, to be positive, you're talking about if you have insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| you don't have insurance, who's paying for it, things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| Most of the people want to know how can they take care of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8338)|
| 2:19:02| Those five things I mentioned at the beginning are the best way to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| and reduce your disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| And you're talking about the swabbing in the nose and in the throat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| So you're getting the virus through your mouth and through your nose, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| It's droplets that you breathe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| That's the most common way you get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| The droplets we're talking about are not like the big droplets you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| when somebody sneezes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| Those are droplets, but those are big droplets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| They're smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| The other way you can get it is you can, in limited ways, get it off surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| That's why we say wash your hands all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| because if you do that and you touch your eye or touch your nose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| you could put the virus in your eye or in your nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| It's got to enter through what's called a mucous membrane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| so that's your mouth, nose, eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8385)|
| 2:19:46| So a clear plastic front would be better for you than just a regular mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8386)|
| 2:19:52| No, sir, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| It's not a substitute for a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| A face shield is used for specific reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| If you're afraid you're going to have some splatter and get something in your eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| which is not an every-day occurrence, it's generally in medical professions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| So the shields that we're using in stores and things like that to protect the people behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| like the people that are ringing up the cash register person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8410)|
| 2:20:17| that shield in front of them is not as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| Well, I thought you were talking about the face shield that somebody wears on their head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| That's also a face shield, too, but it's not fully protecting it like a mask would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8422)|
| 2:20:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| So the plexiglass is helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| It is helpful in reducing risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| Now, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| You're tested and we get false tests and we get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| showing that you do have it and then you retest and you don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| Now, when you do test positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| how often should you retest to make sure that you got rid of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| You shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| If you get a positive test, there's no reason to test again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| Your employer shouldn't require you to have one again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| You can actually test positive for weeks to months after recovery with this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| And those, so the PCR test is looking for genetic material from the virus, RNA and DNA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8469)|
| 2:21:17| So dead virus has the same genetic material as live virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| so dead virus can make you look positive when you're recovered, when you're totally recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| So the other thing, you talked about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| One was the accuracy of the test, the false positive rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8488)|
| 2:21:33| So that means you have the disease but your test was negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8493)|
| 2:21:39| Now, that's, sorry, false negative rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| I said the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8501)|
| 2:21:42| False negative rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| You have the disease but your test was negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| That's around 30% with this test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| The false positive rate, that's somebody who tests positive for the disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| but doesn't have the disease, it's only about 5% or maybe less with this particular test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8511)|
| 2:21:57| and with this particular disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8519)|
| 2:22:00| If you have a positive test, you probably have the disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| Now, why would it maybe test differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| Part of it might be that, part of it is that the amount of virus you shed changes over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| The other part is that different tests have different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| can pick up different numbers of virus particles, everywhere from 10 to 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8536)|
| 2:22:24| So the test varies depending on where you get it and who performs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| To be honest, if you get a positive test, you really need to isolate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| and you need to stay home and treat it like it's positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| This is a really serious disease that has very serious consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8554)|
| 2:22:38| and we've got to take it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8560)|
| 2:22:41| Now, the thing that we're looking at here too is I was looking at the CIDRAP reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8561)|
| 2:22:49| I'm not sure what you're speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| I guess Dr. Osterham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| I'm not, what CIDRAPS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| C-I-D-R-A-P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| It's a COVID-19 study that's done out, I think, through Minnesota or something like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8578)|
| 2:23:05| that gives us, they gave scenarios back some time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| about three different scenarios of how this virus goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| and they've also said that this virus will never go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| We'll have to contain it, but we don't have anything right now to contain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8596)|
| 2:23:22| We don't have, you know, anything that we can do for vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| And what happens to our schools right now if you do have a positive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8609)|
| 2:23:36| Does the whole school close down or are you going to go to something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| I'm just throwing these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| Before you answer that, I know you can't answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| but these are things that are coming in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| Are you going to put everybody in quarantine in that school or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8629)|
| 2:23:56| What we've done here and what people are afraid of is exactly what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| If you have a business and you say, okay, this business has got COVID-19 in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8642)|
| 2:24:10| then you shut it down for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| But what we've done is we shut businesses down and run them out of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| and we get 90% of our sales tax dollars from small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8657)|
| 2:24:24| So it seems like we've cut our nose off the spider face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| but I know we've got to hold on to this just like we did for HIV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| Zars and all like this other kind of flus we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8675)|
| 2:24:38| This year I understand we're going to be vaccinated for four different kinds of flus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8678)|
| 2:24:45| May I correct you, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8685)|
| 2:24:48| Every year, every flu vaccine has now four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| It used to be just three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| Four strains of the flu in the vaccine every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| because those are the most likely ones to circulate around the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8698)|
| 2:25:02| and in this country every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| So there are two A's and there are two B's in every vaccine that everybody gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| And that's the way it's been for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| That's not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| That's not different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| It's one shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8712)|
| 2:25:13| And you have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| So we're going to be four again this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| and hopefully we'll have one for the COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8716)|
| 2:25:20| So if we're going to be doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| we've got to make sure that the people understand that that's what we'll have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| to try to get rid of this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| The second thing I want to ask about is how we do the accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| And I wanted to know, do we die with the COVID-19 or we die because of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8733)|
| 2:25:41| Because on a death certificate it talks about the disease condition in which you died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| Now, you may go in with a terminal illness but catch the virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| and it depends upon how they write this up to show that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| the death was totally by COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| So if we're not getting true records on what they died with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| say they had terminal cancer or they had some sort of heart disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| and this sort of thing, I know it's a contributing factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| but it's not the reason that they died from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| And it's scaring people to death not to go in to do their cancer test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| and all like this because it's so they're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| How can we go from this point on, besides going online and all this other stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| when some people don't have online services and things of that sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200817?start=8791)|
