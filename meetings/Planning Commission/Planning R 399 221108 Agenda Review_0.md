| 0:00:34| Agenda Review Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| At this time, I'll turn it over to Director Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=37)|
| 0:00:43| Thank you very much, Mr. Till.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=43)|
| 0:00:45| Thank you, Commissioners, for being here and other members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| the staff and city and county staff and the audience here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| This is our monthly agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=52)|
| 0:00:54| the review agenda topics for the November 11th Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:01:00| Commission meeting, which will be held in this same room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| beginning at 1.30 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=63)|
| 0:01:08| We have just a few announcements on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| You have before you, I believe, is a 2022 Center of Population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| Report that Cherry and Aubrey on our staff and on our graphics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| folks just recently put together that looks at the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| trends that have occurred in the last ten years and identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| the center of Knox County's population as well as the states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| and the national population, but also gives interesting trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| for the various sectors of population growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| building permit growth of that for our county over the past ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| We hope at December's meeting to give you a presentation of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| by Aubrey on the report and other demographic data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| The second thing I want to announce is just the advance Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| the effort by Knox County, Knoxville-Knox County Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| and other partners to develop a comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| and transportation plan has been underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| We completed the second round of public involvement as of October 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| and that was from a public input perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| We received a tremendous amount of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| Approximately 3,400 survey responses were returned during that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| We believe we hit about over 3,800 folks of various types of contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| through that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| So a very good tool that we used with MetroQuest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| It allowed folks to really be engaged online at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| and we also had a number of meeting inbox efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| and Zoom meetings that we conducted and held for this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| So a lot of work was put in by county staff, our consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| and planning staff in pulling that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| So our consultants are now looking at all the data and the responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| and would hope in about two weeks be able to have sort of a data summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| of the responses that we received to the survey and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| Mr. Welch, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| When do you expect that a preliminary presentation will be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| I missed the last meeting, but I don't know if Kathy or Jim knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| After the first of the year, I think we were looking for a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| with the planning commission, if I'm not mistaken, Jim or Kathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| Probably don't have the schedule in front of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| but we'll get back to you on that, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| How does that sound?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| With that, I have no other announcements to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| We have a presentation here on missing middle housing study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| and analysis that was done for the city of Knoxville by our consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| Then we have a number of items that we would like to review with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| The list looks long, but as staff we've talked that we want to move through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| them fairly quickly and take questions that you may have regarding those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| So with that, I'll turn it over to Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| Is she available or are the consultants not available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| We can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Well, Ms. Brooks is available, but our consultants, Opticus Design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| are leading the presentation and they haven't logged in yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| so I make a recommendation that you all continue on with your agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| and then move them further down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| You just can't get away from us, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| No, just can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Ordering us around, too, just like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| Okay, we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| The agenda items, if Michelle or, excuse me, Liz Albertson is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=283)|
| 0:04:51| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Yes, speak closer to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Yes, I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| So I think we need to discuss agenda item number 14 and agenda item number 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| This is an application for a rezoning, a one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| and a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| One of the applicants is the city of Knoxville on a smaller acreage that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| 0.6 acres, and then the larger acreage, which is 4.46 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| is a private developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| The applicant is Rivers Edge II, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| And both applicants are asking to rezone to the RN-5 zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| from the existing south waterfront to zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| To accomplish this, they need a one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| and this would involve an extension of the south waterfront mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| two district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| This is part of the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| and it allows consideration of the residential zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| They also need a one-year plan amendment, or sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| a sector plan amendment, and this would be for a transitional designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| between the more intensive south waterfront area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| and the residential areas that it's adjacent to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| So they would be going to medium density residential slash office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| And staff is recommending to approve medium density residential office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| and for the sector plan amendment and then the one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| we're recommending to approve the extension of south waterfront two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| and we are also recommending to extend RN-5 in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| because it's also adjacent to RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| I've got some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Just to understand, if either of 14 or 16 impact the ongoing discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| about Hillwood Avenue and the potential changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| So that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| I attended a meeting last week with the city of Knoxville that's organizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| that sort of effort with Hillwood Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| and the private developer attended that meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| And they are in discussions with some sort of improvement project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| for Hillwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| And I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| this larger project will necessitate a traffic impact study potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| I believe they're going to propose multifamily at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| so they would more than likely have to do some sort of improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| So I think they're going to try to coordinate with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| So in terms of whichever way this case goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| or if it was to move towards staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| the improvements to Hillwood would not be negatively impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| They could still take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| No, the city is supportive of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| They are one of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=484)|
| 0:08:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Waiting for technology to catch up with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| Michelle Portier will address items 22, 11, 12, and 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| primarily once we get hooked up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=504)|
| 0:08:36| That's still not my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=516)|
| 0:08:56| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Can you guys hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| Sit closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| The mic doesn't seem to be particularly strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| So the cases that I'm going to go over all have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| with the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| so we're just going to talk about them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| So if you guys remember, the study objective was to develop an approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| for managing and envisioning development and redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| along the Alcoa Highway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| The first goal out of the three that we recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| is what we're going to be looking at today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| So that goal was to allow a broader array of land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| along the Alcoa Highway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| So there is currently a mixed-use special district land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| for the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| and just as a quick reminder we talked about a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| extending that and then amending the land use class within the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| to include a list of allowed zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| So in going over to the KGIS map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| this is the sector plan component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| So if we look at, there's a list that's included in your packet of parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| and some of those already have the mixed-use special district designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| and for those, those are only going to be impacted by the text amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| to the sector plan, which is adding those zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| to the mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| The parcels that have other designations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| those are the ones that we're including in the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| to be changed to the MUSD designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| So for example, looking at the map, this is the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| So if it's already got that purple hatch on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| it's already mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| therefore all that's changing is the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| These parcels that have the red, the yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| that's general commercial office, MDRO, those designations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| those are what we are recommending to be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| to include that mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| The mixed-use special district allows residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| and commercial development, so it would be providing more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| to the property owners that are along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| We've worked with the property owners as part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| Alcoa Highway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| We've worked with business owners as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| and then all the owners and people within 250 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| of all these properties have received postcards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| and have not received any word of opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| The only change that we're making that is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| from what was in the Alcoa Highway Corridor Studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| is the two parcels that you can see on the screen right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| They are currently used as single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| There's a single-family house here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| They're zoned R and 1, but the land-use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| is ROW, which is really incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| So we're recommending to add these two parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| to what was included in that corridor study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| to make these in USD as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| I've reached out to that landowner and discussed it with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| She's in support of it, has no issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| But again, you can see here the zone, they're R and 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| so the right-of-way designation on that land-use class is in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| So we're hoping to make that correction as part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| And then, again, on the map, you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| so basically we're proposing on the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| to extend it south of the railway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| to where it's just south of Icy King Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| and then on the west side, we're extending it south to Maloney Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| and then on the north, picking up those two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| And then same thing on this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| It's a little bit more intermingled, but the end goal is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| same end point, same start point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| And then when looking at the actual zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| in the mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| just as a reminder prior to this or as it is currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| it allows commercial, office, and medium to high-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| just in general as a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| So any zone that was commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| or any zone that was included in medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| or high-density residential would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| That's not necessarily in keeping with the character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| So for this city, we're proposing CG1 and CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| to be allowed zones within the mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| and in the county CA and CB and CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| There's currently a shopping center in there currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| but we're not proposing to add that as a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| We feel like it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| So the intensity of the zone, the description of the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| doesn't really meet what's going on in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| So any parcel that's currently zoned SC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| would be legal nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| It could remain in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| It's just if somebody wanted to rezone a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| SC wouldn't be one of those zones that they could rezone that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| without getting a sector plan or one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| or a sector plan because it's SC's county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| So with that said, you also have case number 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| which is the ordinance amendment for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| and we are adding research and development to be permissible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| as a special use in the CG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| I know we talked a little bit about the fact that there's UT property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| that's really nearby to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| They have their own research park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| but a lot of what we're hearing from the realtors in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| that have some commercial properties is that the pricing of the UT parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| that are in that R&D, their area is really too expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| and they're getting priced out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| so this would maybe provide a close alternative to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| So they're still near UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| They're still near a lot of amenities that would be beneficial to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| but at a lower price point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| that could maybe help spur some development along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| So we're adding it as a special use since it would apply citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| So that's the cases that are going before you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| That is the 11C22SP for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| and then in the city you've got 11A22PA and 11B22SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| So that's all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Next month we'll have the county components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| their ordinance amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| but it's been postponed to this month to allow us a little bit more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| to tweak that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| We'll continue to move on then until, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| our consultants get online for the missing middle housing support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| Switching up with Jesse Hillman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| we'll take over with items 13, 17, and 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=913)|
| 0:15:24| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| So with item number 13, this is rezoning case 10C22RC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| We discussed this at last agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| This is the parcel at the terminus of Hancock Street that was going to be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| initiated by the city to industrial mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| It is now being postponed again and amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| The property owner will now be the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| and they're actually asking to include the adjacent property just to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| which they also own, to be included in that application to rezone to IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| And if you have any additional questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| Amy's prepared to speak about the city outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| Jesse, do you know what the status of the site is environmentally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| The status of the site in terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Remediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Is there remediation required, and what are the issues with the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| I would assume with a major fire that in recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| you might have some significant ground contamination, but that's just a speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| Yeah, I don't have more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| That will certainly be a part of the review consideration as it's reviewed for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1001)|
| 0:16:57| So moving along to agenda number 17, 11A22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| This is a property at 2031 and 2033 Piney Grove Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1024)|
| 0:17:13| The applicant is requesting to zone to RN1 from agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| I'm sorry, from RN1 to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| It's a down zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| As you can see in the zoning slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| It's a lone RN1 parcel as part of a grouping to the north of ten lots that are all agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1047)|
| 0:17:38| This property was rezoned to RN1 in 2005, but before that it was also agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:49| The Northwest County Sector Plan has this designated as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| and the ag zone is one of the recommended zones for that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| In the aerial, you can see I'll point out that the applicant also owns the two parcels just north of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| You can see there's a private driveway that accesses all three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1089)|
| 0:18:19| It is our recommendation that we can't technically recommend approval of agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| because the parcel is one acre in size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| which does not conform with the five-acre minimum lot standard for agricultural properties in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| However, it is worth noting that the applicant intends to merge their three lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| which would bring them all closer into compliance with that minimum lot size at three acres total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| We don't believe that the agricultural zoning would necessarily have negative impacts on surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| The photo to the top shows the private drive that separates these lots from surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| There's also a privacy fence along the southern border with the townhome subdivision to separate those land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1139)|
| 0:19:08| Again, this would be returning the property to its original zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| and enable the owner to bring these lots closer into compliance with ag district standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Hey, Jessie. What is the applicant doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| Are they doing something that needs to be ag? Is that why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| Yes. They are looking to have a few goats and chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| Goats and chickens, I believe, are what they're looking to have on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| We'd like to have a mini animal farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Okay. And you can't have goats permanently in the city, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| Unless it's ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| You can have chickens, though, a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Up to six, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| So are they in a tight timeline, or could they resub, do a resub plat, and then rezone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1201)|
| 0:20:13| So they would submit a replat after having this, if it's zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| They would ask that it all be merged into a three-acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| which is kind of shown in that blue border at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| Those are the three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| They're seeking to have them all zoned the same before replatting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| And it was ag prior to recode or farther back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| It was ag prior to 2005 when the prior owner zoned it residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1244)|
| 0:20:56| Jessie, if this were five acres, would you recommend rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Is there a way to guarantee that they would combine it with the other lots to make a conforming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:11| Right now they couldn't get a permit, correct, for anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| If it was rezoned agriculture, they wouldn't be able to get a permit for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| because it doesn't meet the minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| I would defer to building permits and inspections on their interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| If all three were merged, it would be more in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| I don't know if it would prohibit them from being able to have animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| since that is a use allowed in the ag zone by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| It looks like there's a lot of buildings on those other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| or it looks like there's a lot of different structures on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| Are they going to be able to be in compliance if they merge those lots with all of those buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| So they're looking to demolish the bottom one on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| It's been condemned, and their intention is to upgrade the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| and really have one primary residence and the rest be used for their small farming operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| Is there some reason why they couldn't do the re-flats and find those before rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| No, I think they just thought it would be a cleaner operation to have it all the same consistent zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| and then merge it as an agricultural lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| But from the city and planning standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| is it feasible or doable to first flat it and then change the zoning in that section of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1361)|
| 0:22:50| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| I'll defer to Michelle on how to merge first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1372)|
| 0:23:05| I can speak to this a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| When someone turns in a subdivision flat, re-review that flat under the zoning that's in place at the time of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| So if someone were to try to re-flat a property under a zone that wouldn't allow the lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| we wouldn't be able to accept it until it was already zoned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| So in this case, if there's not a minimum, I guess if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1403)|
| 0:23:32| Sounds like a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| I'm sorry. They should flat it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| I'm sorry. I was kind of coming in on the tail end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| So they could flat the property first and get it up to that five acres and then come in and rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| So it kind of works both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| But yeah, in this instance, because they're combining the properties, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| They're not trying to subdivide it to make it smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| They're making it bigger, and it doesn't have to be, so it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1440)|
| 0:24:09| I'm not sure what it's fine means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| Like, is it fine that we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| I guess, does this change staff's recommendation at all with this dialogue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| Or is there any additional recommendation that could be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| Because it sounds like we have options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| So I'm not sure what it's fine means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| At least my understanding is that, I mean, if you approve it, then he can move forward with what he wants to be able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| the applicant wants to do, just that we're just in a little tight spot here from a staff recommendation standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| So I haven't looked at these properties to see, like, what all the lot sizes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| So what exactly is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| I mean, I would have to look at it more specifically to understand exactly what it would be that would be coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| So that square, do we know what the lot size of that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| That total lot size, if they were merged, it would be three acres, not five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| So if that's the case, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| For someone to plot the property, the zoning would have to allow the lot size for the lot that they're trying to plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| So if they're asking for ag and there's a five acre minimum, then they would have to plot at least five acres to create the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:33| So that would be our take in terms of the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| They'd have to get a variance for the lot size, which isn't something that would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| Because the subdivision regulations, they refer to the zoning for the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| And so this board doesn't have the ability to provide a variance for a lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| That would be a BZA thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| But then the BZA also can't create a nonconforming lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| So in that sense, it is like a chicken and an egg sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Like, there's really not a way around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| So for them to be able to do it, they would either have to plot a property with at least five acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| or they could pick another zone that allowed what they wanted to do that allowed less than five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1568)|
| 0:26:16| unless this body wanted to approve the ag zoning without having that five acres of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| If they want to combine and have ag, the only path would be for them to replot it first as residential and then request rezone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1583)|
| 0:26:32| I'm sorry, can you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| If they want to get to what they want, they would have to replot first and then request rezone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| No, because the plot would have to – we review it under the zoning that's in place at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| So the lot size, all of that stuff would have to meet the zoning requirements for us to be able to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| As R and 1, they could replot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Right, and then request rezone, and then they would – if we approved that, they could then have a three-acre ag lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| You're saying if they rezoned the other two parcels to R and 1, then they could combine all three and then go to ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1627)|
| 0:27:15| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| No, it seems the only path for them to get what they want is for them to replot everything as it is right now as residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| and then request rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| So currently the two properties to the north are ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| Only the one to the south is part of this rezoning application, and they're requesting ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| If it were approved as ag, then there would be three existing agricultural lots that he would be seeking to merge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1655)|
| 0:27:45| But could it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| But that still wouldn't give them the five-acre minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| We're pretty much at the bottom already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| There are some times where if someone's making a non-conforming situation better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| that we could look at that as maybe allowing it because it makes it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| But I wouldn't be able to make a blanket statement whether or not we would be inclined to approve that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| I don't think there's much we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| It's something we would look at more carefully once the plaque came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| I don't think – I think our hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| I don't think we can recommend a piece of property be rezoned that's not going to meet the minimum qualifications for use in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1693)|
| 0:28:22| Am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| I mean, I'd like to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| We can do anything we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| We'll try to come back with more clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| The only thing I'm seeing here is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| So we'll come back with more clarification for you on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| What I'm seeing here, though, is everything around it is already ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| And the RN-1 maybe shouldn't be RN-1 on that piece of property, even though the property itself is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1717)|
| 0:28:46| But the other properties are already ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| Then it's RN-5 right below it, right south of it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Yeah, below it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| I'm talking about above it, all the yellow area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| Yeah, and to be clear, staff is recommending denial because it is non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| I just wanted to provide full context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| In some of that, I think that the five acres is fairly new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| Under the old zoning, ag. zoning, I don't think we required five acres, so that would be non-conforming, pre-existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| the lots that you're talking about that aren't conforming now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| Once you combine them, it would be non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| It would be closer to conforming than it is now, but it wouldn't be the five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| Yes, Article 17 of the City Zoning Ordinance, which is non-conformities, well, part of it is non-conformities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| does allow the combination of lots of record or deeded lots before a certain date to be combined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1775)|
| 0:29:44| without requiring a variance as long as they're making the non-conformities less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| and in most cases, they will be if they're combining lots together, even if they don't meet the minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| So there'd be a little bit of research on it to determine whether all these lots meet the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| There was a plat for the RN1 lot and the smaller of the other two lots, the one on the right side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1799)|
| 0:30:09| So those two are definitely lots of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| There was a deed from 1932, but I have no idea whether that property has stayed in the exact same boundary since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:23| I guess my last question on that is, it sounds like the applicant, their goal is to combine these eventually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1823)|
| 0:30:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Regardless of the time, would you all be able to touch base with him before Thursday and go through some of his options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1841)|
| 0:30:50| He may want to postpone and take another route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| Yeah, I'll consult with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| What latitude or authority during the plat review would you have knowing that it is a non-conformity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1858)|
| 0:31:10| It doesn't meet the five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| Yeah, so there's typically a date that's associated with that non-conformity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| depending on when the subdivision regulation is at some point in 1971.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| So if it's prior to that or after that, and then I guess how close it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| we could work with the city to see what they would be willing to accept and then what that non-conformity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| So, you know, like Mike said, and like I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| it's not something that can really make a call on today without reviewing it further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| but that's some of the things that we'll look at when we look at non-conformities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| how the city's ordinance handles that, how this applies, and what the separate say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| So it's a combination of all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Question real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| I mean, so is it fair to say that all those other ag lots around it are non-conforming right now as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| I was going to say, I wasn't familiar with the property around it because it's not my case, but I'm hearing yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| Right, I mean, because none of them are five acres is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Yeah, so I mean, it looks to me like everything around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| Yeah, I don't recall what the old lot size was under the A1 zoning that was prior to the ags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| Maybe someone that had worked with that ordinance might remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| That was kind of before I got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| They're probably legal non-conforming is my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| Jesse, when was the R1 plot for that particular lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| Was it ag before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| It was ag before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| It was rezoned in 2005 to what is the equivalent of R1 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| It was R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Maybe that was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| It was R1 when RICO came through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| because they rezoned it from ag to R1, correct, in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| So that's why that lot got the R1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1964)|
| 0:32:57| Jesse, do you have one more case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Are you done with the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| You want me to move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Yeah, then we'll move to the missing middle study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Okay, so item number 26, 11D22RZ, 11A22SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| This property is at 3029 Leg Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| The applicant is requesting to go from agricultural to PR at two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| and a sector plan amendment from agricultural to rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| The hillside protection overlay would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| So in the zoning, you can see that this property is surrounded by agricultural zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| many of which are multi-acre lots and still operating as farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| There is PR zoning to the northwest of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| and that density is one dwelling unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| There's also PR zoning within the planned growth boundary to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| That's at four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| In the sector plan, you can see, again, it's surrounded by agricultural land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| The HP overlay is along a ridge line, which the property is a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| and that low-density residential designation to the south demarcates the rural area boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2049)|
| 0:34:17| So this subject property is in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| In the aerial, you can see the property is mostly wooded hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| consistent with neighboring lots along that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Leg Lane is a narrow connector to the minor arterial of Millertown Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| which is also very narrow with no known plans for expansion or improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| We have seen an increase in traffic counts on Millertown Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| which may be related to the recent development of the Eli Park subdivision to the south there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| Our recommendation is approval of the plan amendment to rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| because it meets the location criteria for that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| However, rural residential recommends a max density of one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| so that's our recommendation for planned residential instead of two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| This would result in three total units instead of six total units on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| And this is in consideration for the narrow roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| It's also consistent with the slope analysis for the property and the rural character of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| including that nearby residential subdivision to the northwest in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| Jesse, do you know what the width of this piece of property is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| What the width of it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| Do you know what the width of it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:36:05| About 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:18| Okay, we'll take a break from reviewing the cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| I believe everyone is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| Ms. Brooks for the missing middle housing study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| I think our consultant team is on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| I'll provide a little introduction here as Liz brings that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| It's really good to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| As some of you might recall, we started a missing middle housing scan last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| The purpose of the scan was to take a look at our relatively new city zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| and adopted plans and identify opportunities for where we could increase housing supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| with housing types that we typically don't see in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| I'll let the consultants dive into the definition of missing middle because it is part of their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| This effort was led by planning staff, the staff that you see in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| as well as Lindsay Crockett and Terry Kahula and his team, Aubrey, Nick, and Alex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| as well as leadership from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| We received financial support from the city as well as from our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| at the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| Specifically, I would like to thank Hanson Sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| CARS Government Affairs and Policy Director, for his support and enthusiasm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| not only just for this work but for all things planning and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| This is really the first presentation of this material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| and we'll be sharing it out with other partners this winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| Today, Tony Perez as well as Russell Toler from Opticos are going to walk you through the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2265)|
| 0:37:53| I'll give you all just a little bio of both of them so you know who's speaking to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2273)|
| 0:38:01| So Tony is a senior associate with Opticos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| He's a leader in advancing missing middle housing and the practice of form-based codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| Tony works with public sector planners in communities across the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| to understand and customize and apply form-based codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| He leads the code reform team at Opticos, and since 2000, he has authored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| or co-authored or peer-reviewed dozens of codes for small neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| suburban shopping center transformations, and citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| Tony has worked as well as a public sector planner in Southern California for 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| Russell Toler is a senior designer with Opticos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| He has experience in both the public and private sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| His experience spans all things planning-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| He excels in helping clients produce clear and concise documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| that help clarify regulations and help shape future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| He has taken a lead role in the development of several form-based codes and code audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| This presentation is going to cover, as I mentioned, what is missing middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| where can missing middle housing work best in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| and I want to put in the caveat that this potentially doesn't need to just apply to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| There might also be opportunities in the future for this type of housing to occur in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| and especially given the advanced Knox planning effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| there's an opportunity to think proactively about where this development would be most appropriate in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| They'll also talk about the barriers to missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| and give you all an opportunity for question and answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Now I'll turn it over to Russell and Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Thank you all for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2369)|
| 0:39:39| Amy, is that our cue to go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Thank you, Amy, and thank you, Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Thank you, Chair Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Thank you very much for having us and letting us do this work for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| We've been asked to make this presentation in 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| so we're going to go briskly through what missing middle is and what it isn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| some of the distinctions between it and multifamily, regular multifamily development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| and then because we have a limited amount of time to present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| we're going to present to you the key findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Russell is going to dig into that later in the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| and then the kinds of barriers that a lot of jurisdictions across the country see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| so that you can compare the types of barriers that we found in your regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| and policy documents, compare them to other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| So I'm going to share my screen here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| and let me know if everybody can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| Is that working for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| Okay, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| Okay, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| All right, so what it is, where can it work best in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| and to your point, Amy, where it can work best anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| but we specifically worked on the city of Knoxville and the barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| So why do we call it missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| You know, you hear some people across the country drop the missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| and they just started calling it middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| The reason we call it missing middle housing is that over the past 75, 80 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| for a lot of good reasons, the emphasis in the market has been on single-family housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| either attached or detached, at one end of the spectrum and at the other end of the spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| all kinds of different choices of apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| And there's just a lot of things that are missing in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| which Dan Parolek made that observation about 12, 13 years ago now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| and he said, you know, we all know of neighborhoods where it isn't just houses and big apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| There are these things called duplexes and fourplexes and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| all these different choices that we all, in some way or another, either lived in or know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| And so we sat around the table one day and said, you know, there's a lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| How do we give people a quick way to say this and to test it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| to understand when they know they see it and when they know it's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| We came up with this three-line description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| house-scale buildings with multiple units and walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| And as you're going to see here through our presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| a lot of multifamily development is one or two of these, but it's usually not three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| And missing middle development is always all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| So we, you know, people sometimes say, well, you guys aren't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| you're not inventing anything new. We're not saying we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| We're just trying to bring attention back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| Something that was happening as a matter of course, 100 years ago in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| You could get a Sears catalog like this on the screen here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| and order for yourself a fourplex, eight, 10, 12plex and fit it to your lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| It's interesting. You look at the arrows at the bottom there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| one says this house can be built in a lot, 40 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| and the other one for a 50 foot wide lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| And somewhere along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| our zoning rules diverged from the actual buildings that they used to fit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| lots and they became more abstract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| And you could see that back a hundred years ago, you could just order this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| It would give a size to fit your lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| So the pallet of missing middle types that we tend to see over and over across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| country by different names in different areas, are these a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| we're going to walk through them here, but I, you know, this is a way of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| this is a pallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| It's not as a everything has to happen in every neighborhood, in every city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| in every place. It's more, Hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| maybe one neighborhood might really benefit from the left-hand side of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| spectrum and another set of neighborhoods or corridor might benefit from the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| the right-hand side of the spectrum or all kinds of other variations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| So just quickly here, just to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| just to go through them and show what we're talking about. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| I think a lot of people are aware of duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| but there are a couple of different varieties in every one of them that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| talking about here goes back to the house scale characteristic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| This looks like a house, one house with one unit in it until you look and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| realize there, there are two entries there with the, with the two porches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| So this is a side-by-side and, and on the right-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| you'll see the associated lot size and the result in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And that's really, really important to keep mind of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| These are densities that these buildings were built to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| These are densities that result of this building being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| That's a big distinction where the density didn't drive these decisions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| densities, but came out of putting these buildings on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| The cousin to the side-by-side is a duplex stack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| So as its name implies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| there's a flat on the second story and there's a flat on the ground story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| And then you can see the entries on both sides of both ends of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| there, but it looks at first glance, it looks like a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| And then this cottage court or bungalow court, you might know it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| or you might know it by another name, but they're one story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| very small footprint buildings around the garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| And then usually with a two-story building at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| as you can see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| sometimes two or three or four units in that back building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| But again, they're all the size of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| This, this four-plex one of my favorites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| this is from Greenville, South Carolina, and it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| it's in a neighborhood of houses with a few duplexes and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| and there's an eight-plex down the street West of here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| but all of these buildings are on lots that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| are the size of single family lots for single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| and the buildings that have more than one unit in them have that house scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| meaning they're not bigger than the houses that they're next to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| This is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| what we call a multiplex small or a mansion apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| You might know it as in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| And at first glance, it looks like a house, but it's five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| And here's this cousin. This is what we call the multiplex large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| So it's still, again, two stories. It's got an occupied attic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| and this can hold anywhere between 12 and maybe 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| 18 units depending on other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| But this is as big as they get. And then courtyards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| there are a couple of different varieties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| but this is the house scale version where it looks like it could be a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| or, or a large single family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| And, and yet it has eight to 12 units in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| And then the townhouse, we break into a couple of varieties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| There are the three-story versions that everybody's familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| But there's also this version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| which is two stories and usually four in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| And so we call this the small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| as opposed to the other one, which would be the large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| And it's a good way to understand how to, how to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| how to allow townhouses of different sizes throughout your city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| And a couple of examples here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| this is a mansion apartment or multiplex small that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| that we are designing in Edmonton, Idaho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| And it's there in the foreground in this picture with other existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| multifamily buildings in this college town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| The, and just quickly, you can see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| the density is almost 20 to the acre for this, for this multiplex small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| Here is an example of a cottage court in Healdsburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| California on just the 1.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| And it comes in a, it comes in a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| it comes in a multiplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Just the 1.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| And it comes in at 8.7 to the acre with 12 cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| Interestingly here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| the developer wanted to do duplexes and fourplexes instead of single unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| but the community put a lot of pressure on the council and they ended up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| approving it as all single unit cottages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| but they still achieved more than they would have otherwise on this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| And then the third example is a new neighborhood that our office designed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| a developer outside of Lincoln, Nebraska in a town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| a city called Papillon, Nebraska there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| And it's, it's I believe it's about 80 acres and it's probably four or 500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| And it's about two thirds built right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| And this is a great case study because the developer is a former apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| developer and, and, and building renovator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| And he just said, I, I want to have as efficient buildings as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| even though it might mean building more buildings than I usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| I don't want any wasted space that it can't rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| And so when you realize that this approach gave him that he didn't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| lobbies, any quarters that he had, he couldn't rent any of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| It was all walk-up development as they, as they call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| And the development is doing very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| Where does missing middle work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| As you can see, here's that example from Greenville, South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| that four four plex there in the foreground of the picture there in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| And it's in and amongst single unit houses and duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| And this street is mostly single unit houses by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| but it it's no bigger than its neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| And so a key characteristic, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| going back to the house scale buildings with multiple units in walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| a key characteristic of missing middle housing as we find it across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| country is that it's in walkable places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| And what that means is there there's something to walk to other than more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| houses. There's, there are services, there's transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| maybe there's employment, maybe there's food, maybe they're shopping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| maybe all of those, maybe just two of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| but there's something to walk to that makes a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| And so the need for cars isn't completely gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| It's just far less because of what you can walk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| So the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| here are three examples in Knoxville that we found of obviously your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| downtown. And then there's a quarter there on Magnolia at Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| And then the the neighborhood serving example here at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| Silverville and, and severed Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| And I'm probably mispronouncing that. So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| So walkable neighborhoods is a big part of, of where these, these occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| And one more word here before I turn it over to Russell, my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| this is really critical because could you put it out in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| nowhere in the, in the, in the agricultural fields? Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| But the parking demand is going to be bigger and everything that the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| will need to, to, to, to not drive their cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| It's just going to make them get in their cars and go somewhere to go get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| those services and everything else, unless that's provided near them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| So, you know, you might say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| we're thinking about a place that doesn't yet have a center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Well, if it had a center in the future, then that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| So our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| our emphasis today is going to be on centers that we found with your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| in Knoxville. So I'll turn it over to Russell here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| Thank you, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| And thank you planning commission for hearing us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| And thank you for staff for making this possible. So this is what we lit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| Up here are the four zones that we studied in our analysis are in two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| three, four, four, and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| And we did that so we could see that in relation to these centers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| Tony was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| These are existing identifiable clusters of places worth walking to and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| neighborhood amenities. They might be parks, schools, transit, goods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| and services. These little dots around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| These are quarter mile distances and a half mile distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| And we use that as a rule of thumb because a quarter mile is about a five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| minute walk. And that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| that's the distance that people tend to feel silly driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| So they opt to walk instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| The 10 minute walk could also be considered just a couple minute bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| ride. So we have those for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| to juxtapose with the four zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| So the topic is missing middle housing, where could it work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| So these would be the opportune places for policy direction to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| to turn its attention to, because as Tony said, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| it's multiple units poured into, into house scale buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| And that last part's important in walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| So next slide, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| And now these are places that have potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| They're not established centers like that last slide you saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| Those were obviously kind of the older parts of town when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| when development patterns were, were naturally in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| These are the places where if it were the desire of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| if it was the intent to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| to allow these places to grow into more walkable neighborhoods with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| walkable amenities and more housing options in our one settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3206)|
| 0:53:35| These would be opportune places where, where that might make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| So you have, you have centers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| They're not as, as identifiable and maybe vibrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| This might just be a corner store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| It might just be one or two destinations, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| but the potential is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| So these would be places where missing middle housing would make a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| sense. Next slide, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| So now we're going to go into the barriers that we found to this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| development within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| We dove into the zoning code and these are the big five takeaways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| These are the big five barriers that we found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| We have all of this fleshed out in a lot more detail and there were other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| smaller things. And those are fleshed out in the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| but the big five, I'll go through them real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| The lack of clarity on intended building scale and a lack of dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| regulation. So like a lot of zoning codes across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| abstract standards are used. So lot area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| lot coverage dwelling units per acre, those things that don't really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| they can't really, they're not predictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| You can't imagine what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| what those regulations are going to generate when it comes to physical form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| of building. So without that, without knowing what, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| what's being aimed for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| that that does pose a barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| The second one is the density metric itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| So some of these zones fall into land use classifications that have density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| rent ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| So are in three and are in four are in a lot of those classifications that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3313)|
| 0:55:21| that caps the density at 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| And as it says on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| only four out of those nine missing middle housing types that Tony went over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| work under 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| So right there that precludes a lot of these, these housing options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| third bullet point housing types and number of units and each are allowed or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| prohibited by zone. This might be the most cut and dry barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| It's, it's a major barrier and it's also easy to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| So the city of Knoxville has four, has divided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| has divided housing development into four major types, single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| two family townhomes and multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| Those are the four types and the development standards are in relation to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| typology. Some of those types are, are prohibited outright in certain zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| Some require special discretionary permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| which poses a barrier. And in some cases there's kind of a mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| but multifamily development is not allowed in our two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| for example. So that's a, that's a major barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| Minimum parking too high for info lots is very common across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| Typically missing middle housing types work well with about one parking space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| per unit. Right now the city of Knoxville has it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| has it by bedroom over two units are required or two parking spaces are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| required for townhomes and with multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| it's a sliding scale depending on how many bedrooms you have and visitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| spaces are required. So as soon as you get over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| one space per unit, one and a quarter spaces per unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| it just doesn't missing middle housing types that we're talking about. Don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| don't become feasible anymore from a design standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| but also from a financial standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Lastly minimum lot area leaves out a lot of smaller infill lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| So, so what the zoning code does now is based on the number of units that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| you're providing, the requisite lot area needs to be bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| So the more units you add in your plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| the larger your lot area needs to be, which filters out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3453)|
| 0:57:40| which, which unintentionally filters out a lot of missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| possibility. So like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| all of this is fleshed out in the report and I'll turn it back over to Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| Yeah. So we, we we're close on time. So we'll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| we'll go through these as briskly as we can. Thank you, Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Just a couple of barriers that we see over and over across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| So you can start to put your barriers into perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| Is this, this, what is intended by multifamily? A lot of policy documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| comp plans, area plans, talk about multifamily being allowed or not allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| but we found it very helpful to go further and to make a distinction between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| house scale buildings and their counterpart or opposite what are called block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| scale buildings. And so how scale buildings are, are missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| just as their name implies. They're the size of small to big houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| And then everything, anything bigger than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| we use the term block scale like you can see here in this 24 unit building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| It's, it's a nice project. It's just not house scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| And then making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| making clear where multifamily is really intended to be house scale at two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| stories and less or up to three or four stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| What we call in the office upper missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| There are cases where upper missing middle makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| As you can see here along these corridors, as we've shown on an aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| So this is important to understand where you do and don't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| And then density, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| density is probably one of the biggest barriers across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| And this is one of my favorite ways of showing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| The building on the left is longer than you could see in the photograph and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| has 49 units in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| The building on the right is a multiplex small or a mansion apartment with five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| units. Yet density wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| numerically the way that the math works out on their, on their parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| they're almost the same exact numerical density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| but they couldn't be more different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| Parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| The approach on the left is tear down your neighbor to satisfy the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| They approach on the right in the same city, which will remain nameless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| uses the opposite uses the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| The size of the lot is where, where the parking occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| whether it occurs in the back down the side in some cases underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| but usually in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| And just they're just two different approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| And so understanding what you are expecting of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| of your projects in terms of parking has a lot to do with what ultimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| outcomes you want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| And then a lot with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| the, the, the standards currently require 8,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| minimum lot area, which translates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| If you have a 50 foot wide lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| it has to be 160 feet deep to, to, to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| to have a couple of units on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| But we know that a fourplex will work on a 50 by 100 foot deep lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| So a requiring 8,000 square feet might have good reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| but it's more than it's necessary to come into fourplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| So with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| we just will stop going through the brisk walk and take your questions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| discuss this with you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3666)|
| 1:01:19| So any questions at the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| Yeah. Thank you for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| One thing I wanted to ask you is did you look at in our new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| ordinance? We currently allow accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| Is that considered missing middle? And have you given any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| any advice to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| how we could encourage more accessory dwelling units developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| since there's not a lot of empty lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| And I would think creating missing metals with duplex or fourplex would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| require redevelopment of a existing piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3713)|
| 1:02:04| Yeah. Accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| Those we did look at those a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| We were really looking at those nine types to keep things very organized in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| those four zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| But accessory dwelling units are definitely part of the same topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| The primary barrier we see to that is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| the required parking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| So currently there's one parking space required per accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| And that could just render the whole project and feasible for a lot of lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| in the city. The other thing is the 10 foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| That may or may not be a problem depending on the light lot size, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| that could filter out a lot of lots in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| So those were the two primary barriers as we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| as we just kind of scanned for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| I wanted to add on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| I think something that we're learning a lot lately is that people ask us for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| standards, you know, to, to create new missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| but often what they're really talking about is I think what you're getting at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| whoever made that question, I don't know if it was Amy or someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| about adding additional buildings to, to an existing law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| an existing law of an existing building and not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| not tearing down what exists, but adding to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| And that is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| that is an approach that a lot of cities are starting to take, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| for a lot of, for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| It seemed like most of the examples at the front of your presentation focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| on historic homes that had been essentially retrofitted to be missile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3822)|
| 1:03:49| missing middle. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Well, they, a lot of those are, are historic, but they weren't retrofitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| They were built that way from the beginning. They, they, they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| they have their individual units and individual kitchenettes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| So they were designed that way. You know, there are new examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| We have found that when we show a contemporary example of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| of some of these buildings, sometimes people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| don't, don't agree with the contemporary approach of design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| And so they'd rather see something a little more historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| So I apologize for only showing historic examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| No, it actually helped me think about things differently because this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| tends to, when approached with missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| only see new structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| And so recognizing that what I had thought of just as retrofitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| as retrofitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| as retrofitting is not going to be the same as retrofitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| So recognizing that what I had thought of just as retrofitted apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| buildings is actually filling a missing middle if handled well is sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| eye-opening. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Yeah. You know, if I could just add to that, there is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| there is a project in Dan's book, the missing middle housing book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| There's a case study of a fourplex in Portland and it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| it's, it's incredible. You know, it's quite a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| quite a feat that they retrofitted it and it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| it was a house and they turned it into a fourplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| And we talked to the economists and the team that worked on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| And they said, you know, we all show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| And it's a great thing that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| but retrofitting an existing building that becomes one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| one of these types is, is not for the faint of heart. It's, it's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| There's a, there are a lot of problems. So we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| we also say that so that sometimes people are not that you're saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3937)|
| 1:05:46| but you made me think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Sometimes people get the impression that we are encouraging people to go into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| neighborhood and cut up houses into like a fraternity house and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| just a little, everybody living in a closet or something like that. But no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| we, as you saw in the, in the Sears catalog, these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| these buildings, when they were built, they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| they were built as outright units, individual units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| So thanks for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| I always think about how things would be financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| The developers that are building these two, these duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| triplexes and fourplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| are they marketing them towards home ownership as if like someone would live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| there as their primary residence and then rent out the other units or are they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| are these strictly rental properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| The, the reality right now is that these tend to be rentals. They, they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| you know, some older buildings are turned into condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| but the newer projects that are being built, if they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| if they're not a duplex or if they're not a townhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| they tend to be rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| And that is only because of all the laws in the building codes that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4024)|
| 1:07:12| distinguish between a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| a four unit house scale fourplex and a multifamily project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| They get thrown into the same boat. And so they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| the banks, the building code and their people are trying to change those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| But right now they tend to lump them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| And so they, they tend to produce rental more than ownership currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| Well, I know right now FHA will finance a duplex up to 538,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| a triplex up to 651,000 and a fourplex up to $809,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4065)|
| 1:07:52| And that's just with a three and a half percent down payment. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| it seems like that would be a really good path for a single person to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| or, or even a family to obtain, you know, a primary residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| but also build some rental income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| I've got a quick question. In other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| other municipalities that you guys have worked in and advised, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| what is your experience with their building codes and tweaking those or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| modifying those to make, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| potentially up to four units easier to build? I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| it's the zoning is one reason why these haven't been built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| but building codes and costs to build more than a duplex in this city seems to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| be another hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| So is there any light that you could shed on some practices around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Well, yeah. I mean, right now it's, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| that's still an issue across the majority of cities that we've run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| But Memphis where we're working is, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| is far down the road and leading the way to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| And they're starting with fourplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| And for the very reasons you just stated there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| I'm not an expert on the actual changes they're making in the building code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| but they're trying to change the building code to not be punitive to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| types of buildings, which it currently, currently is for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| and it's not intentional. It just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| it lumps them together with bigger buildings. So, but they're changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| I'd encourage you to talk to John Zayna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| planning director in Memphis who we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| we prepared the comprehensive plan out there in the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| and we're currently working on their zoning code. Some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| some tweaks and clarifications to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Got a question. Are you finding a reluctance on the part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| of the development community to build three fourplex units versus 150 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| where their economies of scale are so much better? You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| they would rather manage 150 unit in one area rather than having multiple units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| scattered around town with three or four units in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Have you found those issues in other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| Yeah. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| there are builders that are attracted to this and a lot of builders that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| aren't. And usually it tends to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| the missing middle tends to attract the smaller builder contractor type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| developer. For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| the Prairie Queen project outside of Lincoln,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| Nebraska that I mentioned is the largest example that we know of by a former,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4249)|
| 1:10:57| you know, large apartment developer. Otherwise, yeah, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| it's somebody who's doing two fourplexes or, you know, four duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| It's, it's smaller developers usually. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| a lot of times the larger developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| even though they do multiple single family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| they look at these projects and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| I need to have as few buildings with as many units because that's just how our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| model works. They haven't yet switched over to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| hmm, you know, I do a hundred single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| Maybe I could do a hundred fourplexes. They don't, they haven't switched to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| They, they look at it as I need to do two buildings with 50 units in a niche| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| instead of, you know, 25 fourplexes. So yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| the short answer is, is the smaller builders attracted to this more than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| So as, as an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| I've worked on every type of building and housing type that was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4316)|
| 1:12:03| mentioned in the presentation. And I actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| most of our firm's work happens in the areas that were in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| presentation. So first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| if anybody wants to listen to me talk for a few hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| just let me know and I can add to this with a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| But I have a question and to build up to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| a couple comments too, because one thing that I've noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| and this is for us as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| one thing that I've noticed in not just our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| but other communities is a lot of opposition towards missing middle comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| preconceived notions or ideas. And a lot of that is built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| I've heard people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| we don't want renters here because someone's trying to do a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| And there's a lot of problems with that, you know, to begin with, but at the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| but also that the problems aside, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| it is very common for these to be either or to be owner occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| We have a duplex being built right now that is going to be sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| individually as two different houses to different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| It won't be a rental similar with townhouses and even condos and apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| And so this is a really good opportunity for owner occupied housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| And I also, to talk about the developers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| it creates instances for smaller scale developers to be able to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| or to impact their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| I know someone, a client of ours was a therapist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| And he was able to renovate a fourplex and now he, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4423)|
| 1:13:51| he's got tenants and he lives in it and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| And that building prior was causing a lot of problems for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| that is something that maybe a larger developer wouldn't have touched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| but someone who was able to see the potential in it was able to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| And so all that to say, I think that this is essential for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| And the question that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| and really this may be a little bit more for staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| but partially for you all as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| what are our possible action steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Because I've, a few years, a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| we did a study of Forthingill where we took a map of Forthingill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| and overlaid or of the zoning and we looked at all of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| Out of a hundred and some parcels that we looked at in this zone that we chose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4483)|
| 1:14:52| less than eight of them, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| maybe up to eight were actually conforming to the zoning that they were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| And so if you think about Forthingill as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| I mean, that is considered one of our more beautiful neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| but very few of those houses are actually conforming to the zoning that we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| And that goes in most of these areas that were highlighted in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| And so I really do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| I think that an RN3 that we have further out in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| away from downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| does not make sense to also be overlaid on a community like Forthingill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| or Old North or even Oakwood Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| And so I really would like to see action taken to make it more accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| for us to develop things like this in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| And I appreciate the efforts to go in and do this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| So again, my question, what can we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| apart from potentially spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| is there a broad stroke approach that we can take as a commission and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| staff that could make this attainable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4564)|
| 1:16:13| Yeah, we can chime in there and then defer to staff on other responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| But yeah, thanks for the background and thanks for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| You know, in the scan report that we provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| we give a lot of very specific recommendations on what to fix and how to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| it. But, you know, overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| there are a couple of things you could do. You could say, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| for the areas we're missing that'll make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| And we really want more of that in those areas that we showed on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| Or let's say a subset of those areas, you agree where it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| You map those areas and say the standards are going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| And here are the new zoning standards for those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| They're going to change over time to make more of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| Another way to get there is to go in and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| we don't want to change the base zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| but we can tweak a couple of the existing standards through some overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| that says in these areas, these standards override the existing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| So overlays aren't always the best fix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| but sometimes they're a better tool for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| The other, another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| and there are a lot of variations of this, but of what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| but the third option is to say, well, before we do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| let's do a pilot project and show what this really means today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| not a hundred years ago, but today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| And through that pilot project with a developer that you work with all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| and an architect that you can work with to help you do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| through that project, we will understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| we in Knoxville will understand how the standards need to change before we go change them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| And especially if it's hopefully a very good outcome, then people say, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| now we know why the standards seem to change in order to get that kind of outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| A lot of cities in the Northwest have done that pilot project approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| and it's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| So it could be an either or, but it's usually an and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| It's do the pilot project, explain and demonstrate why and how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| and then there's a basis for going in and tweaking the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| or replacing them in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| Yeah, just one more comment real quick on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| As a developer, my background is in development, and I agree 100 percent with everything you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| I'm looking forward to reading your report, actually, and the suggestions in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| My experience is the misconception and the misperception of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| even in the city and even furthermore into the counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| that we just receive so much pushback when people start talking about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| I mean, we need it. We really do need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| And with respect to Knoxville, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| and I wasn't privy to when everybody changed and did recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| and there was a lot of information and a lot of hard decisions that were made during that recode process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| But even with that, where the zoning is and compared to the sector plans and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| I think there's a bit of a disconnect, and we may have talked about some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| where RN2 is in low density, but RN3 in the city is considered high density, not medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4791)|
| 1:19:59| Or pardon me, it's considered medium. Is that right, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| On the RN3, it's considered medium density, not low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| So some of those things, I think, could be cleaned up if the will is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| because any kind of changes you're talking about would still have to go in front of city council to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4814)|
| 1:20:21| So, I mean, I hope there's a way that we can, as a body, encourage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| and show them through reports like this with some background that it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| Yeah, you know, I really appreciate your comments, because the density thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| it's one of those things where people are starting to, if you have the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4840)|
| 1:20:47| if somebody just says, well, I'm opposed to it, I don't care, there's nothing you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| But more people, when you show them, like when I showed you the two buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| and one was 30 in the acre and the other one was 29, they're completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| Five units versus 49 units, and they're almost the same density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| When you explain that to the average person, they say, oh, yeah, we're focusing on the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| You know, if you say 30 units is your max, well, then both of those buildings are possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4872)|
| 1:21:20| If you say 25 is the max, then you think you get rid of it, but you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| It's just a different form of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| So what we found is that kind of education is really necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| And, you know, some people still say, I don't care, I want to regulate by density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| Okay, in those cases, then we recommend if you're going to regulate by density, let's figure out what we all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4898)|
| 1:21:45| And then let's figure out what those densities are and put those in the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| And usually by that point, people say, oh, I see how the density number isn't really doing what I thought it was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| It's all these other things that are affecting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| So, yeah, you can never have too much education on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| Same with floor area ratio, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Thank you, gentlemen, for being with us today and taking time out of your schedule for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| and Amy for presenting this to the planning commission and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| And I'm sure the commission will look forward to having continued conversation with the city administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| as this hopefully moves forward with some positive recommended changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| So, again, thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| We have a few more cases to go through here, and we'll try to move through them fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| Speaking with Whitney Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| So as we move things around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4960)|
| 1:23:04| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| Number 3411C22UR, East Pedigo Road, west of Greenwell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4985)|
| 1:23:13| Staff is recommending approval for a dog grooming facility in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=4993)|
| 1:23:20| The agricultural zone allows for dog kennels for consideration for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| Since dog grooming is a similar use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| we've decided that it could also be considered for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5010)|
| 1:23:44| This is a picture of the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| The grooming facility will be west of the residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| and we can see here there's a couple of parking spaces, gravel parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| and there's plenty of room to turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| And the building will be approximately 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| This is a grooming facility, so dogs may be staying for several hours during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| but there will be no overnight boarding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| and they will remain inside the structure opposed to be running around outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5056)|
| 1:24:26| And the plan of operation is to only have around three to four dogs a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5066)|
| 1:24:35| One consideration is that this property has a private driveway that's shared with two other residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5075)|
| 1:24:52| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| If there's any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5093)|
| 1:25:01| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| Mr. Reynolds will be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| Save the best for last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| All right, so I'm going to go over the, real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| temporary use amendment to the Knox County Zoning Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| I presented this last month just as a primer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| County Commission asked that Planning Commission create recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| specifically for temporary occupations of a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| So basically if someone is building a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| they could live in a temporary arrangement like an RV or camper, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5139)|
| 1:25:47| So what we've recommended is two different components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| The first one is create a new section in Article 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| which is the general provisions of the county code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| That includes other types of general provisions like off-street parking and signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| that are applicable to all zones, so this is appropriate to include in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| And then we also created a temporary use permit process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| which is back in the administrative section of the zoning code, which is Article 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| So that's why there's, if you look in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| that's why we have two different pieces there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| Just real quick, so the temporary use permit just basically outlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| like I said, the administrative process, so that's how you obtain your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| But it also has some very basic standards that will apply to all temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| In particular, with regard to this use that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| it has a standard that the habitable structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| shall comply with all applicable building and fire codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| So we obviously want everybody to be in a safe living environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| even if it is a temporary one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| And then going into the next part, Article 3.100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| which is the new section that we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| You know, the intent is for this to accommodate more temporary uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| than just the first one that we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| so that's why it has some vague purpose, language, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| But it also has a, the last part of this is additional temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| It's really kind of a catch-all, because obviously we only start with one temporary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| but hopefully we'll add a few more as time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| But the intent there is that there's going to be more temporary uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| than what we have in our temporary use standard section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| and the building administrator has the authority to consider that temporary use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| and approve it based on standards that they feel are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| So that's the purpose of that Section 100.03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| That should be 3.100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| So the meat of what we're talking about is the temporary occupations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| of a recreational vehicle camp or other non-permanent habitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| One thing that I heard from last month is that the initial timeframe for a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5291)|
| 1:28:19| may have been a little short if we were talking six months to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| So what we recommended was to up that to one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| but work has to begin within six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| If they don't start within six months, they'll have to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| restart that process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| We're recommending that it be allowed in any zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| as long as it's a residence, as long as it's for a single-family residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5321)|
| 1:28:48| and the track is at least one acre in size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| and it's not in a platted subdivision like a typical subdivision that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| So we're talking about properties that are more rural in nature, most likely larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| There's really not a lot of difference between an ag lot, in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| and something zoned RA or even CA, for that matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| because CA does a lot of single-families as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| Mike, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| Do most campers and RVs, do they meet building codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| No, they do not meet building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| Doesn't it say there, this is habitable structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| shall comply with applicable building and fire codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| Am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| Applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Key word, applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Applicable, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| Again, so that's in the more generalized section of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| So those are built to a code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| I'm not sure what, I couldn't tell you what it is personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| And if we need to tweak that language, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| I think that was, the intent was just to make sure that whatever is being permitted for the residency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5393)|
| 1:30:01| for the residency is meeting a code that is recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| I mean, I would believe that RVs and campers have a code that they are built to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| I'm not sure if we need to broaden that or make it more general statement maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| Or maybe in this article 3.100 for temporary occupations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| we specify in that section that a more broad type of code that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| those are more applicable to those campers and RVs apply versus building code and fire code specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5432)|
| 1:30:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| If I were code's office, I'd be questioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| Because they're not going to be looking at the codes that RVs and campers are built from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| They're going to be looking at what was adopted by the municipality and is on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| I mean, it's not the Southern Standard Building Code or whatever that's used, but that's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5458)|
| 1:31:06| Steve, if you could respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| Steve, sorry, you have a comment there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| Yeah, I think our concern was maybe we can work with Mike to amend that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| We wanted to make sure that any type of camper or motor home they're living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| provided provisions for sleeping, cooking, and sanitation as required by the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| So maybe we do need to amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| When I read it, I do see the conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| So I'll work with Mike on getting that revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| All right, thanks, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| We can move on to the next item, number 27, Fairview Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5498)|
| 1:31:51| Okay, so I'm just going to give a brief overview of kind of the context around this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5511)|
| 1:31:59| and what the staff recommendation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| And if you have any more questions, feel free to ask, to clarify anything that is in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5521)|
| 1:32:10| And if you have any questions after the presentation, you can always reach out to me as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| if you have questions before the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| The request is for a 126-lot detached subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| The full property is about 93 acres with PR up to 2 dwellings per acre zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| And that zoning was established, I want to say it was like 2005 maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| So it's been a while since the zoning was established on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| This particular residential development is only on 33 acres of the total 93 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5561)|
| 1:32:48| So the gross density, which considers the entire property, is about 1.35 dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5568)|
| 1:32:56| The net density for the 33 acres is about 3.82, just to give you an idea of size of lots and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5576)|
| 1:33:04| So the way that the planned residential zone works is it does allow transfer of density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| from one portion of a property to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| So in this case, essentially transferring 60 units from the remaining 60 acres of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5591)|
| 1:33:20| Their proposed access is through the existing Beeler Farms subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| which is on the left-hand side of the screen there of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5605)|
| 1:33:33| I'm just going to jump directly to the staff recommendation and talk about some of the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| So we actually are recommending denial of this concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| because it is not harmonious with the existing development, as outlined below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| I do provide three points here, and then those three points are detailed out further in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| Basically, the Beeler Farms subdivision, which they want to access through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| was not intended to have their access extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| It was approved as a single cul-de-sac street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| The second part of it is a road stub out was not proposed by the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| or required by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| And the third is now that this subdivision is built out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| and the houses around the cul-de-sac are built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| the two most concerning to me in particular is that the last two houses in the cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| really weren't situated to accommodate or to address a future road extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5666)|
| 1:34:34| Basically, turned inward as if facing a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| instead of a more typical arrangement where it'd be arranged to face the outer street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5677)|
| 1:34:44| or the new street passing by the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5684)|
| 1:34:51| Again, so I'm just going to go to some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| So what you see in the hatching is the entire 93-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| Kind of the blue outline is where the proposed subdivision is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| and where you can see this little connection point is to where they want to connect to Beeler Farms Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| Beeler Farms subdivision has 53 units in it, had two separate approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| The first one was 2020 for 44 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| and it came back within a slight increase of acreage and another rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5718)|
| 1:35:25| and increased that to the 53 in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| Just to the south of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| there was also another development approved this summer for 83 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5732)|
| 1:35:41| It's a little closer look at the connection points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| So Beeler Farms Lane comes in, cul-de-sac, and you have the houses built out around that cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| There's two 25-foot strips that go out to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| One of those 25-foot strips is for the common area lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| The other 25-foot strip is to a residential house lot that is on the south side of that stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5758)|
| 1:36:05| So you can kind of see the lot lines in the image to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5765)|
| 1:36:14| This is existing conditions on Beeler Farms Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| These are the two houses on either side of the end of the cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| and you can see where the gravel is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| It's a temporary drive going back to the backside of the property where the common area is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| where they had to install some infrastructure and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| So that's where the road would extend through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| On the right is just a little bit further to the west in the subdivision, closer to the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5795)|
| 1:36:42| This gives you an idea of what the rest of the subdivision looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| It is all built out now, so there's no more houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| I'm pretty sure all the houses have been built at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| Mike, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| How did we get to this point where a developer already does a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| and staff is recommending no, and personally, I think rightly so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| but they've invested a lot of time and effort, money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| Did the staff meet with the developer or a surveyor prior to them designing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| or did they just throw it in front of you all and we want this approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| Yeah, I would say most of the concept plans that we get, a lot of the development plans we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| the applicants do not request to talk to the planning staff beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| It's the same as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| They did submit a concept plan initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| I can't remember which month it was, maybe August or September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| Initially, we turned it away because they did not have a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| They completed that traffic study and then resubmitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5870)|
| 1:38:00| Other than the design review during the application review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| we didn't have discussions about the project plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Can you go up to the green one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| Up one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| Up one right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| So that one that we approved over the summer, it's not built on yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Would there be an option if that one to connect to the new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| I mean, it could be they would have to negotiate with that developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| but they do have a cul-de-sac that ends somewhat close to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| Similar to this, the Beeler Farms, there's a blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| It doesn't show up on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| but you can kind of see a little blue area on the property above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| It actually extends down through these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| and connects into Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| So there is a blue line stream here, and same thing on the lower property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| So they would have to cross that, similar to the Beeler Farms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| to connect to that cul-de-sac, but they potentially could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5938)|
| 1:39:06| The larger subject property does have a connection over to Fairview Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5946)|
| 1:39:13| The applicant is not purchasing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| outside of the boundary that you're showing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| that I'm showing in the blue dashed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| I will say that, you know, crossing this tributary to Beaver Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| is a lot more substantial, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| than the other blue line stream that they're crossing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| So I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| I think it's always possible to cross them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| I would say that I'm sure there's a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| between crossing what they're proposing to cross right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| versus the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| The Beeler Farms subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| is it the same developer that did that portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| So how are they taking the common area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| The developer of Beeler Farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| still owns the house lot and the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6002)|
| 1:40:15| They referred to an HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| They never turned it over to an HOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| One of the things we would typically do is the code says if the cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| was going to be connected or extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| that there would be a proper sign there at the cul-de-sac end of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| or stub out saying that this road is intended to be connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| And obviously the original developer plus planning commission and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| approved a cul-de-sac at this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| So there was no intention at that four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| to have this road be extended as a connecting road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6050)|
| 1:40:58| So the developer of the other subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| is apparently either selling the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| or allowing them to use that property as an extension of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| Yeah, they're signed off saying that they were in agreement with the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6070)|
| 1:41:19| My understanding is that they're selling portions of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6079)|
| 1:41:27| And that's basically the only access, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Is that what I'm hearing too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| Well, the property now has access to Fairview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| They can still obtain access potentially through this cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| I wouldn't say it would be for what they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| Reasonable use of the property is all that's required for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| Unlimited use isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6116)|
| 1:42:09| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Thank you for your time, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| And for members of the audience, thank you for participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221108-agenda-review?start=6136)|
