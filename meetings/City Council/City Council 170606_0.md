| 0:05:42| Finally, I want to remind business owners and entrepreneurs about next week's annual business breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| This is a free meet-and-greet breakfast gathering on Wednesday, June 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=349)|
| 0:05:57| but really it's a great tool for business leaders and managers and particularly the owners of small locally-owned businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=357)|
| 0:06:05| to come out and find out about the $55 million in goods and services that we'll be purchasing over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| The breakfast is geared to help particularly local businesses become familiar with what types of contracts are going to be bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=372)|
| 0:06:20| and to develop strategies to successfully compete for those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| So if you know anybody in business who might be a supplier of the types of goods and services that the city will need over the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=383)|
| 0:06:33| please encourage them to come and find out how to compete for those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| I'm getting there. Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| So representatives from city departments will present information about specific projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| the anticipated date the work will be going out for bid, and the bidder qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| The business breakfast is from 7.30 to 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday, June 14 at the Civic Coliseum, which is 500 Howard Baker Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=411)|
| 0:07:02| If you want to register online, you can go to www.knoxvilletn.gov slash business breakfast, business breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=422)|
| 0:07:13| Not only is the breakfast free, but so is the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| It's available in parking garage C on Historic Preservation Drive, which is just right there across from the Knoxville Marriott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=436)|
| 0:07:25| one block south of Howard Baker Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| And now I'd like to call on Dan Kelly from MPC to talk about the new public notice signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=449)|
| 0:07:40| Mayor, Members of Council, this is the new public sign, or one example of the public notice signs that we're going to be putting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=460)|
| 0:07:51| that are replacing the black and white signs that you have seen for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| What is different now is the applicants will be posting these signs rather than MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| When an applicant comes in to make an application for a rezoning or a plan amendment, a street closure, whatever they be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| they will be given one of these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| The file number will go right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Of course, they have the contact information for us, and they will be required to post the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| They will sign before they leave there that they have received the sign, that they have been instructed as to when and where to put the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=501)|
| 0:08:30| and all that will be on their instruction sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| So if the sign doesn't get put out, that would be justification for the Planning Commission to postpone their item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=515)|
| 0:08:46| I will go ahead and say, though, if the sign gets put out the way they are right now, sometimes the sign gets put out and they do disappear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| the Planning Commission still can act on those matters, but they want to know that the sign got out as best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| We will spot check these. The staff will spot check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| Most of the people, of course, will now take pictures just so they can kind of cover themselves when they put the sign out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=546)|
| 0:09:18| I want to bring up the point that this is just one form of notice that we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| The public notice signs, the actual legal public notice appears in the newspaper, and the third is on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=565)|
| 0:09:35| All cases are posted to our website typically within at least 30 days prior to the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=575)|
| 0:09:44| and most of the actual community organizations now have the knowledge to go to the website and look at stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=584)|
| 0:09:54| because there's a whole lot of information, even 30 days out, that's on our website regarding each matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| So I brought these down. You can see they're color-coded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| That way when somebody calls in, they go, I saw an orange sign, I saw a blue sign, I saw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| At least we'll know typically what type of case it is in this particular case, a rezoning or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| It makes it a lot easier for us to be able to look in our records to see which particular item it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| and give them the information that they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| Dan, before you leave, you mentioned you were going to put the item number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| Will you also put the date of the hearing on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| At this present time, we're not thinking that we'll put the date on it because sometimes items get postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| and if they want to just leave the sign up, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| Again, without a date, if you start putting a date on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| then they're going to have to come back, get another sign replaced, do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| So at the present time, we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| So if they see the sign, they go to the website or call the number and find out when it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| And we started doing this last week, and what we have found so far is that people will immediately go and put their sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=659)|
| 0:11:09| It doesn't have to be up until about 15 days prior to the meeting, and these are for the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| So we're getting phone calls regarding July items already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| And the June meeting is the day after tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Harder to miss those colored ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Thank you, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=688)|

| 0:11:34| No reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=694)|

| 0:12:33| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Councilman Delivopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Yeah, Jim, if you can answer this, or perhaps Christy can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| but one of the items I was curious about, I don't remember us talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| was the money being spent on, I've got to find the page here now, the print is tiny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=764)|
| 0:12:52| but as you're coming up, Jim, the Sevier Avenue streetscapes is $7.9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=772)|
| 0:13:02| and I was just curious exactly what that is and why the number was so big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| and maybe you can just fill us in on what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| It's over several years, not all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| The Sevier Avenue streetscapes is a project, it's a continuation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| basically to do improvements to Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| The reason the number is so large is that's an 80-20 split, mostly fed money, fed state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| it may actually be an 80-10-10, but that's why the number is so large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| that's not all city funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| So if you have a big brother, the number gets bigger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Generally, that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| Okay, thank you, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| And that's stuff we did talk about through the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| that the next phase of South Waterfront was to, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| probably in the council budget hearing that you weren't able to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| but that's part of the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| I didn't see the video, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=847)|

| 0:23:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Joe Walsh, if you wouldn't mind visiting with us for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1388)|
| 0:23:18| The question is we have done this over a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| and I'm just wondering is the program continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| and when does people have to start thinking about applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| and all those kinds of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| This is the payout of prior approved projects submitted by groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| that have finally completed their effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| Is there something on the agenda for next year and what's the timing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Joe Walsh, Parks and Recreation Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Annually, and we've been doing this for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| We'll take applications starting in August and go on for about six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| and then we'll award these grant applications sometime in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| and then they have until the end of May to complete those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| so we can get this process completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| so we can expend the money out of the current fiscal year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| So they'll have probably, what, almost to the end of September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| to get their application in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| But don't wait, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| And we'll post that on the city's website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| as well as the Parks and Recreation Facebook page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| and we'll also try and publish that in the newspaper as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| so the groups that traditionally might want to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| know it's out there and can get their application in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| And by the way, the application is a fairly simple process, two pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| and it's not very elaborate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| but we encourage different kind of groups to be part of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| It's a great program because it helps neighborhoods get something accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| They can do their own fundraising and put in their sweat equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| but they get a little economic boost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| that helps them finish these projects that they undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| It's a 50-50 match program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| and we have the $16,000 reflects eight of these grants that are being awarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| that are being completed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| How many do you do a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| We do as many as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Sometimes it varies from 10 to 15 depending on how much money they request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| 12E is an ordinance approving an amendment to the South City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1506)|

| 0:25:20| ECG Martin Mill LP applicant first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Maybe Mr. Kelly is the one that can tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| but this is, what, 30 units an acre or up to 30 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| and there's about six acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Is that we're talking 180 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| What are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Thirty units per acre is the correct number of the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| I don't recall that right off the top, but 30 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| It says 6.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| So maybe 190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| But that's the ballpark, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| And the site has some challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| so the planned residential zone will work very well on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| And that will bring it back to MPC to look at the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| There will be a use-on-review required to approve their development plan, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| Will they be required to set aside some piece of the land for recreation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| There's already been discussions with regard to leaving a good portion of this property undisturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| because of the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| I just wanted to ask Arthur, and we talked about this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| but I think it's important that a developer plans to install sidewalks along Martin Mill Pike and Lippincott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1585)|
| 0:26:33| and ties in with existing sidewalks that are there and connecting all the way down to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| So, anyway, I'll give you all a chance to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| I'm going to ask John Shepherd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| We've discussed this issue today and with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Our intent, we will build those sidewalks along the entire lengths of Lippincott and Martin Mill on the perimeter of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| I think that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| It's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| We're talking about sidewalks and getting these things in on the front end of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| It shows your commitment to the community, and it shows our interest as a city to connect these sidewalks up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| So, thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Mr. Shepherd, could you give us your address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| 118 16th Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Yeah, I appreciate their willingness to meet with the Linwood Forest folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1644)|
| 0:27:34| They're closest to it, though it affects it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| You know, it's obviously in a very visible portion of South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| and I had calls, not necessarily of concern, but out of interest in what it was going to be once the old black sign went up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1661)|
| 0:27:50| and folks wanted to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| So, we did hold a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| It was very well attended, and I have not received any negative feedback at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| In fact, it's all been positive towards this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| So, lesson learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| It's always good to have those public meetings before we take it to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| but appreciate your willingness and Arthur's leadership in getting us all together in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| and making sure everybody was comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| So, look forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| All right, and I'll also add, after the public meeting, the neighborhood organization, of which I'm a member, met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| and they also voted to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1707)|

| 0:30:21| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| I guess I had a question for Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| Are hotels not permitted in C3, the C3 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| I guess I was a little confused on the need for rezoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| I think it has to do with the height limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| The height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| With the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| With the height limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| The 35 feet limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| And C4 has a higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Okay, so rather than a variance, they went for rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| Is that what MPC would have recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| Yes, it's the, given the other, you know, C5 is another zone that would accommodate a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1858)|
| 0:31:11| Given the mixed use of the area down there, the C4 is felt to be an appropriate zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Okay, council, we have two people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| Is Amosha Abdul-Ahad here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I do not see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| I do not see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Okay, so we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| Second is Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Sam, thank you for being here, and you know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| I'm going to state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Hi, I'm Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| My address is 301 Woodlawn Pike, Apartment J1, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1915)|
| 0:32:05| So first I just want to say thank you for what you do and the work that you do for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1925)|
| 0:32:13| I was looking at the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| I looked at the packet for tonight's meeting, and I, like, opened the PDF, and it was 470 pages or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| I was like, wow, that's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| It was, like, overwhelming to think about looking through because it had the capital improvement plan and all these things in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1944)|
| 0:32:33| So I know there is a lot of good stuff going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| You've all been serving our city for a long time and in so many different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| I'm obviously pretty new to this arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| But I do have some ideas I've been thinking about working on that I hope are maybe beneficial to the city of Knoxville, to the good of the city, if even in some small way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1965)|
| 0:33:02| So specifically I'd like to discuss purpose and mission, as in what's the purpose of civil service or what's the mission of civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1982)|
| 0:33:15| What's our mission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| We would agree, I think, that we want positive outcomes in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| Parks for people to enjoy, jobs for people to be employed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| Communities to be at peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| But how do we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| And that's not mission yet, but that is strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| We get there, we can steer where we want to go with a variety of strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| And we heard tonight about a lot of good strategies that are being implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| So I was just looking at the donation of money for kids registration fees at the STEM Academy at Vine Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| That's a good strategy, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Same with the money for the Innovation Valley Incorporated, based on the value that economic progress matters and is valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2043)|
| 0:34:14| And I know I'm preaching to the choir here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| This is where having a clear, holistic mission as a city is important, too, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2057)|
| 0:34:29| If we have a clearly defined mission, statement even, this is where we can develop better and more precise strategies based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2069)|
| 0:34:40| So I thought of a couple examples of what those might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| And these are just small ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| One might be helping citizens thrive and flourish in what they're gifted at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| and helping them love and care for their community, their neighbors, and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| Another might be restraining evil in the city and promoting the common good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| These kind of mission statements and the strategies and vision for what we want to do as a city then rest on values and beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2108)|
| 0:35:22| Some value examples might be we value ethics as a city, and I think that's pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| As I've looked through some of the planning things, ethics are always an important part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| Another value might be each person in the city of Knoxville matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| And these values are based on beliefs at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| And one belief that might tie into why each person is valuable, I think, is because God made people purposefully and uniquely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2144)|
| 0:35:56| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| So this kind of framework of thinking of what are our beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| Maybe we can come to some agreement on some beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| And then what are our values that are kind of based on what we believe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| And what's our mission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| And then what's our vision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| And what are the strategies that we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| And like I said, lots of really cool strategies that were discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2180)|
| 0:36:28| So this kind of structure has been helpful for me as I think through different decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| And I hope that maybe in some way it's been helpful to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| And I do think I enjoy hearing all of the good stuff you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2198)|
| 0:36:46| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Thank you for caring about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| Can we have the communication guys get out the information about that small business sort of city jobs breakfast that we're having on the 14th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2214)|
| 0:37:05| If they could get it to the BPAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| I don't know if they do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| But if someone will send me a PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| The business and professional organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Because they can then broadcast it to their members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| In fact, we've done radio spots, TV spots on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| But, yeah, it's been distributed to all the different business organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Well, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Through the chamber as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170606?start=2244)|
