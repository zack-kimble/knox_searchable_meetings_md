| 0:01:49| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| Okay, we have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| I have a litany of postponements here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| First off is 12A, which is dealing with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| And I would like to defer to the law director here for just a brief moment for discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| Well, we just wanted to explain that this Item 12A, certainly there's always room for debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| There's room for policy issues whenever you're talking about your PET ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| and all the regulations related to the care and maintaining of pets in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| There's always room for debate about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| But this was really not, when it was brought to you, it was not brought to you as a change in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| It was simply a clarification of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| And it was to clarify that really for decades, at least before 1993, and I think well before 1993,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=176)|
| 0:03:05| the rule within the city of Knoxville, whether you agree with it or don't agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| the rule in the city of Knoxville has very consistently been there's a maximum limit of dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| and or cats that you can have in a home, and that limit was four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| It's not something that the city goes out and actively enforces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| It only enforces it on a complaint basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| If there's some problem that comes up and a complaint is made, it's only on that basis that it gets enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| But that's what the rule has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| What happened reasonably recently was that this issue came before the city court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| and the question was raised as to whether it could be read to read that it's a maximum of four per person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=221)|
| 0:03:49| rather than four per home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| And it was, frankly, never intended to read per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| If you had six people in the house, four sixes or 24, 24 dogs could be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=236)|
| 0:04:03| So that issue arose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| And simply to do away with any possible ambiguity related to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| the law department was requested to make a change that made it very clear that the maximum cap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| being the same maximum cap that had been there in that ordinance for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| was a maximum of four per household rather than four per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| And that's what this particular ordinance was crafted to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| And nothing beyond that, which is not to say that there's not other things that you can talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| but that's what this one was crafted to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| Vice Mayor Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| Well, Nick, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Are you going to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Do you want to speak to that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| I was going to talk to 10A, but you hadn't gotten to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Well, then, thank you, Mr. Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| I do think the emails, the quite a few emails that we got, raised some great points outside of just this one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=292)|
| 0:05:02| So with that being said, I want to postpone it until January the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| I'm going to form the heavy lifting on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| and I'm going to form a task force that will look into this, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| the broader picture of the pet issue throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| So January 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| So that's a motion to postpone 12A, dealing with the pet ordinance, until January 21st of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=324)|
| 0:05:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| I guess I will add something, and that is that we all have gotten a lot of emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| and it goes beyond the point that our law director made pretty clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| that they're really trying to say is it the number of people in the house or what's a dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| and that's where the limit applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| And I think that's kind of a pretty easy clarification that maybe we can even make sooner than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| But the policy questions that have been raised are significant in terms of if you have limits that are artificial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=359)|
| 0:06:07| or artificially strict, do you make people feel like they're not law abiders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| or that they can disregard the law, and that's not a healthy thing in terms of civic pride and civic duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| And also the questions of whether we should be looking at what other cities do on spaying and neutering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| and trying to avoid the problem of too many pets and certainly having to put pets to sleep at Young Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| because they can't find enough homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| And those are all legitimate questions, and I commend you for assembling the task force to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| It's certainly worth a policy look, and it's certainly worth hearing from all the constituents on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| And thanks for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| And once we get into the work on it, if we want to break, you know, the two issues apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| then we always have that ability to bring that back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| And so perhaps that will come from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| I don't think anyone is writing about we want to fight over what's a household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| I don't think that was ever the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Anyway, that's my motion, and it has a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| As we create this task force, I would really like to encourage us to set a sunset date for this to come back to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=432)|
| 0:07:22| rather than go on for a very long time because once you investigate one aspect, then two more pop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| So I really think that the scope of the investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| and a time frame needs to be established when you create the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| Well, the time frame as it stands would be January the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| That's when I'm postponing it to, and I have every intention of meeting that deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| I just want to add to this that, you know, previous council gave us this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| If you all want to, you know, take that task force on and bring back other changes to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| we are perfectly fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| I know you'll work closely with the enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| With the police department in addition to all of the various interest groups in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| So we have a motion to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Did you want to speak to that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| No, I just had my what you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Anyone having postponements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Keep it on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| We have a motion and a second to postpone 12A until January 21st, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| And that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| I'd like to make a motion to postpone 12G, H, and I, which is the, for better or lack of terminology here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=517)|
| 0:08:47| the Dean Hill, Rufus Smith issue until September the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| So that's, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| So September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| This is to postpone 12G, H, and I until September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| And that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I would also like to make the motion to postpone 12V, which is dealing with the rezoning for the potential Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=555)|
| 0:09:27| I guess for lack of better terminology again, issue off of Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| There will be a workshop either the 22nd or the 29th of this month, and we'll confirm that tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=574)|
| 0:09:45| And I think, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Was that V as in Victor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| V as in Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| V as in Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| I think Mr. King, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| John King, Post Office Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=605)|
| 0:10:13| Mayor, Members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| We have, you haven't said exactly when you propose to postpone it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| September the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| And speaking to that motion, I would observe that my client has been very communicative with those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=631)|
| 0:10:42| and those entities who have asserted interest in the subject matter of this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=642)|
| 0:10:50| We have met with neighborhood groups multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| We have been open to those meetings and phone calls and trying to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| And we had hoped to go forward with a two-week postponement because of the absence of Councilman Greve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=662)|
| 0:11:11| and his interest in postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| What I would observe is that, as most of you know, when you're trying to develop a project, time is money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=676)|
| 0:11:25| And we're in a situation where we have to deal with the property acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| We have to deal with the contractors and the architects and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| all of whom have to work on a timeline looking to when this project is ready to start work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| And once you make a change in that timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| then that starts backing them up and into problems and issues about their own particular schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| So I had hoped and my client had hoped we could go forward and just postpone it two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| and have this up for consideration at your next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| I do not feel comfortable in insisting on doing so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=729)|
| 0:12:17| and saying under no circumstances would we agree to a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| I like to respect the wishes of council as much as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| but I'm pointing out to you that it is working a hardship on my client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| a hardship being cast in the category of expense as well as, as I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| an established timeline for trying to get things accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| I appreciate the interest of the persons who suggest a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=766)|
| 0:12:55| I would say that if we didn't have a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| we would be open to any meetings suggested by any particular member of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| We can't meet with you at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| and maybe you all don't even want to meet with us on an individual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| without notifying the press, the media, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| But we would certainly be willing to meet with as many as wanted to meet with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| in the interim period of time between now and two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| Like I say, I'm offering other potential alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| and I guess I'm whining a little bit on behalf of my client about the delay to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| more than a month from now, and then we've still got to go to that second reading thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=816)|
| 0:13:49| As I say, I've made my statement as far as the interest of my client and my interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=829)|
| 0:13:59| I'm not going to curl up and die if this postponement is granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| but my preference is certainly otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| We certainly wouldn't want you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Do we have a second on that to postpone 12V, the Tenova rezoning, Middlebrook Pike, to September 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=857)|
| 0:14:27| Are you speaking to that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| I was just going to ask one question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| In light of that request, is there any earlier date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| I know the workshop has to come before you to get the facts in order to sit down and make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| so it has to be more than two weeks because the workshop's headed towards the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| Is there any other date or is that pretty much the closing date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| I mean, I think council has decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| You know, we've pretty well polled twice, and I think the 17th is the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| And I hate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| I mean, I spoke with Mr. King and the folks from Tenova, and just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| I guess the comeback would be that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| an uninformed council could make a decision that wouldn't please them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| Some decisions don't help anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| This could certainly work to the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| If I understood, your suggestion was for the workshop to be either on the 22nd or the 29th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| And that will be determined tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| The ayes have it, and that is postponed to September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| I would like to make a motion to postpone 12WX and Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| That is the Bridgewater rezoning issue to August the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| 12WX and Y postponed to August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| Is there any discussion of a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| Lastly, I make a motion to postpone until September the 3rd items number 12AA, AB, and AC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=969)|
| 0:16:24| And that deals with the North Shore proposed development for the apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=984)|
| 0:16:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| We have a motion and a second to postpone 12AA, 12AB, and 12AC, dealing with the North Shore Town Center, to September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=998)|
| 0:16:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| I would like to make a motion to postpone 11U, the Chilhowee Park bandstand renovations, for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1015)|
| 0:17:03| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| It's the August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| We have a motion and a second to postpone 11U, dealing with the Chilhowee Park bandstand renovations, for two weeks, to August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| Councilman Dela Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| I wanted to have a motion to postpone Item 10A, if our colleagues will remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| We postponed it last time so that the parties could get a more detailed site plan for the entire site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1055)|
| 0:17:43| as opposed to the one unit of a duplex that was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| And that has just been completed either last night or today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| And so they're asking for a two-week postponement until, I guess that would be August the 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| in order for the developer and his engineer to sit down with the neighborhood group and actually carry out what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1079)|
| 0:18:08| There was a debate about whether we take two weeks or four weeks, and it looks like we've morphed into the four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| But the good news is they're going to work together to sit down and analyze that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| So I move that we postpone until the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| We have a motion and a second to postpone Item 10A, the appeal, to August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Any others for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| I believe that's a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| I think it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1118)|

| 0:18:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| The ayes have it, and those are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1137)|

| 0:19:08| This greenway will ultimately run from Spring Place Park to New Harvest Park, long-term planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| But for now we have a half a mile, about a half a mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| It's about a half a mile right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Half a mile made of crushed limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| And there are a lot of partners, the county, Parks and Rec, the Sheriff's Inmate Work Release Program, of course our public service crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1162)|

| 0:19:35| Neighborhood volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Neighborhood volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| And Councilman Della Vopi, who supported this prior to even becoming a councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| So we appreciate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| And, of course, Joe Walsh and Lori Gerlich with our Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| All of these and more were part of making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| So get out there and enjoy Loves Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| Tomorrow our former mayor, Governor Haslam, will be coming back home for an announcement on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| This is at 12 noon tomorrow, August 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1204)|

| 0:20:12| and announcing the formation of the Governor's Foundation for Health and Wellness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| And apparently health and wellness is becoming a top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| And I think that really fits in well with the opening of our Greenway and our Let's Move initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| and our outdoor Knoxville and urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| All those things that are going on right now all are about making a healthier Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| And the governor is doing the same statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| So if you want to join with the governor, it's tomorrow, August 7th at 12 noon on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| Also, we'll be having another ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1242)|

| 0:20:46| A lot of good things going on are opening up and projects being completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| Next Wednesday, August 14th at 11 a.m., we will be at the West Hills Pavilion at West Hills Tennis Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| The pavilion will provide shade and allow spectators to watch the tennis games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| Last year we opened the clubhouse, so this is a really great addition to West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| So that's next Wednesday, August 14th at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| And finally, next Tuesday, August 13th at 5.30 p.m., I'm holding one of our Neighborhood Connections events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| which is bringing several neighborhoods together in a region of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| This will be South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| It is at the Woodlawn Christian Church on Woodlawn Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| and we're inviting all South Knoxville neighbors and neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| folks who are interested to come and meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Department heads will be there, and we'll let you know what we're doing south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| and also be there to answer questions and receive requests and concerns from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1304)|

| 0:21:51| That's Tuesday, August 13th at 5.30 p.m. at Woodlawn Christian Church on Woodlawn Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Any council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Councilman Dallinopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| I just wanted to footnote your comments about the trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| I am so proud of our guys in the public service team that rolled up their sleeves and did that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| and it showed that, you know, there is a great use of in-house manpower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| These guys have very full schedules, but occasionally there are windows where they're in brush pickup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| or repaving, and if I understood Joe Walsh correctly, we spent more like $38,000 than $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| if we had contracted this out to someone who would bid on all the materials and the length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| and I think it's just a wonderful use of our crews, and I want to thank them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| and those guys, their spirit that they put into getting it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| Thank them for risking some poison ivy, they told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Some poison ivy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| That was one of the biggest risks was the poison ivy out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| I just wanted to make note of the passing of Sharon Smith Mosby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| who was a great singer here in the city of Knoxville and a Knoxville native,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| and express my condolences on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| Certainly she was an outstanding singer and brought joy to many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| so I just wanted to make note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| It was a wonderful concert whenever you got to hear Sharon Mosby sing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Any other reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| Okay, moving on to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| 8A is a resolution confirming the appointment of Lieutenant Edgar Earl Mitchell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| and Marva Martin to the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Item 9A is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 2013-2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Yes, I'd like to make a motion to amend 9A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| and I will go to Mr. Law Director here for the reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| First, we need a motion to approve, and then we do the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Motion to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Now we need the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| Then I'll make the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| And the motion to amend will be consistent with the revised version of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| that was distributed to you with your regular packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| and the changes that are made are really changes to the amount that's being changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| in the budget for general fund transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| It goes from $1,360,000 to $1,550,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Also the same with regard to the capital projects fund is increased by the amount to take it from $1,360,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1484)|
| 0:24:54| to $1,550,000 to be used for the Jackson Avenue acquisition project that you are all familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| So that would be the first amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| And then if that amendment is adopted, then there may be a second amendment coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| Second, because he had made the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| So the motion is to amend, as he just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| I just want to let everyone know I'll be abstaining for the same reasons I outlined last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| that my firm's involved in the underlying litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Councilman Del Voco, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Yeah, I was just wondering if Jim York or perhaps Mr. Swanson can explain just the broad brush general reason for the shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| just so that we understand how we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| I would think perhaps Mr. Wetzel might be best qualified to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| The 1.5 that you had before you tonight is what the actual cost to acquire the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| and to do the stabilization, that's estimated stabilization work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| We already had a little money in our Jackson Avenue fund that would stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| It would help us with any potential future other acquisitions along the corridor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| It would help us deal with legal bills that are coming out of this litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| There's quite a bit of that we still have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| So this funding would allow us to have a little breathing room to buy the property, get the property stabilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| make sure we got our legal bills covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| and give us a little negotiation room with another property down there on the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| that we may need to acquire to put a good package together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| And is that true for the other figure that Mr. Swanson mentioned that went from 1,026 to 1.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1594)|
| 0:26:43| Or is that the same number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| That's the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| We went to 1.3 last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| We had 190 in our Jackson account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| And so this is just 1.5 plus the 190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| We're going to save that 190 for those other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Contingencies that will come up that's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1615)|

| 0:27:00| Any other councilmen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| I mean, a vice mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| So this is a motion to amend to those new figures as just cited and discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1630)|

| 0:27:16| Vice Mayor Cavalas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| One extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| And with that passage, then I would like to also move that we hear this on an emergency basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| because obviously this is a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| We would have to go back to first reading if not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| So this would be the final reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| So I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| The ayes have it with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Now we're back to the original motion as amended two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| So we're voting on the ordinance with the change in amounts and with the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1675)|
| 0:28:07| We already had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| And that has passed 9A as amended with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Item 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 15, Article 2, Sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| 1551, 1557 relating to the nondiscrimination policy for hiring city of Knoxville employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1716)|

| 0:28:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Nourish Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| to create a food guide to connect growers, food producers, and food artisans with our community in an amount not to exceed $40,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Councilman Della Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| I wanted to ask the gentleman, Mr. Smith, to come up and just tell us this briefly sets up a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1739)|
| 0:29:09| where you're going to gather the data, build the database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| and help both individuals and businesses know where the food's coming from and that it's locally grown as opposed to something coming from overseas or somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Plan East Tennessee identified connecting local producers in the 11 county region to consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| And so this is putting together, the majority of this money will go putting together a food guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| This is one from Asheville area, if you've all ever been over there, that lists farms, grocery stores that use local produce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| restaurants that use local produce, and farmers markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| And that way, this is going to set up a mock one that we can then go out and show farmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| and all these other organizations what it is and get them onto this food guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| And it will be more brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| We plan to do this here on out for as long as we're around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| And this particular approval puts $40,200 in the pot to accomplish that initial assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| The question I asked you earlier is what commitment does that make in terms of the city to nourish Knoxville in terms of any future costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1806)|
| 0:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| The majority of the costs are for the set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| It won't take this amount of money every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| We will have ads and stuff that will sustain this food guide going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| If there's any grant money out there, we'd be, you know, happy to look at that also as a source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| But we're not, as you put it, it's not another mouth to feed for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| So hopefully it will be self-sustaining through ad revenue and any grant money we get from any organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| But the goal ultimately is to keep this up to date so that the information you get is still valid a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| We'll have to have someone to update the online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| It will be online and also connect with the farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| You know, farms come online and others that may not want their information in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| So it does require some ongoing costs, but we figure that will be covered from revenue and other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| This is just a set up to give us the prototype.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| I appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| I just thought some people might not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| No, no, thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| And Community Development Director Becky Wade, do you want to add something to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| I just wanted to add that this is a one-time contract for the food guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| This is with Plan E.T., Sustainable Communities Funds, that will run out the end of January 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| So this is a one-time contract for a deliverable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| And also, just to clarify, this is brought to City Council to approve because we are the recipient of the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| but it's actually a region-wide effort, region-wide leadership that has brought this recommendation to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| It's not just our administration that we're glad to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| but it's a region-wide initiative that is supported by all of the partners in the Plan E.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| Part of that $4 million, three-year grant that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| If anybody wants to take a look, I can leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Okay, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=1921)|

| 0:39:15| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I guess Chief Roush isn't here, but we have an assistant helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| This is a very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Chief Gass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| I'm putting my glasses back on, Chief Gass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| This is an important grant in that we have to do something to curb the violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| that I know has the entire community upset, as we see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| And I know it can't be done just by the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| It takes a lot of work and cooperation from all the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| and maybe you might spend a minute just speaking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| But, I mean, we all want a safe, healthy city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| And between these grants and between working with neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| and maybe programs that different departments provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| even our rec programs and from Joe Walsh's group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| this is a way of attacking something that we really need to control in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| to keep it healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| So give us a nickel's worth about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| It's a great opportunity for the city to get this money to help us put forth some efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| to get out in the community, meet with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| agencies within the community to help address this, develop strategies to develop some programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| which will address youth and their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| and how we can kind of get them on the front end before they get into the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| that we've started seeing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| But we hope to be able to take that money that we're getting, use it as seed money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| and provide resources for the agencies to reach out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| Thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Yes, Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| I want to also speak to that because, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| it's an issue that's plaguing a good portion of my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| And we did have a panel just a few weeks ago trying to deal with that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2462)|
| 0:41:12| So I'm glad to see this occur and hope that we'll be able to solve some of the gun violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| and gang violence that's going on in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment to agreement C-13-158| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| with Cannon & Cannon Inc. for additional professional engineering services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| associated with the Sutree Landing Park project in an amount not to exceed $14,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Councilman Nalewski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Since we've got Bob Wetzel here, I've just got to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| why do we have Lincoln Landing on the shore of the Tennessee River?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| Can't we get Admiral Farragut or something landing over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| where we get a Tennessee boy and an Knoxville boy recognized for his service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| All things are possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| We're working with the name that was given us when we started with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| We all have a street name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Kind of an inlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Renaming committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| We have a street name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| There's more to that issue, but that's enough for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| That's a relatively small amount, I guess, based on what I was reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| I just was wondering what exactly did we miss something with the $14,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| Really, why wasn't that noticed on the front end on a pretty big contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| Yeah, I'll try to give you a short answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| and if we need to get more detailed, Don Michelle is here to talk some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| Basically, when we went into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| there was one boathouse that had been designed in the previous structure back in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| that had the footings and the pylons out into the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| That looked like it was going to, as we did our constructability review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| that was moving towards a million-dollar boathouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| We got some ideas from our architects on how we might take that million-dollar boathouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| back to a $500,000 boathouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| and so we decided it was worth spending the $14,000 to make that change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| to get them to work in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Do you think that's going to be a boathouse that the city is going to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| How do you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Well, it's called Lincoln Landing, and it's several features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Don, you might want to come up and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| There'll be a picnic pavilion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| There'll be a place to store kayaks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| There'll be a place to put boats into the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| There will be a small restroom facility, things along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| You did it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Don's worked hard on this all day, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| I think questions were answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Thank you for your work, Don, Michelle, and Bob on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2631)|

| 0:44:37| We'll let Don, Michelle, come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2677)|

| 0:44:51| and how they're going to mesh together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Good evening, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Don, Michelle Foster, Deputy Director of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| As you know, back in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| MPC did a Magnolia Avenue corridor plan study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| which was approved by Council also in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| What we're requesting is for a contract to move into schematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| and conceptual design for those plans on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| We know Magnolia Avenue is a great corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| We know it's a great street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| We just want to make it a great complete street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| by adding some pedestrian amenities to it, intersection improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| streetscape improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| and also bring some vitality and enhancement that can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| in economic development along the corridor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| Supporting the Mayor's initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| moving from disinvestment to investment from the downtown out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| Magnolia is a great east-west connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| It's also a state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| and so we'll serve that purpose to enhance that corridor greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Yes, I wanted to ask you over in that there's a task force that will be assembled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| That's part of the scope of services that our consultant has actually in their contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| and we will have public meetings as well as a stakeholder group as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| Well, I was reading the information about the neighborhood group that will be represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| and it's about at least three neighborhood groups that border Magnolia Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| so I hope that all three of those neighborhood groups, Park Ridge, Cold Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| Hill Highway, they'll all be invited and be a part of that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2790)|

| 0:46:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2799)|

| 0:46:47| and also the East Knox Business and Professional Organization has taken a real interest in life along Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| and the business development, and I think it would be great to involve all those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| when we have these consultants in town on those two scheduled public meetings to get their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| and to get their sort of buy-in to what we're doing because this is a great step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| We know that Magnolia Avenue serves a purpose for most of those business owners along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| Bob and I both attend those meetings monthly, and we also have them listed as a stakeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2833)|

| 0:47:58| of $180,247 and to execute a contract consistent with the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2884)|

| 0:48:06| Councilman Delamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| I don't know if Gary's here or Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Someone's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Gary is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| I hate to make you walk all the way up here, but Gary, the way I read this, we found a way to save money by piggybacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| with the county in terms of this type of insurance, and if you'd just take a second and tell us about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| because this is obviously another example of managing the business so that we spend less dollars to get what we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| and I'll give you a chance to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Gary East is the city's risk manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Several years ago, actually, we went to the county and asked them if we could piggyback on their property insurance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| because with all the schools and buildings they have covered, they have a property schedule that's about three times our size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2926)|
| 0:48:55| and they're able to get a rate much lower than we could get on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| So we're going to get a volume discount, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| Very much a volume discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| So it does save us, I'd say, $20,000 to $30,000 at the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| You get an attaboy for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=2951)|

| 0:55:52| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| I just had a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| I noticed that this was next to planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| Is there any reason why the staff felt C-4 was better than planned commercial, or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| would be the advantages and disadvantages of each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| The staff has a long tradition of recommending planned commercial in these instances, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| there is a long history of those recommendations not being carried forward by either the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| commission or the legislative body, so we've kind of given up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| Well, there's an honest answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Yeah, but I want to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| This was for automotive sales and repair, so I assume that it has some external use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| of the property in terms of putting cars and that type of stuff on the lot as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| inside a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Is that why you have C-4 as the staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| The dominant zoning in that area is a combination of C-3 and C-4, and the big difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| the two districts is the outdoor storage treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| In C-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| So C-4 is broader with respect to the uses that can be done on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| But I take it in the midst of all that explanation, automotive and automotive repair tends to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| be more on the C-4 side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Is that fair or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| That's an appropriate zone for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| It's not just compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3447)|

| 0:59:09| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Since Mark is here, I wanted to just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| It almost looked as I was reading through this, a little bleary-eyed with the 1,100 pages we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| that the reason for the zoning change is to allow them to have some type of new signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| Am I reading that right, or is that just incidental to the whole process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| It would be speculation on my part, but, yeah, that may be the driving factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| There are significant differences between the regulations related to signs between R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3579)|
| 0:59:46| and any of the commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| And this is in a location, obviously, on Merchant Drive where there is a lot of commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| Are your questions answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| Oh, I didn't know we had someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| Would you like to state your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| Dale Maddox, administrator at Wallace Memorial Baptist Church, 7060 Whistling Winds Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| We had a sign several years ago that was destroyed, and we have made do with a temporary sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| We'd like to put the name on the side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| And per NBC, this was the best way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| The best solution was to add that commercial label so that you could have the sign in the locations you needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| Yes, on the side of our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| So this is not a separate proposal coming on aside from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| Are you really focusing on this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| It's our existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| That's the only reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Very big, nice church along Merchant Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Tell us more about that sign and where you're going to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| I mean, you've built out the side, or it looks to be pretty dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| So anyway, tell us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| We would like to put the name on the side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| And to do that, we had to go from R2, which was the original designation of the property when we acquired it 60 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3666)|
| 1:01:18| I don't know how we got our first sign, but it was destroyed, and we've lived without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| It's time to put our name on the building, and this is a process we're going through, and that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| So no pole sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| At some point we might like to put a monument sign, but right now we just want to put our name on the side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3693)|
| 1:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Even you sign guys ought to like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| So is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3714)|

| 1:01:58| I vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| The motion passes with one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3720)|
| 1:02:08| 12T is an ordinance approving the request of Wallace Memorial Baptist Church for an amendment to the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3728)|

| 1:02:19| northeast side, Scenic Wood Road, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| Do you have your line on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| I'll just leave it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| I'll say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| I mean, this is, I mean, they've got, they're right up against Merchant's Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| and this is the very issue that we're trying to deal with in the signed ordinance that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| we've been working on for 18 months is to limit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| I mean, they're not adding on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| I mean, this is strictly for more signage on Merchant's Road, and you've been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| and they're pretty visible with their large steeple, and it's way high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| I mean, to me, it just seems excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| And for them to be able to put another pole sign up there in the future or something, it's just, to me, it's excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| Wouldn't you have to permit that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Wouldn't you have to seek a permit for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| You'd have the zoning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| You'd have the zoning that would allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| You'd have the zoning that would allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| So if you've been out there, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| You know it's a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| The question is what's the name of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| It's plenty visible, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| But that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Well, I mean, I'm certainly taking them on their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| I know that's a little dangerous sometimes in this situation, but, I mean, if I'm not correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| you want to have your name on the building and possibly a monument sign in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| but you're not proposing any kind of pole sign, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| That is very correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| We don't even have a design for a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| We just understood this was the first step to even allow us to put our name on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=3829)|

| 1:06:46| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| I think you did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| Okay, all the rest are consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| We do have someone who signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| Is Rocky Swingle still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Mr. Swingle, please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| And by council rules, I'll set the timer, and you have up to five minutes, and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Rocky Swingle, 7213 Sheffield Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| I want to comment on the Sonova issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| First, thank you, council, for scheduling the workshop for the 22nd or 29th, whichever one it happens to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4035)|
| 1:07:25| We really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| It's a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| It deserves a full discussion and, you know, hearing out everything, and we appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| And secondly, thank you again for postponing the first reading of the rezoning ordinance until September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4055)|
| 1:07:44| You know, we may, we probably won't know the situation with Sonova by then, the ownership, the direction, the strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| the business plan, but maybe we'll know a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| And I think it's dangerous to rezone without the dust settling a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4075)|
| 1:08:03| You know, you kind of open the door for unintended consequences if you rezone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| and then all of a sudden Sonova takes a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| So thank you for that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| I also want to mention, in case you didn't know, you probably do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| but last night there was a meeting of the Wesley Neighbors Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| which represents houses on the eastern side of West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| And one of the, well, really the item on the agenda was a vote on whether people wanted the hospital to be built on Middlebrook or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4108)|
| 1:08:38| The vote was no, 91, yes, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| We also have throughout West Hills now a couple of hundred yard signs with more actually arrived today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4124)|
| 1:08:53| We ran out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Our petition has 300 plus names on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| And if you recall, I'll mention again the July 8th meeting when about a hundred residents showed up at the West Hills Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| where Sonova was presenting and pretty much told them we didn't want their hospital there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| So if there's any doubt in your mind about how the community feels, these facts should clear things up, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4151)|
| 1:09:22| The other issue is, you know, this is potentially a huge project for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4162)|
| 1:09:30| You know, we're talking about a $300 million investment by Sonova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| and there are taxes associated with that and there are temporary jobs associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| I don't think there are permanent jobs because I think the people in North Knoxville are just going to move west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| or they're not going to work in West Knoxville and somebody else who works in Knoxville will fill those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| So I don't think you're going to see a net gain in permanent jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| But there will be taxes, you know, and some temporary jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| But the point I want to make is those taxes and those temporary jobs are not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4199)|
| 1:10:07| We, the residents, pay the price for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| The biggest price, arguably, is the closing of St. Mary's as a full-service hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| If Sonova builds, that hospital goes away as a full-service hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| That's the price to North Knoxville and surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| That's the biggest price, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| The other big price, which you've heard about, is the diminution of quality of life for people in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4231)|
| 1:10:39| particularly West Hills, Ridge Rock Road, which technically is West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| even the houses across Middlebrook Pike, the condos and the apartments adjacent to the Dowell Springs business area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4244)|
| 1:10:55| The biggest complaint is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| The second biggest is the intrusive nature of this big development on a community that doesn't have anything like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4258)|
| 1:11:07| and doesn't want anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| And the third biggest, and by biggest I mean what you hear mostly from residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| the third biggest is an environmental issue, particularly flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| There's a creek that runs across the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| It originates in West Hills in the northeastern part of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| and over the years they've had flooding problems and still do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| and people there are very fearful that this is going to increase those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| Also people are concerned with loss of open space, with wildlife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| because this whole area is surrounded by development and there's no place for them to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| Sir, you have 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| We were told last night that the city was not going to do a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| and I urge you to change that and do a thorough traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| So NOVA's going to do a study of the main arteries as required by law, we were told, Middlebrook and Weisgarber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| We need to look at West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| We need to look where West Hills roads enter into Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| We need to look at Old Weisgarber, the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| And I really think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| This is a huge issue, and I really think it's important for council to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| if it's your job or somebody's to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| And the other one is an environmental study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| Council should fund that as well, particularly looking at the flooding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| And finally, I know I'm running out of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| but I invite you again to come walk the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| If you had some interest in that, you'll be amazed to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| We'll be happy to, you know, show you around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| I would ask Mark Donaldson to clarify about the traffic study, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| It's not that the city won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Explain how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| The proposed zoning is 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| and a hospital is listed in the 01 zone district as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| As part of the submittal for a use on review for a hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| the applicant will be required to submit a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| and we have determined that it will probably be the most intense traffic study that we outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| in our administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| As part of that application, it will be reviewed by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| and reviewed by the planning commission and become a part of the public packet of material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4409)|
| 1:13:36| So we do require a study, and a study will be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| and as intense of a study as MPC requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| and we've actually stated that we want an intensive study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| So that does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| It's not just that the burden is on Tenova to do it, but it's to our standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| My request is to do it before you vote on the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| because that's probably the most important factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| or certainly in the top two or three that you should consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| you, council, should consider, you know, before you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| That was my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| I'd like to say that Mr. King, after we postponed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| that his client would have to be there on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| So the workshop will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Well, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| Oh, that's a convenient date for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Well, we need them there, so obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| Yeah, we have to have them there, so the council knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| I just wanted to tell Mr. Rocky Swindle that it would be prudent for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| or someone from your group to be at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| I'm sure they'll be there, won't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Don't assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Don't assume that because you've said it here that our memories will carry forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| or that one of our colleagues who isn't here today had a family wedding to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| but it's important that you make that record so that all the facts can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| So are you saying it's set for the 29th, or are we still waiting to hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| Well, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Without a testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Yeah, without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| I mean, that's the whole purpose is for us to see, you know, their plan and hear from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4507)|
| 1:15:15| So, I mean, I don't want to have two workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| I'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| I mean, obviously, I want to tell people that it's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| so I want to tell them the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Is that official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| I mean, we voted on it earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| It was the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| I know we discussed it at our pre-meeting dinner this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| but if Mr. King says that's when his client can be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| then I think that that's the date that it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| Unless, you know, we can discuss that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| But if that's when his client can be here, I don't know what else to do but that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| Why don't you leave an e-mail address or a contact with Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| She'll let you know if there's any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Is there anything else, counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130806?start=4553)|
