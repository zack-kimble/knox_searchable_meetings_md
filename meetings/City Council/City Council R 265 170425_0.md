| 0:02:34| So we are not going to apply for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| Well, it's being funded through another program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| Okay. Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| So there's a motion to withdraw. Do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| No. What it is is the state has decided that they would put us in a different grant to fund the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=167)|
| 0:02:56| Wonderful. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=176)|

| 0:03:30| For the Mayor's report, first I want to remind everyone that we have the State of the City address this Friday, April 28th at noon at Sutry Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=210)|
| 0:03:41| You can still RSVP by calling 311 during normal business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| That way you can come anyway, but we may not have a lunch for you, a bag lunch for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| So please RSVP if you want to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| Also, if you're coming, we need you to park in the garage on Blunt Avenue across from the former Baptist Hospital site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| We'll have shuttles that we run back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| There's very limited, very, very limited parking at Sutry Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| So we ask you to come early, park, ride the shuttle, and then enjoy the park before we start at 12 noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=247)|
| 0:04:15| I'm looking forward to sharing my proposed budget for 2017 and 18 with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| We have a lot of great things that are going on in our city, and we'll be talking about ways how we build on that momentum and keep it going the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=261)|
| 0:04:30| Just a reminder on the timeline for the budget after this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| It will be on the agenda for first reading at the next council meeting on May 9th, followed by council's budget hearings on May 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=275)|
| 0:04:44| And then it will be up for final adoption at the May 23rd council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| I also want to invite everyone to join me and members of the Lonsdale Homes community tomorrow, Wednesday, April 26th, at 4.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=291)|
| 0:05:00| for the opening of the new Xavion Dobson Memorial Playground and Park at 2701 Badgett Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| As you all know, we had an exciting announcement last week about an Emerald Jeep proposal for a sports complex right across the street from Lonsdale Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=307)|
| 0:05:18| It's different. This playground is different. It's for the little kids, and it's right in the heart of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| But it is aiming to create another safe place for the young folks in Lonsdale Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| It really came directly out of conversations with parents and neighbors led by Zenobia Dobson, Xavion's mom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| who has been a really great champion for children in Lonsdale and across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| Gerdau, a local company, and KCDC donated land, funding, and in-kind services towards the park's construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| The city donated funding and in-kind services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| The project was also supported by significant donations from Pilot Flying J and Recreational Concepts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| together with donations from businesses and residents across Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| So if you can, come join us tomorrow at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| We also have another ribbon-cutting coming up next Wednesday, May 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| At 11 a.m. that day, we'll be celebrating the completion of the beautiful new entrance to Fort Dickerson Park on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| directly opposite Woodlawn Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| This project was made possible by the Aslan Foundation, which invested $1.65 million to purchase property and to cover design and construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=384)|
| 0:06:36| If you haven't seen it, the Fort Dickerson Gateway has really transformed the entrance there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| with a two-story stone veneer wall, 15-foot stone pillars that frame the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| a grassy lawn surrounded by a circular stone bench wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| and a covered CAT bus stop and accessible sidewalks leading into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| This completes the $1.4 million Fort Dickerson Road realignment project, which we completed last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| which gave the Chapman Highway entrance a much-needed traffic light and made it a lot safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| with crosswalks, accessible sidewalk upgrades, and an improved entry road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| Again, that ribbon-cutting is Wednesday, May 3rd, at 11 a.m., so please join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| I do want to say that the Knoxville Police Department and all of us have really lost a great friend this week with the passing of former Deputy Chief Rudy Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=441)|
| 0:07:30| He served KPD for 35 years, and I know a lot of KPD veterans remember him very fondly, as well as people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=450)|
| 0:07:39| Even after he retired in 1997, he returned as an advisor to help KPD through a difficult time when there was a lot of community anger and distrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=459)|
| 0:07:49| And Chief Bradley's mediation skills, the relationships he had built in the community, were essential through all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=469)|
| 0:07:59| We have sent our condolences and thoughts to Chief Bradley's family and Chief Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| I know you have as well, and I believe you were there at the receiving of friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| Our city owes Rudy a great debt of gratitude for his many years of service and leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| so please remember his family in your thoughts and prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| So I assume most of you saw the newspaper this morning, but I want to commend Chief Sharp for his department's actions Sunday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=500)|
| 0:08:29| in responding to a fire in an apartment complex on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| Our firefighters rescued several people from the burning building, bringing them down the ladders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| and Senior Firefighter Eric Beau Merritt safely caught, actually caught, a one-month-old baby when the baby's father dropped him from 30 feet up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=518)|
| 0:08:49| You have to know you're really, you know, concerned about your baby if you would willingly drop that baby into the arms of anybody, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=529)|
| 0:09:04| We really want to send a big thanks and a debt of gratitude to our Senior Firefighter Merritt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| and to all of the folks who were there and got those people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| And I know you all do this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| You don't really train, as he said, to catch a baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| I don't want to add that to our training regimen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| But they just never know what both police, fire, emergency responders, you never know what you're going to come across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| So we thank you all for what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Any council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=577)|

| 0:09:50| We want to thank her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=590)|

| 0:13:30| So before we, we have two appeals now, and before we start on the first one, I do want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| to mention that for the second one, for 10B, the appeal by Mr. Zimmerman, there are four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| people who have signed up to speak for the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| Typically, council rules are that up to three people can speak, so you may want to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| among yourselves and decide who those three will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| I just want to give you that advance notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=837)|
| 0:14:06| Is there a Margie Marsh here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| I think the people who have signed up to speak are Margie Marsh, Barbara Cook, Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=850)|
| 0:14:19| Field, and Joshua Johnston, who are four of you, if you maybe want to step to the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| and discuss among yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Okay, so we'll move on with 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Christopher Salmons of the Board of Zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=873)|

| 0:14:50| Glasgow, Nana's House, Applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Okay, so with an appeal, we have the appellant speaks first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| That would be Mr. Salmons, and he, and if he has anybody with him, can speak up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| minutes each, and then the respondents will speak, and I think I've got one person signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| up for that, Shelley, Glasgow, and then the appellant gets up to two minutes for a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| So you're Mr. Salmons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| All right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Let's go ahead and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| I keep the time, and I'll let you know when you're about a minute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| My name is Christopher Salmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I reside at 1710 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| I've come to the Board this evening asking you to uphold the City Council rules and overturn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| a decision made by the Board of Zoning Appeals in regards to the zoning of the daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| It does not meet the requirements to successfully file for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| City Code outlines that there must be hardship proved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| No hardship was displayed at the Board of Zoning Appeals, and I'm asking the Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| to overturn that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| And that's the only, nobody else has come to speak with you, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| So now the respondent, Ms. Glasgow, did I pronounce that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=970)|
| 0:16:21| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Okay, Shelley, Glasgow, and the address is 1711 East Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| I'm the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| We're just a small daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| You know, we basically went through everything we need to do with the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| to open a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| It was a daycare prior to us moving there in 2010, and I've tried to talk to him about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1001)|
| 0:16:50| you know, is there something we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Is there something that, you know, we're doing that we can easily fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| And I've got nothing, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| We'll see if Council has questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Now, do you, you can have, are you finished, ma'am, or did you have more to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| No, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Okay, we'll see if Council has questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| So, Mr. Sammons, did you have up to two minutes for a rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| The zoning makes specific the amount of spaces required for a building for childcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| It lays out the amount of space required for a childcare area, a playground in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| The playground is required to be 35 feet from a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| It also goes on to say that you have to prove hardship and you must maintain in the spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| In certain cases, the applicant is asking for the code to be removed completely, zero parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1059)|
| 0:17:47| They want their playground to be immediately next to a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| They want the facility requirements of the building to be reduced by almost half, the playground size to be reduced by 78%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| There's been a long issue with other neighbors in this business in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| We've had several complaints with 311 with diapers and garbage being in the public alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| Overall, they're not good neighbors, but they don't live with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| It's not an issue of a new code and a business simply needing to be grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| This is a building and a structure that conforms to all of the others and simply the business doesn't conform to the city codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| They're just skirting the city codes in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| We're just asking the city to uphold the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| OK, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| So council's now time for council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Yes, I think that this business has been there a while and has not caused any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| And I would like to make a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| OK, there is a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| Councilman Dellamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| I wanted to ask a question or two to Mr. Simons, if you would come forward to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| In reading this record, I was a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| There seemed to be some back and forth as to whether or not your real objection was that some gate between that property and the epilepsy center or the next door neighbor was allowing more traffic in or bothersome traffic in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1145)|
| 0:19:21| And you had complained about some rubbish being disposed of in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| Could you describe that problem and how that relates to this whole issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| In other words, is that the trigger that kind of got you riled up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| There's been several issues, including the garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| The garbage on more than one occasion, whether it's diapers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| At one point, there were office partitions that were put in the alleyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| There are a number of homeowners, including myself, that used the alleyway for the garage or used to our own personal driveways, and they had obstructed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1183)|
| 0:19:51| The play place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| So it's their rubbish that was obstructing the alleyway, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Is that continued or is that cleared up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| It's something that's been a concern over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| And that was something that was discussed with Mr. Brace when I filed my complaint with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| But the traffic is just one portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| There is a driveway that runs between the structure and the epilepsy center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| They've opened the back gate and they're using it as a driveway, a drop off point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| So we have seen increased traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| But also the play place is immediately next to the alley and all that separates the public alley and the play area is a chain link fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1220)|
| 0:20:28| There's a concern that the children have stuck their arms through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| What if something happens to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| There's a lot of concerns with those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| We were not aware that there was no zoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| So basically what triggered it was a neighbor had suggested that perhaps if there had been a variance issued for the structure that it came with terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1241)|
| 0:20:51| So we looked it up, and lo and behold, there were no appeals or no zoning variances granted by the MPC as is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1251)|
| 0:20:59| Okay, but the facility has been there since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| And I gather there hasn't been an issue with a lot of children being injured through the fence or near the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| And it seems something more concrete than that got you concerned about this place being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| I mean, it's been there a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| I respect the concern, sir, but respectfully, you can operate a business illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| It doesn't make you exempt from the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| All the other daycares on the east side of town conform without any variances required for all the city codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| I guess I don't understand that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| As a restaurant manager, we are required to conform to city codes, and I've seen it in personal cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| Right, and you said as a manager that you're concerned about safety of patrons in a restaurant and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| Right, and if you don't conform, then you are shut down until you do conform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| All right, well, I did read in that same record that the state of Tennessee periodically inspects this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| and other daycares and did not have an issue for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| That doesn't answer your question about does that meet the hardship standard or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| but it seemed like there was some external review to the safety that occurs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| There are standards set forth by the state health department, so the state of Tennessee has reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| However, it doesn't negate it from the city's codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| They don't review it based on the basis set forth by the city and the coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| So they're two completely separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| When the state goes in to review a childcare facility, they're only looking for a certain number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| What about the offer that they would keep the gate closed and not use that as the drop-off point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| Does that solve some of your problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| No, sir, there are still other issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Another problem that was brought with Mr. Brace is that they continually try to skirt codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| They didn't have a valid business permit from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| There still remains a violent registered sex offender living in the apartment structure immediately next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| and none of these problems have been remedied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Ms. Laskow, could you tell me what, from your perspective, is triggering the dispute with your neighbor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1376)|
| 0:23:07| There's that issue as opposed to the issue of what's the rule for a variance, but I want to separate those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| Tell me, how did we get in this mess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| It all started when we opened the back gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| We share a driveway with the Epilepsy Foundation, and sometimes, like when it's raining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| our parents pull up and park and run their kids in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| Like a drop-off in the morning kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Yeah, and so in order to not have the Epilepsy Foundation employees waiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| there's like a slide gate that is on the alley, and we open it up when the trash comes and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| Well, we decided during the morning time to open that gate up, and then that way there's nobody waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| You can come in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| Waiting in the alley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| Well, waiting to turn into the daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| The Epilepsy Center only has maybe four employees or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| but we didn't want to inconvenience them if our parents are blocking the way for them to pull in and park in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1443)|
| 0:24:12| And so when we opened up the gate, well, then we got the complaint from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| So, okay, now we've closed the gate, and we've just told the parents, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| I'm sorry if it's raining, just pull all the way in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| We do have four of our own spots, but the Epilepsy Center said we could have their three spots on the end as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| So we've told the parents, you know, you're more than welcome to either park in the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| or you can pull in the back and use our parking spots or the last three of the Epilepsy Center's spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| But none of this was even an issue until we opened the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| And then the Epilepsy Center said when they moved in that he had an issue with them opening the gate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| So since then I've shut the gate, bungeed it, and I only open it for trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| How long have you been running this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Well, how long has it been a daycare center prior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| It was Lady Ladd before that, so I don't know how long she was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| Mr. Frost, what are the criteria that we're supposed to be using here tonight to look at this appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| Well, it's the variances section two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| I would like to point out the appellant mentioned the location of someone allegedly a sex offender next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| I don't think that's on the applicant's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| That's not part of the criteria whether or not a variance is granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| The purpose of a variance is to modify the strict application of specific requirements of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots or other exceptional physical conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| whereby the strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| which would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| I mean, everyone on council is very familiar with that type of thing, those standards that are in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| That's what council needs to do in looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| You're hearing this in an administrative posture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| You need to have obviously listened to the two speakers tonight and reviewed the record at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| and your determination if at this location the appellant has pointed out the grounds for denial of the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1585)|
| 0:26:35| which was variances, plural, which were granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Is Mr. Brace here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| I don't know if we can call on him or whether that's not our prerogative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| but if he was here, there was some mention of outstanding violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| If he could tell me if he knows about this particular property, he may not be prepared to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| Are we having codes issues at this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| David Brace, City Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| I've forgotten his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| The gentleman did come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Mr. Sammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Yeah, Mr. Sammons was concerned with the enforcement of the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| and so he did come in and meet with myself and Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| and Mr. Ahrens outlined the procedures we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| The zoning code is very different than our sanitation codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| It's regulated differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| It's not like a dirty lot or an inoperable vehicle where we can tag it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| It's what's permitted or not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Yeah, it's very different, and it goes through the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| So he did come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| I don't have all those records in front of me, but he did have concerns about equitable enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| and so I made sure that the fire marshal had inspected the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| We forwarded information along to make sure that the state was aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| and so I think we addressed those immediate needs about equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| And then, obviously, the owner was given, I guess, a notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| and had then come through the BZA process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Well, aside from the BZA process where they were looking at the pure zoning thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| are there outstanding code issues that your department has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| I'm not aware of any of those, and it's my understanding the fire marshal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| his team had looked at that and there weren't any issues during their last inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| I don't have those dates with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| But I did talk with the fire marshal and then the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| because Mr. Sammons had brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| I just wanted to get sort of some background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Any other discussion from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| I have one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| So I think that, to go back to Mr. Frost's comment, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| these are narrow lots on Magnolia that don't have room for a driveway to go in between the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1718)|
| 0:28:46| so you have to access off the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| And, you know, the hardship is if we're converting a former use as probably a residence or some sort thereof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| and then trying to make it a commercial piece of property, that's the hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| It's been that way for a long time, and I don't find any objection to it and plan to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1741)|
| 0:29:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| So we have a motion by Mayor Brown to deny the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| and there's a second, and so we will vote by roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Councilman De La Voppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Yes, meaning voting for the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| To deny it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Vice Mayor Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| The denial of the appeal passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| We'll now move on to 10B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| 10B is a resolution approving an appeal by John Zimmerman, Northwest Community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision to approve Helen Ross McNabb's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| for a use and review for a behavioral health urgent care center in an O1 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| property located at 3343 DeWine Road, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Mr. Zimmerman, did you all choose your three speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| Why don't you all come on down, the three speakers, and you can tell me who that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| We'll start again with the appellants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| So, Mr. Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Who are your three speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| You and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| Mr. Johnston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Mr. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Mr. Johnston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| And Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| So, not Margie Marsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| So, name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer, and I'll give you a notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| when you're about a minute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| My name is Chris Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| I'm an attorney with the law firm Lowe, Yeager & Brown, located at Suite 2102 in the BB&T| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| building at 900 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| I'm here on behalf of Appellant John Zimmerman and other concerned citizens in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| to the use on review of the proposed facility to house criminal offenders in Northwest Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| Jason Long prepared a position statement on behalf of our client, which each of you should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| have a hard copy of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| And at the outset, I want to make clear that our client does not object, does not oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| the concept of this sort of facility in our community, and in providing an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| to incarceration in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| Rather, it is the location of this particular facility that our client opposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| In consideration of the nature of that facility, i.e., that it is not a hospital, an acknowledgement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| that such a facility is not a permitted use on review, counsel must reverse the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| Now, first of all, to start out, the building inspector has made the determination that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| it's a hospital, and hospitals are permitted use on review in an 01 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| But we need to look at the facts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| This is not a hospital that is open, whose predominant purpose is to provide medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| care to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| The only way into this facility is through the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| If counsel wants a more honest and frank appraisal of what type of facility this truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| is, I would suggest to look at the RFP, the addendum to the RFP, and the bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| For example, in response to a question regarding the level of medical care that will be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1964)|
| 0:32:53| at this facility, the addendum to the RFP states that any medical care, puts in quotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| marks, will be minimal and confined to simple first aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| And this is called a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| And then once admitted to this facility, individuals must stay confined to this facility for 72| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| hours, and if they want to leave the facility, they have to be taken into custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| Now, does that sound more like a hospital, or does that sound more like a detention facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| In reference to the legal status of the individuals at this facility, the addendum to the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| notes that the individuals are in protective custody or under a reconnaissance bond through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Again, this sounds more like a detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| Furthermore, the building inspector's blanket assurance that this facility will only house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| nonviolent offenders is contradicted by the RFP, which notes that among those defenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| being diverted to this facility are those arrested for disorderly conduct, which the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| RFP itself defines to include those exhibiting violent or threatening behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| And additionally, the district attorney general can refer to the facility individuals charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| with more serious crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| Now, the O1 district is intended to mediate the transition between residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| which this site is surrounded by on three sides, and more intensive developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2063)|
| 0:34:30| This facility is simply incompatible with the character of this particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| Furthermore, the RFP and the zoning applications do not address the public safety aspect of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2076)|
| 0:34:44| this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| This type of facility has never been conceived before in Knoxville, and dropping it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| middle of residential neighborhoods is simply unwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| To conclude, calling this facility a hospital to be charitable is forcing a square peg into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| a round hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| This facility does not fit under any of the permitted uses on review for an O1 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| and for this reason, council should reverse MPC's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| And before I give up the podium, I would like to ask everyone who's in favor of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| appeal and who opposes the use on review to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Now, Barbara Cooke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Ms. Cooke, if you'd please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Barbara Cooke, 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| We are here tonight requesting that you vote in favor of our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| We recognize this will not be an easy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| As you contemplate your position, we know that it will be difficult to separate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2163)|
| 0:36:11| knowledge of the operation that is proposed for the building on DeWine Road, your respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2171)|
| 0:36:20| for the principles, and for the noble objectives involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| It will be difficult to separate those thoughts from the fundamental issue of what's in a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2187)|
| 0:36:37| A medication-assisted treatment program is being provided to addicts at the Knox County Jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2197)|
| 0:36:45| Does that make the jail a hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| By the very logic that induced the chief building official to determine that the operation proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| for the DeWine Road site meets the definition of a hospital, we propose that it more accurately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2216)|
| 0:37:04| meets the definition of a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| The occupants in this facility that this facility is intended to serve will be under the control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| of law enforcement prior to their arrival, while they're staying there, and when they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| This is a jail diversion facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| Just because there is a facility nearby, which happens to be operated by the same group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| that proposes to operate this facility, those are the folks that just happened to convince| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| the neighborhood 20 years ago to forego their protest at the time and allow them a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| using the same hospital argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| It's no reason to assume that this facility qualifies as a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| This is a jail diversion facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| This is a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| Please don't be deceived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| Joshua Johnston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Put your name and address to the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Joshua Johnston, 5108 Fleetwood Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| I live on the cul-de-sac at the top of DeWine Road, about three-tenths of a mile from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| proposed jail diversion site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| To give you a little background, my wife and I moved to East Tennessee in the summer of 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| after relocating frequently while I served as an Air Force officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| Our plan was to leave Knoxville immediately as soon as I received my doctorate degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| and move to another city to live permanently, start a family by adopting children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| However, over the years of my schooling, we, like many of the people in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| fell in love with Knoxville, and we decided to call this community our permanent home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| Unfortunately, my part of the community is currently being threatened by a new facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| that the city is referring to as a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Now, I've spoken to other members of my community who are represented here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| and to my neighbors on the cul-de-sac on which I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| and we all agree that this is simply not safe for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| The location for this facility has been approved based on a loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| The definition of hospital is being stretched beyond what any of us in this room would intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| the word to mean in our conversation and our writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| If this were really a hospital, members of our community could have their own health issues treated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| but only those who have broken the law will be admitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| The word hospital is merely being used as a euphemism to disarm those of us who are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| and to push this plan through unobstructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| However, as I understand it, this type of zoning that the property falls under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| is intended to protect those of us who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| It's intended to protect us from heavy commercial operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| because in a residential area, these types of businesses would be inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| Instead, the zoning allows for businesses that add value to our lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| doctors, dentists, attorneys, and yes, even real hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| However, this facility, which is being called a hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| is as inappropriate as the other facilities that the law prohibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| because its location violates the intention behind this type of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| The debate about the location is whether or not such a facility should be located in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| But that phrase is a little too sterile or too clinical for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| because I don't think of this as a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| It is my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| It's not a fancy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| We have very modest houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| We have modest incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Nonetheless, it is our neighborhood, and these are our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| In fact, there are 1,000 homes within a mile of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| and the nearest one is only 60 feet from the current building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| Those of us who live in these 1,000 homes are concerned about the overall safety of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| Now, it's easy to sit here and say there are no safety concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| but I would ask you to consider how satisfied you would be with such a dismissive answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| if this facility were in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| Would you assume that everything was perfectly safe for your own toddler with this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| only three-tenths of a mile down the road, or would you have concerns too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| The truth is you don't have to consider that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| You don't have to wonder whether or not your adopted baby girl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| who you finally got to bring home from China, is safe in her backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| But I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| One of the aspects about this project that the council is proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| is that the facility is unlike anything else in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| It's a pilot program, an experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| And while you are right about being excited about doing something that's innovative and new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| in fact, everyone here in our community supports giving people the help they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| but you must admit that with any experiment, there are many unknowns, many variables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| many safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| And I could suggest 1,000 what-ifs and worst-case scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| but I would simply ask you to consider the appropriateness of this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| being built next to your house or being placed next to your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| At one point during the county commission meeting where this project was funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Helen Ross McNabb, representative, exhibited some more interesting wordplay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| when he claimed that this sort of facility was simply consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| with the other frontage on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| However, this property does not sit on Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| and it was not even visible from Western Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| until woods that separated our neighborhood from that large road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| were clear-cut as part of the ever-lengthening widening of Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| Referring to this as frontage is merely wordplay on the part of Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| And it's unfortunate to me that as dutiful citizens of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| involved community members here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| we have to hope that we say the right words and raise the right issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| I would ask that instead of making this an issue of rhetoric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| where we argue about what the word hospital does and does not mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| you would simply consider what is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| Instead of spending the mental energy considering how you can justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| calling this facility a hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| simply consider what would be right for your own neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| The same is right for all Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| We all deserve safety and security in our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| Now we'll hear, we have Houston Smeltzer and Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Who's going first, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| I'll start out if I may, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Mr. Smeltzer will go back me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| I'm here on behalf of the Helen Ross McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| This matter is on appeal from a unanimous approval of a use on review by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2605)|
| 0:43:34| I think the vote was 15-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Let me tell you what this appeal is not about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| It is not about whether or not this is a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| Mr. Peter A. Rands, the chief building official for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| has determined that this facility is a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| Anybody aggrieved by that decision must appeal his decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| To my knowledge, that appeal has not been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| The issue here today as set forth in the minutes from the MPC meeting are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| one, a hospital is permitted as a use on review in a 01 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| and this property is already zoned 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| It's been that way for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| It was a church before this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| The MPC staff reviewed carefully the use of this property for a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2667)|
| 0:44:37| Architects submitted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| There were landscape designs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| MPC staff recommended to the commission that there be five conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| on the use of this property as a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| MPC itself, when it came on for hearing before the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| added an additional condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| So there are now six conditions on this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| The project has been thoroughly vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| It has been through two neighborhood meetings, one of which I think lasted three hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| led by the sheriff, and I'm not sure if the chief of police was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| I think he was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| But the sheriff was at both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| This is a facility that is designed to house nonviolent offenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2728)|
| 0:45:37| who are brought or come into contact with law enforcement personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| who, for reasons of alcohol or substance abuse or mental issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| do not need to be placed in our jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| They need the help that this facility can provide, which would be three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| and it's voluntary for the person being brought there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| If he objects, he can go on to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| But it is voluntary for people who think that they can be helped by mental health intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| and that is what Helen Ross McNabb does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| As I mentioned, they went to two public hearings before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| The MPC voted unanimously that this was an appropriate use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| with the conditions placed on it for this property, which was already zoned 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| It went to a county commission where it was the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| and contract for the operation of this facility was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| It came here four weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| And this council unanimously, I believe it was four weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| unanimously approved or authorized the mayor to execute an agreement with Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| for this facility whereby the city would fund part of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| and fund its operation for three years along with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| The objection seems to be this is not a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| That issue is not before this body tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| That has already been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| If that is the objection of Mr. Zimmerman and his group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| their route was to appeal this to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| which to my knowledge they have not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| So the issue is are the conditions and the findings of the MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| and is this an appropriate site for location of a hospital with the conditions placed upon it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| We ask you to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Now, some issues were raised about how the facility would operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| and Mr. Smeltzer from Helen Ross McNabb is here to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| Thank you. Name and address, and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| Houston Smeltzer, Helen Ross McNabb Center, 201 West Springdale Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| I think the major conditions that we came to were really produced primarily by our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| One dealt with transportation to and from the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| Initially we knew that law enforcement, either Chief Roush or Sheriff Jones' staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| would be bringing these folks to the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| but that there would be an opportunity for the folks, their family, to come pick them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| a spouse, a parent, someone like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| There were still concerns about our ability to vet the people who would be picking these folks up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| and so we agreed that anybody coming to or leaving this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| would be transported by Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| There's also a concern about access to the parking lot coming from DeWine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| We actually agree with that, and so we're working very closely with the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| and we're encouraged by the opportunity to move that over to the ball camp side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| So those were, I think, the two big focal points of the six conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| and if there are any other questions, I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Now, Mr. Field, you get up to two minutes for rebuttal if you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| Mayor, I'll waive any rebuttal, but we'll address any questions that any council members may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Okay, Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Yeah, before Mr. Field sits down, I might as well start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| You know, this body had a month ago, as was represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| the question of whether we were willing to help fund such a safety center or rehab center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| and I think we said yes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| And I don't think there's much question in this broad community about that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| as should we have some alternative to repeatedly jailing people who are mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| or have drug abuse issues and end up treating them in the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| and I don't think your group even challenges that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| So would you please address the question of whether or not you can challenge the significance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3000)|
| 0:50:09| of a hospital designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| As I heard the statements, Peter Ahrens is the code interpreter or the head of that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3011)|
| 0:50:19| He said it was a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| I've looked at the definition in Article 2 of the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| and it doesn't seem to use the word and open to members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| It talks about a place available for treatment and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Maybe we should drag that Section 2 out and read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| But the question has been raised or the proposition has been raised that it's not open for review here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3037)|
| 0:50:47| and I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| I'm concerned about whether we can look into that or whether our hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| But a big part of your argument lies on is it a jail or detention facility or is it a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| So please address that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| That's a fair summary of what our position is, and we're actually in the process of appealing that to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3061)|
| 0:51:12| And to be honest with you, Councilman, I don't know if we can take that issue up properly procedurally now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3072)|
| 0:51:25| or whether that determination is set in stone or whether Council can address that determination in the course of this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3085)|
| 0:51:37| Well, that's a pretty important cliff that we're at here because your folks make a good argument that this is more like a jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| that has medical treatment than a hospital that's open to people who are sick and come in voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| I heard the definition of voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| You can go to jail or go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| That doesn't sound too voluntary to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| You want to be shot or you want dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| It's a tough choice there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Maybe Council Swanson or Frost can tell me a little bit more about this hospital decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| and where that leaves us because that's important as a threshold for us to get across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Under Article 7, Section 1C of the code, the Board of Zoning Appeals has the power to hear and decide appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| where it's alleged that the chief building official has made some error in a determination related to the administration of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3143)|
| 0:52:34| And so Mr. Aarons is the chief building official who has made that determination that has not been appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3154)|
| 0:52:43| It has been later or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| I know that several weeks ago at least, almost as much as a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| Mr. Zimmerman was provided with the information about the availability of an appeal of that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| to the Board of Zoning Appeals and was provided with the necessary forms to file that appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| Is that time sensitive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| There is not a time limit listed in the code with regard to when you can file that appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| But the question is can you consider tonight whether that is a correct interpretation or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| And the answer is no because until the Board of Zoning Appeals or in some appellate process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| determines that that was an incorrect determination by the chief building official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| that's the interpretation that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| And that is not subject to overturning in this particular form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| because what you have before you is the appeal of the granting of the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| Right. And his argument is you never get to that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| because you don't have a thing that is a permitted use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| But that begs the question of who decides what's a hospital and how do you challenge it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| Well, they've known that for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Okay. And is there procedurally a way to suspend any decision here until that question is heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3235)|
| 0:54:04| What do we do? Do we hear these things seriatim and one's already decided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3244)|
| 0:54:11| If the appeal was pending, you might make a motion to postpone this particular hearing until that was resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3251)|
| 0:54:20| But that seems kind of unusual to make a motion to postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| to determine whether or not an appeal is going to be filed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| And, MPC, do you have a role in making a decision on what is a hospital or is not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| Not specifically, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| There were discussions with Peter during the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| but the decision rests with the chief building official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| Okay. So he's the interpreter of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| Let me ask the question as to what about this idea of changing the road access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3293)|
| 0:55:02| I saw stuff in the record that said that there was a big concern about the traffic in and out with prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| and how does that affect community safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| And someone suggested, probably from the BZA, why not take it in another way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| And there was a whole big discussion about can you cross a creek or some other water body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| Where are we on that? Is that resolved in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| John Zimmerman, 5805 Briarview Lane, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| And I just wanted to speak to the things that you brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| We are in the process of starting the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| I do have the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| My intention was to turn those in this morning, or actually this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| I wanted to go over and seek counsel, obviously, before I did submit those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| I wanted to make sure that was done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| So I had begun the appeal and have the information, the form here from Scott Elder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| So we are in the process of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| The point today was to bring up what was the lack of discussion we felt like at the MPC, at the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3357)|
| 0:56:06| We spoke to the standards by name, line by line, as to what our objection was to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| and felt like it did not live up to the standards, general harmony for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| So our intention today was to, obviously, to tell our side of it, but as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| That this doesn't fit into your residential community, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| But in the process, at the use on review, for those of you that have watched it or watched the video there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3388)|
| 0:56:35| it was just a lack of concern for what we brought, the questions we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| And so that's why we appealed to you, to the city council, to make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| We felt like we were not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| There was not discussion or debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Only for the, to move the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| So that was our reasoning for being here today and to tell our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| But moving the entrance does help somewhat, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| It's the facility itself that troubles you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| That was, the point that that was brought up was not a major concern and that was frustrating to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| because we had these other questions that were not talked about, only the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| And that was not important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| Can I ask Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Well, and just one more point about your initial question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| about whether the determination of this as a hospital being open for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| I mean, more generally speaking, this all goes to whether the use is in harmony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| with the general purpose and intent of zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| So to that extent, I think you can consider what the more specific use of this facility is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| and whether it is in harmony with the zoning regulations for this particular district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| and the adjacent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| If I could ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Councilman, how about, Councilwoman Palmer's light's been on for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| You want to, let's hear from somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| We can come back to you if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Eventually, I'd like to ask someone about what is the facility next door now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| and how is this different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| I mean, I want to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| You want to go ahead, Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| I've reviewed Mr. Zimmerman's appeal of decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| I watched the MPC meeting when this occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| I've also reviewed the record and the material from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| I've reviewed the standards for granting uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| as set forth in the record and the zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| I adopt the MPC staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| It was 15-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| I am in agreement that the proposal is consistent with the adopted plans and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| It is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| The proposed use is compatible with the character of the neighborhood where it will be situated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| The use will not significantly injure the value of the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| The use will not draw substantial additional traffic through residential streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| and the nature of the development in the surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| will not create an undesirable environment for the proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| Therefore, I move to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| Do you have more questions you want to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| I did want to get that second point, and I'm going to ask Mr. Smeltzer and or Chris Field to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3562)|
| 0:59:32| We've got a facility already there, and Helen Ross McNabb has taken the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| we're already treating people who have addictive behaviors or conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| I just want to understand, it's somewhat different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| How are they the same? How are they different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| You're bringing in people who have already been arrested into this new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| So discuss that for me briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| That's the primary difference, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| The existing facility, Centerpoint, does not have anyone transported who has been arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| Our crisis stabilization unit, which is in the existing facility, is a similar type of program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| but those are folks who are transported from emergency departments that are in a psychiatric crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| We also have beds for people who need to be medically monitored while they're detoxing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| They come in from a health pathway into your facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| All right, and now we're going to have people that are brought over who have the same kinds of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| but they've been arrested for doing disorderly behavior or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| They have not been arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| I'm talking about in the new facility they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| No, they have not been arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| They have not been arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| They're diverted from the arrest? Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| Diverted from the arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| How about Chief? Help me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| So what happens is the officer, while they have committed an offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| they are given the option of going to this facility instead of being charged with the offense at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| So they're not charged formally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Right. It's a diversion from being charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| But doesn't a magistrate or judge have to agree to send them there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| No. So what will happen is the officer will bring them to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| They will talk to a magistrate about the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| and that issue will be set aside as long as they agree to go through treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| It's a treatment facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| Well, thank you. That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| Mr. Fields, I'll give you a minute if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Do you have something to say about that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| I think you hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Are they different or the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| I think you hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| They're different because of the avenue in which they enter the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| It's apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| One's coming in from a health care perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| The other's coming in through the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| So that's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| Chief Roush would like to add something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| If I may, we actually are taking people to the facility now that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| The one that's there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| We take people there now that are having mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| So an officer in the field can see someone having this crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| and says let's get you where you can get some help, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Is there any other discussion, counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| We have a motion by Councilwoman Palmer to deny the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| a second by Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Yes, to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Yes, for the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3752)|

| 1:02:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Councilman De La Voppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| I'm going to vote no because I think that open question still needs to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| Okay, the motion to deny the appeal passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3780)|

| 1:06:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| 11H is the resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| and sale agreement with Knoxville Supreme Court LLC to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| and develop a certain real property located at 719 Locust Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| for a purchase price of $2,600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| Councilman Dove, let me tell you, Council, first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| we have two people signed up to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| It is Nick Kazana and Justin Kazana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| The developer, Mr. Dover, and the architect are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| They haven't signed up, but I'm sure they're here to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| that you all might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Yeah, I guess I want to defer to hear those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| but I have one simple question I'd like answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| We had a pretty long workshop the other day about this and got some background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| I'm troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| The documentation before me talks about a five-year period to build this project out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| It has a year for the inspection of the site, which is four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| the design period where they submit plans and schematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| and then another period of four months for the closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| So you eat up a year until you get to the closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| You have a year then to start construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| which I assume involves further planning or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| and then three years to build the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| That's a pretty long time, five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| and I thought the other proposal was about three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| Is that five years sort of set in stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| In other words, it's permitted by the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Can someone tell me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| Yes, Dr. Lyons will address the question to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| Well, I guess we should establish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| are we going to want to get into comparing the proposals at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| I'm willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| I have the timeline for the other proposal right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| which is 4.1 years, and the actual proposal, that's for the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| So it's 4.1 to 5, that's what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| No, it's not 4.1 to 5, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| What we had in the Dover proposal originally was three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| Then we negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| I think I have to explain one thing to clarify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| and if you take a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| and that is this got us to the point of negotiating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| and what we got to was a number of points at which we would want to draw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| have the ability to draw the property back to the city if folks didn't perform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| and all along the way they will be investing time and resources to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| such that they obviously wanted more flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| given unknowns and contingencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| that we wouldn't be halfway through the project spending hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| and be at risk of the city then exercising that ability to pull the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| And I think—I don't know, who do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| Is Mark Mametoff here tonight or anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| Well, basically my—and maybe Charles may want to weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| but part of the negotiation to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| that was really where the tension was in the negotiating process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| and where we had, I think, one of the reasons it took the longest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| But I would expect that in any negotiation of this type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| because what we're doing is then getting into, okay, here's your timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| what is going to happen at each point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| and that was something that was back and forth between attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| where the city has an interest in moving as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| which is subordinated, of course, to the interest of getting a good project and getting it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| versus the proposers' interest in, again, not being—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| having too many resources at risk to be pulled back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Mr. Swanson, do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| Just that the answer to your question is that's the outside limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| That's the maximum time they can take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Surely they can complete it quicker than that if they can get it done in a reasonable basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| And we have every reason to believe that that's what their intention is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| but as reasonable and smart business persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| they want to give themselves as much time to get what needs to be done done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| and plan for the things that can't be planned for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| by giving themselves a little time to deal with those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| Virtually every significant deal I've ever been involved in negotiating with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| the folks who are doing the performing want to give themselves enough time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| Those who are trying to get something done want to take as little time as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| We engaged in a reasonable and, I thought, a good-faith negotiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| and ended up with these time constraints, and they don't seem unreasonable to me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| I'll defer any questions after the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Why don't we call on Nick Kazana and then Justin Kazana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4242)|
| 1:10:51| As you all know, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| and I'll set the timer, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Thank you very much, Ms. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| My name is Nick Kazana, 1225 East Wise Garber Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| For the record, our time frame to start and complete our project was three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| maybe three years and six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| That being said, nine months ago when we started this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| we felt comfortable that Knoxville definitely needed some new office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| Nine months later, today, we're positive Knoxville needs new office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| Let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Two and a half years ago, the city was negotiating with some developers, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| out of Chicago to build apartments and student housing on the Supreme Court site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| At the time, it was stated over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| we've got a huge surplus of office space downtown that we're not using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| And that might have been correct then, but today, in the last 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| we have 260,000 square feet of space in downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| that's either been occupied or going to be occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| Basically, we don't have any space left in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| If you want more than 15,000 square feet contiguous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| you can't find it in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| There's 5,000 here, there's 3,000 here, I think there's one floor with 15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| So we are out of space in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| and if new space isn't built, then we're going to be in a deficit position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| when someone wants to come to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| We know that we cannot live in Knoxville by apartments and hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| Now, I have a lot of hotel rooms, so I hope I'm not too far off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| But we need additional new offices in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| Now, I understand the city is a little concerned about our objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| but we're objecting because we like Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| We live in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| I've lived here for 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| I plan on living here for another 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| I think it's important that we realize that without office space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| to bring business to downtown Knoxville, that we will become stagnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| We've done a great job recently to the point that we've got 460 new hotel rooms coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4397)|
| 1:13:24| We've got all sorts of apartments, but what we don't have is one single office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4404)|
| 1:13:32| I thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| I thank the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| I thank you all for taking the leadership in buying this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| and keeping it in the city so that someone will develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| and we hope it will be for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| I appreciate the council in answering all my questions over the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Justin Kazana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| Justin Kazana, 824 Hansmore Place, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Let's continue the trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| The continued trend of growth that's happened in downtown Knoxville over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| Barge, Wagner, Sumner, and Cannon, Elo Touch, Amerigasco, Pixel, Tombris Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| Leitner, Williams, and Dooley, and Regal Cinemas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| Those are the names, just the big names, that are moving to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| That does not include all the smaller offices, the 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 square foot offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| that are moving to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| As a partner at Avison Young, which is Knoxville's largest commercial real estate firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| we represent more than a half dozen significant tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| that want to move into the central business district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| One of those tenants was actually asked by a member of the administration recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| what can we do to move you from out west to downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| And their response to me was, I'm not moving my company into a 30-year-old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| That was a company that needed 15,000 square feet and had over 100 employees at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| One of the key statements when valuing the real estate as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| whether it's residential or whether it's commercial, is its highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| Knoxville's proven over the last decade that the highest and best use of space can vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| However, we've also found that you can put apartments in a variety of places in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| We've seen the success of Marble Alley, what's happened on Central Avenue and also on Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| We've seen that success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| But for office, it's a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| You have to have ease of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| You have to have retail to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| The highest and best use of the Supreme Court site is and has to have some type of office product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| That being said, with new office products, you have to have technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| New tenants, young tenants, growing high technology tenants have to have that technology to grow and operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| Connectivity is the big word around commercial office space these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| And you've got to have that in new office buildings that 30-year-old office buildings no longer have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| They have larger footprints and layouts to create more efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| And a new office building is going to have a carbon footprint that is 40% smaller than its competitor that's 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4557)|
| 1:16:05| That is a pretty significant number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Most importantly, it's a platform for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| So new companies can come to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| We want Henley Center to be the launching pad for Knoxville's new industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| Now, if you take a look at some of our peer cities you'll find around the southeast, Greenville, Birmingham, Durham, Tallahassee, Mobile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4577)|
| 1:16:25| all of them building significant office space in the central business district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| And I'm not talking about one 75,000-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| We're talking hundreds of thousands of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| Mobile, Alabama just built 400,000 square feet in downtown, and it is 98% occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| That is a significant number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Knoxville has not had a new office building in downtown in 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| And if this site doesn't become office or at least have an office component, I think it will be another 7 to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| Lots of people will rely on the TVA site as a potential new office space, and yes, it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| But let's also remember today was actually the one-year anniversary of TVA announcing it was going to potentially move or find a new site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4620)|
| 1:17:08| What's happened in that last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Best-case scenario, if TVA awards the developer to move them to a site this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| it will take three years to build a new building and then three more years to develop new properties on that exact site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| Also, those buildings, they're 40 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| There's $31 million worth of deferred maintenance for those TVA buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| There's a good chance Henley Center would be finished even before TVA got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| So can Knoxville wait until 2024 for a new office building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| Not if we want to continue the growth that we've had so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Yeah, I'd like to ask Senior Kazan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4670)|
| 1:17:58| We had a great discussion yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| This is a tough one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| The thing that Nick and I discussed yesterday was that I was happy that Mr. Dover had letters of intent, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4686)|
| 1:18:17| and I don't live in that world and I don't know how much further that you could get other than a letter of intent at this stage of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4697)|
| 1:18:25| But with the demand as high for the office space, it's just confusing to me as to was there not people willing to give you a letter of intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4705)|
| 1:18:38| or for that demand that you all have described?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| In discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| I mean, that's kind of the balancing, the thing that tips it for me one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| Well, a letter of intent is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| And what's going to happen three years from now, no one knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| At the interview with the committee, we told them that we have 15,000 square feet of space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| that folks indicated that they will sign a letter of intent if we get the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| That's all we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| We cannot go out or we couldn't go out since Mr. Dover was appointed and select any more letters of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4754)|
| 1:19:22| But I feel very comfortable that, first of all, I'm taking the risk, but I feel very comfortable with 75,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4762)|
| 1:19:30| That's extremely easy to reach whatever threshold the financial institution would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| And I'm not sure in today's market there would be a threshold for that small amount of office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| I hope that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Mr. Kazan is up at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| Well, one of the things that I guess surprised me as we started looking into this last week at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| and before was that several years ago, three or four years ago, you had a chance to develop this property with office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| but you weren't sure the market was going to carry you and you kind of opted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| And that seemed to say that that wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| How do you explain that disparity between then and now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| We were in a pretty deep recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| I've stated over and over again the deepest recession we've ever had since the Depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| No one wanted to start a large development back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| As a matter of fact, a component of that was a huge hotel, a full-service hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| And since that time, we have over 460 new hotel rooms coming online in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4840)|
| 1:20:49| so we felt that it was not appropriate to have another hotel component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| But there was no money available and no one wanted to take the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| But you're saying change conditions at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Totally change conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| The economic climate is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| What we did do at that time was we were able to secure the Holiday Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| Well, as Pablo said, this has certainly drawn a lot of our attention over the last few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| but really over the last few years as we've been on council and studied this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| I have had a real interest in this property and how it gets developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| I'm excited to see that after 20 years of being vacant that we will be able to develop this site hopefully soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| This is a key piece of real estate in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| I've said before that I think it's one of the best sites in downtown Knoxville for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4901)|
| 1:21:49| I had hoped that through the use of public property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| and what I expect that will become public finance through a pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| that that would cover the gap that we could force into some of our product mix in downtown what we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4920)|
| 1:22:09| and what we don't have anew, and that is office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| We do have, and there's plenty of lenders that will lend on apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| There's lenders that want to lend on a hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| and a hotel from the convention center, no one could really argue that that's not a good place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| But it's office that we don't have downtown, and I've said that for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| and since we started looking at it, and I was opposed to the apartments going on this site five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4955)|
| 1:22:41| and it was just strictly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| And I'm still there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| I had hoped that where we own the property, and I'm sure we're going to end up giving money on a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4967)|
| 1:22:55| that we can drive what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| Knoxville is at a point where we ought to be able to drive what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| and the way we want it to look and the way we want it to feel if we own the property as we do in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| and if we're going to end up giving money on a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| and I think that's something that ought to be part of the conversation as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| We should be able to dictate what properties look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| The style of this property has everything to do with the next property that's being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| This is going to set the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| And when we're asked to give money for public money, then public ought to have some input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5005)|
| 1:23:33| and public ought to have some input on how it's going to be used and what it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| and as we go forward, we should be able to drive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| And I guess that's the part that leaves me the most disappointed about this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| is that we didn't have that opportunity to speak into it until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| I feel like the information that we received on Thursday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| and to vote on it tonight is really unfair to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| and there's a lot of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| I am in total support of Rick Dover and his development team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| I have nothing but nice and fine things to say about Rick Dover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| I support Nick and what he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| I agree with some of his ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| I agree with some of Rick's ideas and believe that this is really so important that we get this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5059)|
| 1:24:28| and I think that's where the public input could have helped us develop it and collaborate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5068)|
| 1:24:36| It's not that they don't have good architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| It's not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| It's just that it's just so important that this thing be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| So I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I think it could have been better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| I think we could have gotten an office component out of it if we'd wanted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| In 2008, we weren't even at the bottom of the recession in 2008 for real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| and loans weren't even beginning to be called due in 2008 on commercial properties that I know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| and a part of, and we weren't even at the bottom then, and now we're at the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| and now it's going to continue to go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| and I think this is where we as a city and as a council had to be intentional about what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| and what we want is the best product and the best looking products in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| So my issues are not about one proposal over the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| It's really about where we want to go as a city and what the vision is for downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| and particularly how this property can lead that way in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| And I think our law director reminded me that we are speaking to this proposal that's before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| So is there more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| I mean, Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Yeah, I'd like to talk just to this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| I think we had a really good workshop the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| Mr. Cassano, you can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| Where I think a lot of questions were answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| and I do realize that we're really addressing the particular proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| but I just want to take the opportunity to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| and to reiterate some of the things that George has said and especially has said before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| that this is so crucial, this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| and really I'm addressing the Dover group, I guess, to say that from an aesthetic standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| that's one thing that I'm most concerned about in terms of what this is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| I think it's important that we really understand how this project really relates to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| the different items that were in the proposal that I know that some of us are going to be real interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| in seeing how it goes as we move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| But I do think that we have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| and we as a city have the opportunity to set the standards, set the goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| and as I've said before, we're the ones that ought to make that decision so that we should move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| But I think as far as what's on the table today in terms of the process that's been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| I think that this council and future councils will have the opportunity to work with the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| in terms of working on the next process, on the next public piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| But as far as this one goes, I think we need to move ahead and get it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| I make a motion that we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Make a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| To approve, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| Okay. Is there more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| Just a brief one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| I tend to agree with the last statement he said, which is it's time to move on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| but a lot of energy put into all the parties and the city's evaluation committee in looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5263)|
| 1:27:52| I don't understand this to be the last piece of land in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| and if we need offices I suppose there's another parcel somewhere that will serve that need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| whether it's removing an existing building or building in a parking lot or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| But I'm a little concerned that we want to be central planners to the point of deciding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| what a risk taker must build to suit our desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| I mean, we might be wrong, and the risk takers are out there saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| I want to build X, I've lined up some players, and if it goes south it's going to be my nickel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5304)|
| 1:28:32| You know, that's different than central planners telling you you've got to build this or that or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| but we don't take any risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| So I'm troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| I appreciate what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| We're trying to have a vision and look forward 10, 20 years as to what we need and what we want to become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5322)|
| 1:28:48| and I was impressed with the younger Kazana gentleman telling us that modern offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5328)|
| 1:28:56| and companies want to be in high-tech environments where all the cool wires are in the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| and the space is designed to maximize their space and minimize their footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| But here we are with a process that's gone on for probably too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| It's our third stab, according to what Bill told us the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| and we spent the last, I don't know, nine or ten months going from give me your proposal to where we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| So I think we need to act on what's on the table, yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| You've got to decide how you want to vote, but I think this is on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| and I guess there will be opportunities to troll in an office complex builder in a different site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| I'm not sure how that will happen, but the marketplace tends to decide those things, not city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| Anyway, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| Yeah, I just had one question to just be sure that we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| What's the next steps, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| We had talked about we approved the sale, and there's the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| Yes, the next step is the development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| and that gets more into detail than the purchase and sale agreement does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| Then we would have more detailed description of what they're doing laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| and, in fact, we would get to what would be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| We have to make sure that what is proposed is actually what gets constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| I would just say that's not always been the case, and we have to make sure that that is the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| and that's building in, you know, in the development agreement steps along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| to ensure that other than minor details, which we'd agree to, that once that comes before council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| that's what will, in fact, happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| We'll get right to work on that, assuming there's a positive vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| and I can't give you an exact timeline on that, but we sense one thing we have heard is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| there's obviously a lot of concern that we get something going on there sooner rather than later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| and that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| But you'll see the development agreement, which will be much more in the way of detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| and description of what will happen where drawings and design issues should come before you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| All right, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| Oh, it's still roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| Vice Mayor Grieve. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| Councilman Palmer. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| Councilman Pavlis. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Councilman Saunders. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Councilman Starr. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| Councilman Wallace. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| Councilman Brown. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Councilman Campin. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| Councilman De La Voppe. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| Passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| I would like to thank the staff who have worked on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| starting with our Purchasing Department with Boyce Evans and Janice McClellan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| the attorneys Mark Mamentoff and Jordan Nelson and Allison Dyer in our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| of course, Christy and Bill, who have worked tirelessly on this, Bill particularly taking the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5508)|
| 1:31:56| And we have heard what you've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| We want this to be, all of us want this to be a project that we can be very proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| and that meets the needs that we have downtown with the Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| and all the different needs that we have identified and that Mr. Dover has identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5529)|
| 1:32:15| There was letters of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| I know this is, you've put a lot of time into this, and there will be more time we will put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| But we know we are moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Third time's the charm, right, in terms of trying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| And I look forward to working with you, Mr. Dover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| Mayor, thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| On behalf of Bristol Development Corporation and my company, Dover Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| we could not be more thrilled and really look forward to working with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| Point of order, Mayor Brown, I didn't hear you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| Did you get on the roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| Yeah, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| You got a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| All right, well, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| I will tell you this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| We have now acquired South High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| That transaction has now closed, so the crews will be there tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| and we would love to have you all out next week sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| and look forward to doing the same thing soon on the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| as soon as we possibly can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| Thank you. All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| Let's get that South High going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| We'll look for a groundbreaking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| Okay, so let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| Item 12A is an emergency ordinance to amend Ordinance No. 0-84-01| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| to clarify the boundary description of the Tazewell Pike Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| Can I get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| I probably need to ask Charles, since we've got all the rest of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| Do you want to explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Explain what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| We are just clarifying the property description for all of our overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| We got into a situation where we were in litigation relative to the Hawkeye's Restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| and there was a question about whether a particular property that we were involved in litigation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| was included in an overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| and we started looking at the property description, and it didn't make a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| There was a property description that had been put on the overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| which is a problem for identifying exactly where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| So then we got concerned that we ought to look at all of our overlay district property descriptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| and lo and behold, we needed to clarify each of those overlay property districts so that they all made a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5664)|
| 1:34:32| So we're not adding any property to any overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| We're not taking any property away from overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| We're creating a property description that includes what the original property description was intended to include to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5679)|
| 1:34:46| but for whatever reason failed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| So you had a leak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| And they're on emergency, obviously, because we don't want to have any kind of surprise development in the interim in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5693)|
| 1:35:00| Would it be appropriate to make a motion to approve all the rest of these with one vote instead of going through each one of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5700)|
| 1:35:08| Here comes Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| He doesn't look comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170425?start=5713)|
