| 0:00:27| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=27)|
| 0:00:33| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=33)|

| 0:01:08| Have you made a super majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| Can we hear from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Can we hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Yours is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| No, you're too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=79)|
| 0:01:23| Okay, I want to start out by saying that I appreciate everyone being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| I appreciate the audience being here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| We have a number of people who would like to speak during public forum at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| The mixed-use ordinance that we're going to be reviewing tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=95)|
| 0:01:41| was an outgrowth of looking at the Bearden Village Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| And one of the things that I had asked in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| that we look at that from the standpoint of having housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| whether it's condos, apartments, whatever, in the C3 and the C6 zones there in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| especially along Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| there's been a lot of work looking at the possibilities of a mixed-use ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=123)|
| 0:02:10| that would cover that particular area, using that area as an example to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| But at the same time, the mixed-use ordinance that we've been reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| is also one that could be used all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| There may be some tweets and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| But one of the things that's happened that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| I've had several meetings with both Gerald and Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| talking about what we're really trying to get in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| especially within the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| There's been several public meetings also there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| And one of the things that we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| is the fact that basically what we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| is we absolutely want to be able to have housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| in order to go with the Bearden Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| which is to make a walkable green particular area in that particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| And one of the things that Gerald will be getting into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| he'll go into an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| We want people to understand also that this is really a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| It's really an opportunity for we as council to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| and to make recommendations and talk to Gerald and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| about what we see that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| The other thing to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| is that one of the things that we have been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| the last couple of days is the fact that, as council knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| there's going to be a review of the total zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| which should be announced fairly soon in terms of who's going to be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| And so we've had some questions in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| how much of a mixed-use ordinance should we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| as compared to the possibility of an overlay at the present time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| on the Bearden Village Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| an overlay that would actually, under the C-3, C-6 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| we could allow housing to be in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| with certain stipulations that would tie into the village plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| the goals of the village plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| And Gerald is going to address that in just a few minutes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| So the framework of the zoning, isn't that going to be a year-long job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| Well, see, that's part of what we were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| is the fact that that's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| well, it may even take two years to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| but a lot of the work has been looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| as far as a mixed-use district could be tied into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| and that would be a lot longer duration than being able to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| and immediately be able to get housing within the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| So that's Gerald's address to add as long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| and Peter's here also to answer questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| So with that, also, before we get started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| where's David Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| David, do you want to give us a quick accounting of the building we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| and the fact that any of us, if one, or anyone in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| that would like to have a tour after the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| David and his staff are going to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| in order to tour the new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| So David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Well, first, welcome, David Brace, Senior Director of Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| We're still in the soft opening for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| City Council, the mayor actually just started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| even back in the Victor Ashe era, buying some property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| knowing we would need to consolidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| and build a single public works facility in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Mayor Haslam then funded the acquisition and the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| and Mayor O'Hara has finished really pushing it into the end zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| and getting this first building constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| So you're in the Public Works Service Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| This is where civil engineering, traffic engineering, public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| the employee health clinic are all co-located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| The phase two piece of that is across the street behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| They're actually demolishing some existing buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| renovating the Fleet Heavy Shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| adding two fire bays for the Fleet Fire folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| And so essentially, almost all of the public works employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| will be at this location in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| You're in, really, what we call the Customer Service Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| We hope this becomes a great location that City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| members of the public, our customers use for neighborhood meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| our public meetings in engineering, civil engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| traffic engineering, and other folks lead in PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| It's a 45,000-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| Again, about 250, 275 employees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| It's a lead silver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Once we commission it, it'll be lead silver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| so you park on a pervious paver parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| We've got a green roof, a geothermal energy system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| So again, Mayor O'Hara, I know Council has tried to model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| good environmental energy sustainable models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| This is also a backup location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| Actually, myself and Colin Ickes are going to get on your calendar from KEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| Should the City-County building be rendered inoperable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| this is a secondary location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| It's got a full generator backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| It's a concrete, metal, durable building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| So if the City-County building was not usable for days or weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| this is the backup location, so that's another function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| We also have a health clinic facility where all of our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| specifically Police, Fire, and Public Works, get their physicals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| get any vaccines they need, the flu shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| It can also be a backup health facility if the health department has a critical need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| So this building has a lot of different uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| But again, we hope this room will be used by the public, by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| This room, the kitchen, the public bathrooms can be locked out at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| so that the public can use this space for meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| I will be available for tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| We'll get to see everything but the health clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| That's managed by a vendor, by a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| They have medications in there, so it's locked up at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| It's on a separate log.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| We'll get this floor and the engineering floor after this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| So if there's any questions now, I'll take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Again, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| When are you going to tunnel under the railroad tracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| I just sat in front of the rope and was tracking there for about eight minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| We will not be tunneling under the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Is there another exit that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| Yeah, you can exit on the Liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| You can also exit on the Bellbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Let me just say this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| I know a lot of times our rec centers and downtown meeting sites, they can be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| They can be challenging for some customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| This building is fully accessible, accessible parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| This room is accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| The restrooms are accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| We're on a CAT line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| We're on a bike line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| CAT actually rerouted and now comes down this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| It's Liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| It goes up and does a turn and comes back through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| So we've tried to make this a place where every customer, every citizen can get to very easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| and hopefully we'll take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| We've had some interesting requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| We already had a request for a baby shower in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| That was one of those, like, let's talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| How do we do baby showers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| I'm sure there will be some sort of fee if people really want to have their baby shower with a public works complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| So, again, yes, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| Is there a fee if you're not an organized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| What are the fees, if any, if you're a group of citizens meeting for a concerned topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| For a neighborhood group or a group of citizens, there most likely will not be a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| We've already had the Westview community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| We're in the Westview neighborhood, which is in this Palmer's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| We actually had a neighborhood meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| I anticipate in the future Westview will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| We're fortunate we have a 24-7 staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| We're night shift, just like KPD, KFD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| And so we can, again, walk out the engineering space where our employees meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| and very easily have a single employee here at night or in the evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| So if you ever have a request, you can contact the city's 215-34-311 or just 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| And we're still working out how to get that scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| but 311 is the way you would work on getting something scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| You can call 311, but some folks' cell providers won't dial that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| so you have to call 215-4-311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| So some folks' cell providers and home phones will dial directly 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| other than you have to put in the first four digits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| David, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Thank you also for the drinks and the snacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Yeah, I was going to say, we've got cookies, ice tea, and coffee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| and the public restrooms are right outside the door here at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Okay, next we're going to go ahead and jump right into the proposed mixed-use zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| and Gerald Green, who's the executive director of NBC, along with Mike Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| will lead the discussion, lead the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| And first of all, I do want to say I want to thank Gerald and thank Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| for all the work that they've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| They've spent a numerous number of hours and a lot of good information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| and, Gerald, we're looking forward to your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Thank you, Vice Mayor Green, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| It's a pleasure to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| and I want to also thank Mike Reynolds, who's sitting up on the front row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| for the work that went into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| For those of you who have reviewed the draft, the preliminary draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| and the uncompleted draft, it's a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| It's a lot of work and effort went into where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| With that, I'll start with an overview, and this is an overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| largely because I don't know the complex stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| When you get to the detailed questions, Mike's going to come up and answer all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| I say that because, again, he has done all the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| and I appreciate the effort that he's put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| First, I'll start with what is mixed-use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| and it's a type of urban development that tries to incorporate residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| commercial, cultural, even industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| for those functions of physically and functionally integrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| meaning there are ways to walk or travel from one part to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| and also their functions work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| where you can work, live, and play in one little neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| where you don't have to get in an automobile or something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| to go to another location to do those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| and that provides pedestrian connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| One of the keys of the mixed-use is enabling people to walk from one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| again, the place where they live, the place they work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| or the place they want to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| It can take the form of a single building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| which is what we would often see in a redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| to a city block or entire neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| The North Shore Town Center is an attempt at a mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| Having seen others, I think maybe the initial plan was a bit overzealous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=739)|
| 0:12:28| and so I wouldn't use that as the only example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| but that's our closest example here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| There are benefits, including the greater housing variety and intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| As we look at accommodating in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| according to population projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| by 2040, another 160,000 to 180,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| we've got to learn how to use our land more intensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| how to get more people, whether we like it or not, in less space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| and that's what we reserve those rural areas in East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| North Knox County, even open spaces within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| How can we accommodate those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| And another important point to keep in mind is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| if you develop more intensely, the value of that land goes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| and then tax returns increase on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Reduced distances between housing work comes down on the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| The challenges that we saw on I-40 going west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| as we came here, that there's not as much traffic on those highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| so we cannot better utilize our existing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| More compact development, again, more efficient use of our resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| Stronger neighborhood character, when you have people walking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| they get to know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| I'm fortunate, I live in a neighborhood where a lot of people walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| and I have a front porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| so I've gotten to know lots of people in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| that otherwise I wouldn't have gotten to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| Pedestrian and bicycle-friendly environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| these are all policies that we're trying to achieve here in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| Will we end up with a collection of town centers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| Not necessarily. Here's some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| The one on the left is in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| The center one is, no, I'm sorry, Charlotte, Atlanta, Kalamazoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| and the other two, I just pulled off the internet, I have no idea where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| But you can look, they're like a town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| The one in Charlotte is actually Birkdale Village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| which is part of a town center, a new town, for lack of a better name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| The Atlanta is an older neighborhood that was redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Kalamazoo is a redevelopment of older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Infill within the urban center, I'm not sure where, again, these two are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| but this is just a single building, that's a mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| And redevelopment areas will likely be the single building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| where someone purchases a lot or an existing building, redevelops it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| and then it may fill in, and that's what we'd likely see along our corridors in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| where first it was a single building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| And like anything else that's new, no one wants to invest in something they're unsure of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| so it takes someone with some initiative and some nerve to do that first building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| and then others watch it to see if it's successful, and then it starts moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| That's what happened in Atlanta in this neighborhood, the one in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| Someone did one building, and then it just doesn't last very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| And it's always office and commercial, lower level residential development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| Typically, but also, you know, the mixed use could be either vertical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| which would be this, where you'd have offices or restaurants or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| commercial, and then residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Or it could be horizontal, where one building is a three-story office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| next to it is a four-story condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| And what we try to do is look at it from a neighborhood scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| as well as an individual building and not limit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| And that's what these standards have been drafted to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| would allow flexibility for the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Again, that could be a single-use building or a mixed-use building within that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| And the goals of mixed-use standards are to permit those various uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| to be located in the same district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Again, either vertically or horizontally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| Encourage multimodal transportation use so that people aren't limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| to their automobile, but can drive, bike, catch the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| And that intensity of use also encourages transit use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| because with more people living there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| potentially more riders, more frequent transit operation along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| Create a pleasant pedestrian environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Sidewalks, landscaping, and buildings with a pedestrian orientation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| which means this is an example of one of our existing mixed-use neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| Vice Mayor Green may recognize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Lots of entrances, entrances you walk along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| We all realize that walking along a sidewalk that has speeding cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| or nothing of interest on the side is not as pleasant as walking along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| where you hear windows away from your neighbors or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| Most mixed-use districts establish basic design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| It's interesting that in the 1880s, 90s, and turn of the past century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| we didn't need design standards to have buildings like that constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Now we do, and I'm not sure if that's a step forward or a step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| If that works in an Emory place like that, or places in Deerden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| or maybe downtown Burlington, what happens in a residential neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| Do you have the same redevelopment? Do you tear houses down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| What we're proposing is that these would not be mapped in residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| They would be along corridors, commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Actually, instead of detracting from that residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| we kind of would add to it because there would be more places to shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| more opportunities to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| My daughter may not want to buy a 2,000-square-foot house in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| especially since I live in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| She probably wouldn't like to live in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| But she may like to live in a 900-square-foot condo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| that's over a favorite coffee shop on Broadway somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| So that provides an opportunity for a variety of housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| within a broader neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| We're shooting at the commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| One of our goals with this was to assure that it would be appropriate corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| And why Deerden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| The big reason was to implement the Deerden Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| That plan was prepared in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| It identified the goal of creating a more walkable community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| and there have been several other initiatives that support that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| There are things like greenway improvements, sidewalks, landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| the creation of the Everly Brothers Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| are all part of that Deerden Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| And there is interest now from property owners and residents in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| to create a mixed-use district in Deerden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| so that new types of development can get underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| And one of the challenges that we had, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| and we looked at a couple of different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Vice Mayor Green talked about the C-3 and C-6 amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| and the overlays to accomplish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| And we started looking at how we could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| and meet all the goals of the Deerden Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| It was challenging, and I'm going to go through three slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| with those goals and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| They're pretty extensive recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| and trying to meet all those with a simple approach was challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| The recommendations include mixed-uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| retail and bottom and office residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| of subsequent buildings in front of the street, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| parking oriented to the back, buildings facing the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| with formal entrances at the front and adequate pedestrian shelter cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| building orientation toward the street, consistent building form type regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| enhanced sense of place and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| And all these sketches that are on these slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| are from the Deerden Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| Enhanced neighborhood activity and access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| encouraging the private sector to construct and improve sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| develop redevelopment and new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| sidewalk widths at least eight feet wide in front of buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| parking to the back of buildings with buildings running on sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| required parking to the side and back of buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| with green space and sidewalk connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| reduced parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Still heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| That's a big issue on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| It's everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| And none of the recommendations in this plan address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| The text of the plan talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| but the recommendations did not address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| I think that the authors of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| wisely realized what a challenge that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| and didn't saddle us with that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| or maybe they thought they had enough recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Pedestrian amenities such as lighting, seating, shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| public open spaces and plazas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| formal landscaping, small public spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| develop guidelines and development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| for an overlay district or mixed use zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| and ensure that development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| within the new zone are followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| So that's a pretty tall order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| to accomplish with standards and amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| and that resulted in the complexity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| and the detail of the draft ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| that you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| This is the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| as identified in the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| I know the residents of Pond Gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| are concerned about Bearden neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| losing its identity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| because part of the reason of losing that identity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| would be it being included in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| But what we look at as the mixed use district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| is that that plan area is identified in that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| that was done in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| So it's one block on either side of Kingston Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| This is Kingston Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| This is Western Plaza, Kingston Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| winding throughout the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| down to North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| Sutherland is the northern boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| except on this west of Lebanon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| the boundary shifts over to the north side of Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| It goes up to Tobler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| I believe it's Tobler, just short of Tobler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| and across Little Houston Park is the Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| And then it does include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| the Humber area and then over to Portland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| Are we allowed to take questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| In terms of community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| I started with a quote from the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| that that plan was developed and put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| with a very involved community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| And then during the development of the mixed use standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| we've had two public meetings in the Bearden community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| at the Bearden United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| one in June and one in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| There was also a dropping community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| up near a bread that we started, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| at three in the afternoon and stayed until seven or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| I think, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| And I've been to more meetings than I can recount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| But I remember what happened at all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| And also meetings with community groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| We've met with the Bearden Council a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| met with, I'll get the wrong neighborhoods, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| but Forest Heights, Forest Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| and then another neighborhood group that were all together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| We've also met with individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| and had some good discussions with individual property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| and neighborhood representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| and are trying to identify what their concerns and issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| The items addressed in the draft standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| I think, is this in Madison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| It's in St. Paul, Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| St. Paul, Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| And that's an example of a mixed use building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| And that's one, going back to one of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| about whether it was several buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| or just a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| You can see, going down the street here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| this is a major corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| but it's going down towards a residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| and it's a single mixed use building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| It's one example of what could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| And what we addressed in those draft standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| of designation as zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| the permitted uses, the maximum heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| development standards for buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| and not the property with lot dimensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| building design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| frontage, which address setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| setbacks and build new lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| as well as the orientation of the building to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| landscaping and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| So we tried to address all those goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| that were recommendations identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| in the Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| I used the royal weed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| because actually Mike did all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| This is the current zoning in Hyde Point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| and as you can see, there's a real mix of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| C6, C4, C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| Office 1, residential, shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| even some leftover industrial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| from when Humber was more of an industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| And the height limits go from 35 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| to an established one of 90 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| in the C3 district for office uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| to unlimited heights in certain districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| where the height is determined by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| as part of the plan review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| This was what we proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| with three districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| the neighborhood mixed use, the office mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| and the commercial mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| reducing the plethora of zoning districts to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| and proposed maximum heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| trying to keep within the range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| of the existing maximum heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| And the thought was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| how do you choose that proximity to lower residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| Proximity to residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| and the character of the existing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| and the height limits established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| by the existing zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| On the height limits, we tried not to vary far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| from the existing height limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| There was one concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| and this is down in the shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| down next to North Shore and Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| where the neighboring residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| one of the lower height limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| the managers of the shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| wanted a greater height limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| and that's how do we balance those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| And I think if we get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| that's an area for further conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| And the current status of the draft ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| that's Mike on the Friday before UT came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| with his orange shirt on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| The MPC staff is still drafting the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| The initial draft has not been reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| and endorsed by all of MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| We're still in the drafting stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| It has not been reviewed by city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Just to inform you of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| for drafting an ordinance amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| this applies to this as well as apartment ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| and our subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Staff works on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| and maybe one or two staff members charge with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| And it's given MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| and it's given to a broader circle of MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| for review and revision and comment and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| Once MPC staff has gotten comfortable with the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| it goes to what I'll call a panel of city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| that represent plans and plans review department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| the engineering department, the legal department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| the sustainability office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| anyone in the city who wants to review that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| or draft weighs in and we meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| until everyone's comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Then it's presented to the metropolitan...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Well, first to community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| then to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| then on to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| So it's a fairly involved process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Again, the city staff has not reviewed the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| other than Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| The final staff draft has not been presented to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| and has not been reviewed nor acted on by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| But all those subsequent groups can blame Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| By the time it gets to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| it's probably so different from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| It's like the parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| It's so different from what it started with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| that it bears no resemblance and can't blame anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| It's like a camel at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| And the challenges and opportunities...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| One of them is addressing the many...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| This is what Vice Mayor Grieve alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| While we're at a fairly significant decision point this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| in the jury input and guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| addressing the many recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| of the Beard Village Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| developing standards that deal with new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| and redevelopment, and that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| that Mr. Dillon and I and Mike have discussed numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| How do you create standards that require new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| to look a certain way and act a certain way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| and not hinder the redevelopment and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| of existing development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| And that's a challenge point, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| Attaining the many goals we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| results in a complex ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| The comprehensive zoning ordinance update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| is to start early next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| The Plans Review Department is not equipped at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| to administer another ordinance with detailed standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| and requires quite a lengthy review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| and a lot of time to review those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| What type of ordinance amendment does Council want us to continue with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| Do we do this detailed mixed-use ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| and try to address unresolved issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| and work with the city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| in the review and revision of the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| We're going to provide a mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| for the administration of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| which will be an involved process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| We'll work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| in the application of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| and that includes the residential community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| the overall beer community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| the development community, the pond gap community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Or the other option is that revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| to the green C-6 districts with no relay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| It's a faster process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| It's less complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Much of the work that the public has already done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| in taking the standards that we have developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| and applying them to an overlay district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| could be applied to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| and the existing zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| so we could use those on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| through application of an overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| It would be a bridge to a mixed-use ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| developed as part of the Code Update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| And in fact, if we go that route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| what we could do is take the draft we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| and give it to the consultant that will be retaining it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| ask them to provide comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| incorporate it in their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| It may not be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Either or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Or is it two things in parallel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| The...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Somewhat in parallel, we would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| If the council directs us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| to go with a revision to C-3 and C-6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| we would work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Just put the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Some of what we've done so far on the shelf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| and hand it to the consultant and ask them to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| And make revisions as they seem appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| And Gerald, they're coming on board soon, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| That's a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| And I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Vice Mayor, the AIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| the Agenda Information Sheet is being filled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| so we anticipate that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| going to council with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| and bringing it to the union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Sometime in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| so absolutely first of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| we've been able to get the contract worked through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| after holidays and start us getting all...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| And I knew we were negotiating a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| with a consultant, but I didn't know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| At MPC, we often know what's on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| when we go to the agenda review meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| And so I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| knowing where the contract...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| We have been committing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| and identified the top consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| and intervened in negotiations with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| So we will be moving in the first of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| if we get underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| And it's easier to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| That C3 and C6 may be easier to administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| than the more complex that we're going to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| We think it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2012)|
| 0:33:40| Whatever we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| we continue to meet with the Bearden community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| And if we go that C3-C6 route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| because we won't be able to meet all those goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| in the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| What are the more important goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| What are those important recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| that they want to ensure carried forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| with whatever we do in the interim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Continue to draft an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| based on input from City Council and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Present the draft ordinance to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| MPC, and City Council for review and adopted action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| and work with the developing community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| in the implementation of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| So now I'm ready for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| And again, I think our key...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| One of our key issues here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| what direction does Council lead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| And the community want us to get...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| to do that complex ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| a new mixed-use ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| or do we try a softer route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| of the C3 and C6 amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| and a overlay district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| that would address the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| put in place the standards for redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| along the Bearden...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| in the Bearden community first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| and communities and corridors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| Council, I think what's happened is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| that if you've been reading this all along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| in terms of working with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| to see what they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| and see what Mike has pulled together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| that the mixed-use ordinance is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| I think it is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| and it's one that we do need for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| What's happened is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| and just like, for some portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I used the sign ordinance as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| You know, it took three and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| to finally get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| But what's happened is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| in really what MPC has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| in looking at a mixed-use ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| there's a lot of really detailed information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| You know, when I first asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| for something like this to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| my main objective was to get housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| And how could that be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Could that be done with a mixed-use ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| or was there some other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| So what's happened is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| the concern that I have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| how long will it take really to get the mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| and, of course, what's happened is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| we're bringing on a set of consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| who work with zoning and know about zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| where we can go ahead and continue to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| and do or look towards having a mixed-use ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| But at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| what can we do in order to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| and get housing in the Bearden area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| It doesn't mean that the Bearden village plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| at some point in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| would not be, you know, turned over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| in terms of that particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| would be a mixed-use area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| But in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| what can happen is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| we can go ahead and get housing done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| by using the C-3, C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| You're saying that's a better route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| I'm saying it's a quicker route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| And it's a route that I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| both Peter and Gerald and I have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| to some extent in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| still having certain constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| that would tie in with the Bearden village plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| the goals that those folks have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| What happens now if someone comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| with a mixed-use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| and nothing's in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Can they not do that on a use-only view or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| Or is that totally barred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| under the system we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| The C-3 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| allows residential...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| approved by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| as a special exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| We've had, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| I don't know what year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| but some years back had a request for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| and it was approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| We have a request for that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| We've got spear plates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Baptist church redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| There are no design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| and development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| within that provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| so that would be something that we could work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| with the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| if the council directs us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| to review the C-3 and C-6 districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| and revise those to accommodate mixed-use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| we would want development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| because we don't want a repeat of some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| we've had in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| with certain developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| where there's a difference of opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| with the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| and then the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| did not impose standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| that met the intent of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| What are we doing in South Knoxville on the border?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| That's a separate district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| That's the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| That's its own district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| That and Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| have their own districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| which are form-based districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| and downtown is our most intense mixed-use district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| That's a C-2 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| that allows those opt...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| that makes their uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| and they have the downtown design review standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| which address design in the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Well, you asked the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| which way do we want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| and, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| that depends on the other question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| which is what's most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| and where do we want to end up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| If it's quick residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| I hear him saying the C-3, C-6 route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| gets you closer to the finish line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| because it's more of a rifle shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| and the other plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| the mixed-use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| is sort of the whole enchilada| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| under one roof, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| but what's the most crucial piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| or pieces that we're aiming at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Is it walkability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Is it where the parking is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| in relationship to the buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Is it the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| that you can have commercial office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| and residential on one parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| What do you see as the thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| that's most pressing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Doesn't that help us answer the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| C-3, C-6 or the whole enchilada?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| Well, I guess...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Is this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Speak loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Well, I guess in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| I think the issue...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Gerald, is the issue that it's been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| It's going to take a lot more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| to do the mixed-use district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| and then we're going to hire consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| to do the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Is that part of the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| That's part of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| that the consultant could pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| what we've done so far with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| and complete it while we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| the C-3 and C-6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| if we can get that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| I guess...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Let me answer that question, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| and Peter can elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| One of the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| with adding an additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| more complicated district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| is we already have Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| We already have South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| They require significant staff time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| and so I think the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| or the option is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| let's try to make C-3, C-6 as good as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| and then let the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| really tackle the more complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| land-use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| I know from a staff perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| from building inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| adding another district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| that has a very complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| administrative review is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| I think we can get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| but we'd rather get there...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Too much manpower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Peter can talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| The reviews for foreign-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| in South Waterfront and Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| have significant labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| for the staff throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| and so that's not necessarily a bad thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| but we want to go and address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| more comprehensively through the consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| and see if there's a way to streamline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| some of those administrative processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| So let's maximize what we can now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| with C-3, C-6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| while at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| there's this parallel long-term approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| with the consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| which again, the first of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| we're going to have on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| but that's an 18-24-month process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| to really do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| And Peter can elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| That is one of the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| It's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| You seem to drift towards C-3, C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Peter, do you want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| If you'll come up and talk to us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| I'll speak to you from the practical side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| Don't be real, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Well, I'm managing the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| that will administer this new set of rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| and we had talked about it with Gerald and Duane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| and what's the mixed-use district right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| as it's presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| it's all-encompassing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| but it doesn't necessarily mesh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| It doesn't go along with any of the other districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| so it's an entirely new set of rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| that need to be learned and implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| But at the same time, by the time that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| we've already got consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| who are going to be re-evaluating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| So the lifespan of a mixed-use district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| if we went forward with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| would be relatively short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| A lot of effort to learn something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| that might change in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| And I think, as we talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| we stepped back and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| what are the goals that we're trying to accomplish here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| And on the one hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| we want to introduce residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| into these commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| and I think we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| through the use-on-review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| which allows for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| It's nothing that people can slide in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| but it's out there in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| And then the other goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| of providing a more pedestrian-friendly area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| I think that, as we discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| we realized, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| this might be a great opportunity to do an overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| because overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| you can restrict development in certain ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| and that's really what we would need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| You mean a mixed-use overlay on an existing C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| It wouldn't necessarily be called mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| because the use is already determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| by the base zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| but if we want to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| a more pedestrian-friendly district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| it's more of a Bearden overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| which promotes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| and really requires that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| And it really begins to achieve the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| of the Bearden plan, but soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| In 25 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| You can add one more week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| That helps us decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| My goal is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| as the whole zoning code is evaluated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| we can integrate these different districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| and not that they all have to have the same requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| but we can have a standardized way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| of evaluating that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| as opposed to having...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| That you rebuild up by gradually doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| under the C3, C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| We'd have that use-on-review experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| The difference with the use-on-review is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| I'll speak to an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| that I haven't talked to anyone about yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| The use-on-review is all MPC staff review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| So that's an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| for all the design-related districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| that may come from the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| The administration of those shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| from Peter's office to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| where the staff already has the skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| and the capability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| And that may be something...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| So it'd be something that council should consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| and we'll certainly look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| as we go through the ordinance update and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| So how long would you say realistic, real time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| How long is it going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| to finish this H.U.S.E. plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| and get it where all the people reviewed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| and it's voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Is that a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Is that realistically a year anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| I'm looking at Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| It's his work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| And the challenge is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| And the unknown in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| is not how long it will take us to complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| It's how long does it take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| to go through the review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| to ensure that we've answered the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| that we have, the questions and the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| that the pond gap community have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| the questions that the deer community has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| to ensure that we're meeting the purposes of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| It could easily take a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| A good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| It's going to take...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| We're in the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| It's going to be eight to 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| if we wanted to go with a more elaborate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| But we also ran into...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| When we started getting down into the weeds on the overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| we ran into a lot of complications there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| I've been a big fan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| of trying to create the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| That's kind of where this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| But we ran into a lot of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| when we got down into the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| It's going to take some time also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| There were a lot of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Can you have larger signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| That's where the things start overlapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| And we started creating...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| We started making sausage with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| I mean, it's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| it's just really messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| We'll get Tim Hill to submit something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| This whole thing started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| with people...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| A developer wanted to do residential in Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| And there's a really simple way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| It's just saying in C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| either as a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| or use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| you can do residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| Is it that simple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| It's a one-year career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| as a planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| Because it has no standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| When the architect is sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| in his office with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| working on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| they don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| what their guidelines are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| When we as staff review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| we don't know what the guidelines are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| When MPC reviews it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| the community doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| When MPC reviews it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| they have no guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| We've got to have standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| I would recommend standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| with that use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| What about just as a permitted use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Then there would be no standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| But no review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| We're just talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| That means if you wanted to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| housing in a commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| you could put housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| in a commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| That's a very quick fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| and would be very efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| It would meet the goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| of mixing the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| It would meet that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| But you're saying it might be K.I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| because there's no standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| It's also going to be K.I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| because your standards may change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| with this overhaul of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| Somebody could build a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| based on the standards today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| but in two years it may change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| That would be grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| So what? You'd have a white elephant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| You may make the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| where they have to build it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| right up against the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| but you may change it in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| The developers have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| the confidence that the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| is going to stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| If they're going to be adhered to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| the people behind them are going to have to adhere to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Don't you already have those in here somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| You have some standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| You could import those over to the other...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| I think Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| is correct. We don't have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| Although I'm pretty assured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| that the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| that the consultant would come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| would be very similar to these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| I can't be 100% sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| that they would be exactly the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| and we wouldn't have a different standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Right. But if we're going with the C3 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| there's no standards now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| for retail or gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| I mean, they're all permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Look at the list of permitted uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| under C3. There's a ton of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| But it does not permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| And so you could just add in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| housing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| I think developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| hesitant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| put out... I mean, it would be risky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| in some ways, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| there's no standard...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I guess there's height limits and setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| and all that. That would still apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| They'd still have to meet the building standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| for... I don't think they'll start putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| trailers. They couldn't put trailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| and things like that on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| It would make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| But if you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| a quick fix, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| in a couple of years when we do the whole...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| when the whole code is looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| then those things would be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| more holistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| So we have a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| of outsiders come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| and they know more what we want than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| they're going to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| They've already...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| The consultant that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| was with whom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| we're negotiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| the contract now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| reviewed all the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| they're discussing pretty much all the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| that have been done for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| They drove around Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| just before their initial...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| They take a very real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| interest in the community in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| they're working and get to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| what the goals and aims of the community are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| So it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| someone who comes in and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| throws something down without getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| to know the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| So do you subscribe to the notion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| it's important to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| some residential in the Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| plan, the Bearden overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| the Bearden C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| What do you see as the short-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| goal that you're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| fill? That's what you'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| name because I look at the Bearden...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| To be honest, I look at the Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| plan and see all those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| and so what I'm asking you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| is what is your most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| goal or issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| Is it permitting the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| within that corridor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| If that's your primary goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| then that's easy if you want to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| where people feel comfortable walking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| recommendations of the Bearden Village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| plan are being implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| and that's a proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| But it can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| No, it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| It just takes a lot more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| and work and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| meeting all those goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| and one of the goals was to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| standards and that puts a burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| on the plans review staff because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| they've got to learn a new approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| and have new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| plans to review that aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| standards that aren't consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| the two form districts they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| And there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| continuity between those earlier form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| districts in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| same kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| of standards or approaches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| They're very...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| Let Mike answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| mixed use district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| foundation with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Cumberland Avenue form code. It shares a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| of the basic standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| It's the approach of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| you apply those standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| to an individual property that differs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| quite a bit. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| standards that you build to are fairly similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| it's just the way you get to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| is a lot different. Cumberland Avenue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| very easy. It's a very small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Very defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| corridor. Cumberland Avenue, you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| you can get white. You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| design a code to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| very simply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Kingston Pike is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| a whole different animal from one end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| to the other. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| hard to make a code for Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| the same thing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| portions of Homburg and the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| So the challenge is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| creating a code that's flexible enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| adapt to an individual property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| without having to create a specific district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| for that one property. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| basically what this code does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| it takes components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| and individualizes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| and then as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| you apply the zoning you kind of connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| those pieces together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| But how do you know? Your question, you started out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| with the notion that how does a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| or builder know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| he can do? What are the limits on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| parcel? And you're saying you've got a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| series of menu items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| How do you know which one fits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| The zoning district has applied to your property. It tells you what you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| two or three components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| You mentioned boiling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| down to three. You get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| one of those three and then it has its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| some new standards came into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| because this is talking about a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| bigger district and some more complexity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| so there was some standards added to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| the Cumberland Avenue code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| that just wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| necessary there. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| that's where some additional standards came into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| The piece you've chosen you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| is a reasonably ideal one to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| focus on or is that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| what was defined earlier in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| plan? That's what was defined earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| in the plan. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| there some other chunk that would make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| more sense? In other words do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| start the process and learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| from it before you leap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| with both feet into the pit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| There could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| an interest in Hamburg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Western Plazas. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| two smaller areas could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| be a place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| I'm thinking of Marshall's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| Could you have a mini| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| approach to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| parcels where you learn as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| go and you start developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| more sea lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3292)|

| 0:54:58| I think a better approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| more incremental approach would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| be the C3 and C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| provisions with some type of overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| as opposed to trying to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| in your approach we would develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| fairly complex standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| for a small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3316)|

| 0:55:35| your question yet, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| We'll move into public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3337)|

| 0:55:43| For public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| there will be five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3345)|

| 0:55:49| who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| Will will pass the microphone around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| so that people don't have to come up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3355)|

| 0:56:05| You'll state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3367)|

| 0:56:27| What business is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Control Center Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| I strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| I wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| we had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| picture of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| If you see Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| we mentioned Victor Ashe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| It looks like back in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| annexation days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| why he goes down Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| no one knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| I've asked Gerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| he said well it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| back in this 2001| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| it doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| it just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| Excuse me, I'm not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| not a public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| a real problem with this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| you all ask about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| what's a real problem, what's a real goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| here. I have a feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| it's a very small group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| along with NBC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| that is pushing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| They don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| have a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3457)|

| 0:59:57| I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| they come to restaurant retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| if they see other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| in there. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3603)|

| 1:00:07| to be in the back. As I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| it they tried to get the Mexican restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| tried to impose that on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| they fought it and didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| and it was because they wanted people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| to see there were people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| in their restaurant eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| One other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| I think you kind of mentioned it. There's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| an administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| ruling on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| If you have a question it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| an appointed administrator from the NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| not elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| and I just don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| And as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| property business owner on Southern Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3653)|

| 1:00:57| on the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3657)|

| 1:01:03| unless I lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| in my business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| or I guess I could register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| at my business possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| but then lose representation in my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| so I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| a real problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| not once has anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| concerned themselves with current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| property owners and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| have representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| and I am concerned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| you've got a small group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| activists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| without ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| in with the NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| so we roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3697)|

| 1:01:41| and they probably have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| so you go to the NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3703)|

| 1:03:39| optional. If a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| comes to our neighborhood and wants to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| that enhances their characteristics we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| quite interested in it and we'll work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| I don't think the developers should be penalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| if this plan is in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3829)|

| 1:03:57| with a number of developers. Mr. Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3837)|

| 1:04:13| El Charro. They came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| at the beginning. They loved our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| and we welcomed them with open arms. It's a shame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| we had to fight to get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| to come in but we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| go over some bumps which looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| we've succeeded and we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| forward to their opening. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| this plan should be definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| something that's optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| I think we also have to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| the fact of letting the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| the various neighborhoods in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| work with the developers, the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| real estate people and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| to make the communities really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| and work. Like I said, don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| hamstring the wonderful people. We need jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| and so forth. They need to work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| We like the businesses, restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| coming in. In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| let's just don't mess up what we've got going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| here. The ideas I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| are well-intentioned and everything but let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| make it an option for the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| to use. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3903)|

| 1:05:25| One of my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| is since I've been following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| up on this thing and got involved in this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| this is supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| a bringing us up to modern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| standards and I want to know where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| are these successful cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| and we should be rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| the success on the results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| and not the intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| So I've been doing some research. Buckhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| down in Atlanta has been mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| several times as a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Looking at Buckhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| it was built by a business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| About| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| 10 years ago, the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Commission came in, pushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Buckhead and forced development onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Buckhead in the fight of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| business community. That developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| left $350 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| on a note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| and it shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| Another developer came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| recently in Buckhead and was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| finishing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| It took 10 years before it got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| completed up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| Now that developer back in November of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| had $17 million worth of labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| liens against him. He's had several of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| his tenants pull out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| and his multi-use housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| only has about 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| For years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| developers have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| investing their own funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| taking their own risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| They study the market. They build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| what the market is demanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| and they meet the market demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Like David said, we need to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| forward. We need to make these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| changes so developers can develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| The developers need to be able to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| the decision based on market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| demand and not sit on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| vacant lot for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| waiting for the demand to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| Some of the other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| I've looked at is within this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4031)|

| 1:07:25| It's a facility where food or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| beverage is produced for wholesale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4047)|

| 1:07:41| We have a number of restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| that are baking their own breads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4063)|

| 1:07:55| These are some of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| One of the other issues is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| businesses are permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4079)|

| 1:08:37| An artist can have a retail store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4117)|

| 1:09:03| use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| These are problems that we have a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| When you mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| use on review, you've got to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| as a landlord, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| people come in wanting to rent a space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| and then when he has to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| through a four month process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4157)|

| 1:09:21| before he can get approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| he will more than likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| move to another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| These are things you need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| Businesses sometimes try to move in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| but they're restricted through the long process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| of going through these. Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| I thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4175)|

| 1:09:47| CTV and I hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| to have to leave, but it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4191)|

| 1:09:57| There you are, Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Alright, I'll make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| quick. Parker Bartholomew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| 311 South Wise, Garber Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| Just real quick on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| I think the addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| of residential to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| commercial is a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| especially in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| I do think there's already a process in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| It's not a process that's utilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| but there is a process in place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| I think a bigger issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| wanting to drastically change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| And when I mean drastically change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| I went through and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| 282 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| If you would give me a little leeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| plus or minus, but I'm pretty sure there's 282| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| parcels that are going to be modified here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| And of those 282 parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| there's only 38 that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| have no conflicts with the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| If you add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| the parcels that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| one conflict, that's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| 28. So you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| at almost 75%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| of the parcels in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| that will be made existing, non-conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| with the passage of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| ordinance as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| These things include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| ceiling heights on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| first floor. These are items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| cannot be modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| easily at all, if modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| at all, without tearing down the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| or ripping the roof off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| You're moving the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| from the back of the parcel to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| front of the parcel. These are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| small changes that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| major modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| to how we build buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| and where we put them on the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| And I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| really encourage that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| in this area that is one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| successful areas of NAWSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| some of the highest rents, some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| newest development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| that's happening in these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| to come in and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| the building location on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| the lot or the building style that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| done is really going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| hurt this area. It's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| hurt the existing owners, whether they be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| owners or developers or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| private individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| There's no doubt that it will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| Can it be limited through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| grandfathering? Yes, it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| There's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| enough grandfathering in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| I was just going through the new one. It looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| like there's no grandfathering for the base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| dimensional standards, which would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| where the building is located on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| the property. There's grandfathering allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| for frontage requirements, but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| base dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| I would just encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| this. I think it needs a lot more study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| it to be an option for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| to do, but in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| for that to happen, the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| or the owners are either going to have to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| as owners or the developers are going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| assemble parcels in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| build these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| When you start looking at how you're going to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| this standard to existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| I'm not going to say in all cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| but in most cases, the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| buildings will have to come down and we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| to start over. Maybe that's the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| but when you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| you're reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| a property to land value. You're pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| much saying the building that's on it is worthless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| and you have to be able to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| the property for land value to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| up in the air with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| this needs a lot more study and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| need to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| what we're trying to do to some existing parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| Are there some that it will work on easily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| Yes. Are there some that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| almost impossible? Yeah, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| there's many more that will be almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| impossible than will be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| I've done a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| spreadsheet, kind of how I did on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| parking that goes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| and lists by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| frontage type and building type, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| be more than happy to send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Thank you, Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Yeah, I'd like to see a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| Can I ask, why does the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| have to come down? I didn't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| It's Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Yes, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| in the redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| because where the building is located on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| parcel, you can't use it there because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| have to move the building closer to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| So, what do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| use, like if you increase the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| by 50% or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| you have to start over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Well, that's not the way it's written currently in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| I think that that's what we're pushing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| is that if additions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| renovations are done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| meet the 50% criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| then the building wouldn't have to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| But, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| well, any of the bank buildings, that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| parking in front of the building where there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| three or more rows of parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| assuming that it's designated as parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| then you could keep the building there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| but most of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| you're going to have to move the building forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| and so the existing building will either have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| be added onto and try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| put the parking behind it, or you'd have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| to remove the building. So, when you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| about this changing the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| footprint, you're really looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| at a property for land value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| because you can't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| If you can't use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| existing building, you can't count that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| in the prices you're going to pay for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| At least I understand what he's talking about, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| I thought there was a 50% rule on maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| bringing the... You want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| You want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| In other words, if you change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| or add to the existing structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| and spend more than 50% of its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| value, then you're under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| the new rule for the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| as opposed to the addition. How does it work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Well, there's a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| So, it kind of depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| on what the zone is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| that's being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| If there's a frontage type attached to it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| If there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| frontage type attached, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| the part of the code that makes a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| where the code wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| the building to be close to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| If there's no frontage type attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| then there's no... The code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| is agnostic about where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| to put the building on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| So, any additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| or any new buildings, you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| put it within your setback requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| and just like you do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| it wouldn't be much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| When do you turn the building down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| I hope you wouldn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| There's a lot of options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| in the code in regards to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| You can put the building to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| You can go up. You can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| He says you can't go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| He says you can't go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| because the ceiling height is limited there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| and you have a code standard that says...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| I think with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I imagine what's being referred to there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| is that there is a ceiling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| or floor ceiling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| or floor height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| I think it's floor ceiling height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| is the way it's worked right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| So, if you put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| an addition on the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| that would have to comply with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| The addition would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| It's existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| You could add a wing or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| As long as you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| changing the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| Say your building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| is not compliant for some standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| You don't make it less compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| then you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| I'm having a hard time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| understanding how this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| going to affect everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| to the extent that Parker was trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| The argument was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| that you're reducing the valuable property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| that has a building on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| to basically the earth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| of the square footage of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| and the building is something to tear down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| and surplus it and you have economic waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| That was the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| I was trying to figure out if it's right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| I think there's a lot of gray area in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| and you might have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| very specific conditions for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| Someone might have a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| But hopefully that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| a far minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| A lot of pain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| to trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| to make sure the code does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| affect the existing structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| I'm hoping that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| Let's be one more person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| Let's worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Tim Hill. State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4713)|

| 1:18:39| I'm not here necessarily to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| dissuade or persuade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| but to offer some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| our knowledge as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| you guys go forward and try to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| this thing out because I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| an awful lot of perplexed faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| on this council right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| This is a pretty complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| ordinance and that doesn't mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| that it can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| But I think it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| you all have at least identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| maybe different ways of accomplishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| all that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| accomplished. There's a simpler path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| I have suggested to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Gerald that maybe if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| go for the whole enchilada| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| that we do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| first in a very limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| rollout like Western| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Plaza. We know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| that Western Plaza wants to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| We know that Humber wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| to have mixed use and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| maybe we can kind of contain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| new ordinance in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| two pockets to see how it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| and if it works well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| then let's go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| continue to roll it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| Stick it to it. Yeah, yeah. We don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| to dive in head first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| right now. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| spent tens of hours on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| this thing and I will tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| you we're trying to keep up with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| parking ordinance, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| mixed use ordinance. Here there's a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| landscape ordinance, a new zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| and we're trying to puzzle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| these together which is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| difficult to keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| But in that process and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| multiple meetings with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| MPC and discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| with council, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| we do see some conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| between the ordinances which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| is probably not that uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| We have to get ironed out and we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| we see that when we bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| in Peter and he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| identified some conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| between the ordinances. So I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| saying let's be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| those to make sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| think one is okay and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| apply the other ordinance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| we see we have a bigger consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| There are things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| unsexy in some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| ordinances that you may not even pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| attention to but have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| great consequences to redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| And I'll just give you one little example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| Gerald and I have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| much conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| perimeter landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| There are so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| odd and small parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| If you apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| I think he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| looking at possibly revising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| the parking ordinance to take out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| the perimeter landscaping which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| I think is great and I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| do need front landscaping like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| you have proposed and I think you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| just going to modify that some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| maybe reduce it a little because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| of these small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| That will keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| that will stagnate redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| That one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| right there, the perimeter landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| will cause someone like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| the audio video place in Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| that I've referred to more than once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| from becoming a nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| bump cake because it could no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| apply. My parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| it appears that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| we're not going to have perimeter landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| I think in this ordinance we still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| perimeter landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| What I'm saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| my reason for being here is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| to raise awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| and questions so that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| all can ask those questions and work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| the ordinance as we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| to do and it is quite a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| but Bearden is a great place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| and we're all for mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| but I think we need to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| in a careful way. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Gerald do you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| Just to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| I think we need to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| Gerald some direction in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| where he's headed. They're presently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| working on the mixed use ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| but we have the other opportunity where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| we can do an overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| on the Bearden area in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| take care of the C3 C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| right Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| One of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| I would like to see is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| do allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| the residential aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| which may be through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| looking at the C3 C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| and doing some type of overlay with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| constraints to it and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Gerald working, just as you said, working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| with Bearden folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| what kind of restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| I guess we shouldn't call it restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| but what kind of elements ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| added to it to make sure that it happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| and follows the goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| How do you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| about the idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| a sample plot, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| Western Plaza, whatever Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Homburg or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| to see what you're running into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| or do we already know that from complimenting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| That's what I'm trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| I think we already know that. I think what we need to do is just go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| and if we're going to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| which is the C3 and C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| follows, just go ahead and have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| have the overlay built on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| on that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| Any C3 or any C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| out there? Or just in Bearden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| I'm talking about just in Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| to do an overlay and then use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| as a test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| And then you've got to opt in and opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| That's pretty important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| that some people didn't want that overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| and that's kind of where we got to when we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| finding that. Well I think that's one of the things we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| when we do the once again go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| through the community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| The main thing we want to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| we want to see about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| we know how long or we know it's going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| a considerable amount of time to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| ordinance done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| I think the thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| that we're looking at how can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| go ahead and speed up the process to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| residential in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| Maybe Gerald that's something that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| really take a harder look at and get back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| and let us know which is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| It seemed like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| administration wanted us to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| to C3, C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| What is your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| Neither route is easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| And I say that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| if we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| if we allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| C3 and C6 to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| residential with no standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| we allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| residential in C3 and C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| and have a beautiful building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| that's set back 40 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| from the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| or we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| the auto zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| then it becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| a critical issue becomes that overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| how do we put standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| do we put it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| I think it's not as simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| as just if we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| standard for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| development then we have to put those standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| in the overlay so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Mr. Hill if he wants to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| or Millport Properties at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Washington Plaza they have some guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| so that they don't come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| something that we may not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| It's probably faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| but it still takes more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| fortunately to take the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| that Mike has done and put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| in the standards for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| Wouldn't that make it the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| I don't see the difference between the overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| It becomes quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| and it's not an administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| issue for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| Peter and his staff. But if there's a standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| wouldn't there be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| use of review are reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| by our staff and I will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| time on our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| to review those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| and it may not be as complex as Mike had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| At this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| when I first started reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| the first thing we did was look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| the existing zones and determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| whether or not it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| how feasible it is, what's going to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| with trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| residential in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| existing zones and then also trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| to meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| intent of the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| opportunity plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| and every zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| has a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| standard to it so C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| and C6 are very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| zones so when you try to marry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| the two together with an overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| you have standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| that don't match so you actually have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| an overlay district that essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| throws out any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| basic district standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| What if it was just C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| That's fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| it's just those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| that are C6 that want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| to be C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| The question I'm hearing from the audience is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| how do we encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| creative use and redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| without hamstringing it so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| that people say screw it, I'm not going to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| and it's too hard to put up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| I mean is there a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| to encourage this so called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| modern enlightened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| mixed use activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| without making it a torture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| chamber and I don't know the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| to that from what I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| We certainly want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| good design and some standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| as opposed to just wild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| west build what you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| but how do we do that in a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| doesn't hamstring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| reasonable development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| I don't know how we get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| I'm scratching for that answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I think the approach is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| a word that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| L defined reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| We have to go through the standards that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| What is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| do we think would be reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| we go the over lay route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| do some review standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| then we sit down with people like Mr. Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| and the Biltmore properties group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| do these standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| appear reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| then we go to the broader community and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| it's a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| of sitting down and going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| if it counts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| what did you say George| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| know about applying all these really strict standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| I don't think you're really ready for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| I think it's going to have to be left up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| a lot of it's going to be left up to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| It's the way it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| You can allow mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| but you start redefining it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| I think it would be good to hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| at least hear from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| what they're thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| small and specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| incremental approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| like the 282 properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| that's just too long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| If council will allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| even though we're theoretically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| finished the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| there's a couple of other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| that would like to say a few words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| Is that okay with council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| Sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5413)|

| 1:30:19| Ms. Faulkner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| If you'll state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5421)|

| 1:30:39| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| you're all familiar with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Bearden Council and that we've been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| since 2001 but some of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| may not know that we've worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| with over 30 developers and 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| and successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| to get them to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| entrance sidewalks from the main thoroughfares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| into their business etc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| I'm just so optimistic about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| working with businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| and developers that want to be in Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| because I think they're coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| because of the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| and the public transit and things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| we've already done so I'm really optimistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| the type of developers that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| attracted. What I'm concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| is that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| do this long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| thing with the consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| we have a limited amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| property for infill at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| and developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| have successfully worked with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| older 1920s buildings in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| area and have really done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| a good job with that and they're attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| the C3 and I hope Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Blattner will agree with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| modify with standards the C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| we can get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| done quicker and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| we can have it applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| more quickly for developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| it is intimidating and we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| save the resources that we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| for that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| potentially serve the medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| thank you and I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| I forgot to sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| did Jim say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| you can go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| and see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| you might be talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| in terms of certain standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| put on the C3 and C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| we'd like to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| I think that also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| part of what's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| as we go through the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| codes and things like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| there is a process we go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| and I think sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| the work that's been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| to put the mixed use together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| is valid, it's good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| and it can still be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| and we find out that once we get into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| once we get into it, as one of you said earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| once we get into the weeds we find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| it's not as simple as what we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| some things are, but I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| that there is a way in which we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| go ahead and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| taken care of, especially in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| Bearden area as far as residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| and those particular areas and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| make it easy for the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| to be able to monitor and oversee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| what goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| why can't we get a pad of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| to partly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| what Marshall said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5609)|

| 1:33:33| residential can be added in C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| as long as it follows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| the accompanying standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| and then in 2 or 3 pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| list the standards or ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| or requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| and put illustrations if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| but let's not make a 40 page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| or 50 page tome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| let's make a 3 or 4 page document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| that's understandable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| but then you can layer on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| definitions and stuff later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| that's the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| this is what we'd like you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| and if you do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| follow these standards and we'll bless it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5645)|

| 1:34:37| but he was on the front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| we had 4 on the rear of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| so if in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| it would be helpful if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| could avoid a BZA night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| I know you guys usually do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| on Thursday nights but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| I think particularly when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| have a meeting as important as this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| and obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| BZA's are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| important to neighborhoods too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| so I'll put that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| are you speaking to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| subject tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| I am going to speak to the subject tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| but you've got the preamble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| ok| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I'll make it short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| again I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| the council understands that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| agree with the comments that you've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| about making it simpler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| that's good for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| we are in favor of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| obviously as Tara has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| we are not in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| of the car sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| for automobiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| and we've made this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| every time we've had a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| we've voiced that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| seen the latest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| the car lots, no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| continues to be in the revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| I haven't seen the 10-3 revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| hasn't been on the internet very long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| and I didn't do due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| to go up and get a copy of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| so maybe it's gone now I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| but we are opposed to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| and that's pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| pretty much what we've got to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| I think everything else from what I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| sounds like it's been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| to some degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| ok thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| council thank you meeting is adjourned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877161117?start=5783)|
