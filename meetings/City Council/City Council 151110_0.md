| 0:09:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| I guess Joe Walsh, I don't know where, is Joe here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| Joe was supposed to be here and I'm not sure what's happened so I'll try to answer your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| questions if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Well, I do think it's the smallest dollar amount on the agenda tonight, but I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| we have a fleet of buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| I guess the question I have is why not use the CAT buses and drivers we have and Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| and I talked briefly this afternoon about that, but I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Use the CAT buses for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Well, our funding doesn't allow us to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| Yeah, our funding is designated for fixed route transit and this would be for special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| events, things that you do with the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| It's a different kind of bus that's used and it's also a different kind of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| So, and I'm sure after the, certainly after the Knox County School bus wreck last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| and all that happened with that, I guess assure me and assure us that there are safeguards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| in place for licensing and insurance and drug testing and texting while driving and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| the things that went wrong in that wreck that were protected on that, in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| Yeah, the contract, and Charles can probably talk to this too, the contract requires that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| MACE goes through extensive review of their staff and employees who are driving these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| buses and then make sure that they have all of their licensing in order as well as insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| And I'm sure we check on that or I don't know, I just, I mean that was a big deal then and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| it seemed pretty obvious that in that very unfortunate situation and I just, I assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| In the law department when we have requirements like that, we always require before the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| is actually signed, we have to get certificates sent in to us and proof of what we require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| that shows that they've done what's required in the contract and we do that before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| contract gets signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Well, I'll actually attach it as exhibits to the contract after we get all that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| in, but there is more scrutiny, I'm certain, after the accident last year, so we're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| careful to make sure that we have all that information in our files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| But cab buses can't be used for anything but fixed routes, is that, that's what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| saying on, so you can't use them, they can't use cab buses for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Cab bus funding is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Private charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Cab bus funding is for fixed route transit services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| And just, there's a, there are a limited number of hours, I think 80 hours a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| 82 hours a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| that we can actually use it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Other than fixed route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Other events, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| I didn't know, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Jim, do you have some more information on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| Just for clarification, this would also be prohibited under the regs which require you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=754)|
| 0:12:43| if there is a bus line or whatever, to do it, you can't take away from private bus lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| and that's one of the provisions on charter buses for CAT and that's something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| adhere to very strongly because that's something that you will really get dinged on if you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| if you try and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Excuse me, there's been discussion about seatbelts on buses and I'm wondering if the Mays bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| line has seatbelts, do they have to use seatbelts, and if we as a city wanted to require seatbelt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=791)|
| 0:13:21| usage, what would be the steps to go about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| Well, there are no seatbelts on the Mays bus lines because they're not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| I'll defer to Charles if he wants to address whether we're going to require seatbelts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| That's not a requirement that was put out in the contract, so if that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| you felt like you had to have, we would have to just not do this contract and put out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| new contract and frankly, to find a bus provider, a charter bus provider who provides seatbelts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=826)|
| 0:13:55| I don't know about the availability of that, but we could do that if you just want to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| down the contract altogether and start all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| I don't want to do that, but I'm really asking for information purposes because it's a safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| issue, so thank you for the information, appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=857)|

| 0:14:23| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement between the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=863)|

| 0:14:40| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=881)|

| 0:14:48| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| I'm sorry, did you have your line on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| No, no, I was just wondering, it said that it was an important year, just to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| a rundown of the timeline of what's going to be happening and the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| For the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Yeah, I can give you some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| DSM is who we relied on last time when we did an evaluation of our waste services and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| right now this is a contract we've gone through, a process where they submitted based on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| RFP, our evaluation committee met, they determined that DSM is the proper vendor to provide this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| So if you guys approve that tonight, we'll go ahead and enter into a contract and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| contract will probably, they're going to be getting quite a bit of information over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| next 60 days and then they'll do a process where they evaluate that information and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| provide us some additional information on other services that are available out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| I don't have a definite timeline on when we're going to get that, but obviously our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| bid year is 2016, so we're going to do that just as soon as we can and get all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| And they will actually assist us in helping to write the RFP for the actual services as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| So this is just a step to write the RFP, which will be sometime in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Yeah, I mean, obviously our goal would be that we take all of our waste and turn it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| into energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| I don't know that we can get there, but we're going to do absolutely everything we can to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| try to minimize the cost and do what we can to achieve some goals like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| And they're going to help guide us is the best way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| And then so maybe this time next year we'd be looking at the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Yeah, hopefully before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| I think it'll be before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| I want to say it's sometime after our first fiscal year, sometime after July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Oh, we already did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Sorry, we already approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=990)|

| 0:16:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| 12A is an ordinance to amend Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| zoning regulations regarding pet services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| I wanted to talk for just a moment about how this kind of started, give a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| I was contacted by a gentleman who was a part of my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| or at least he wanted to open something in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| He wanted to open a small business and deal with pet grooming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| which at the time seemed like a pretty good idea, and I tried to help this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| But it has sort of ballooned to where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| And it's been to MPC twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| It's been before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| And at this point, I'm ready to see it put to bed, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| But well-groomed, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Councilman Dallaropi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Well, as Dan said, we've danced around this, and so has MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| It seems like there are two objections, and I think we have someone signed up to speak about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| but they seem very practical, and I'm not sure why they didn't get tucked in when they were down at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| One is the time of day of such activity, especially when you're in neighborhood areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| and when these facilities can be opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| The suggestion was made, and it was even in an MPC draft over a year ago, in March, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1110)|
| 0:18:38| that we have specific time of day limits for the hours of service, something like 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| They had written it in terms of first 24 hours, then 18 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| but the problem, as pointed out in the materials we have with a number of hours kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| is if you bring your pet in at dawn, your 18 hours ends, you know, 9 o'clock or something, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| If you bring your pet in at noon, it probably runs over to the next morning, and you can't follow or enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| So just a regular time of day service thing, and we have someone has given us an addition to the definitions by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1151)|
| 0:19:20| that would say the operation of a pet grooming service shall be restricted to the hours between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1160)|
| 0:19:28| That could be a different set of hours, but a specific time frame so that a code enforcement official could look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| The same would be true of pet daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| The other objection may take some further scrutiny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| but it has to do with whether or not it should be allowed in a specific zone that is neighborhood commercial or C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1183)|
| 0:19:52| and the argument has been made at least that C1 is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| typically small neighborhood areas in older neighborhoods that have some, what, businesses that serve the immediate community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1199)|
| 0:20:09| and they thought that the people that objected to this, that pet services or grooming, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1209)|
| 0:20:18| or daycare might be, I don't know, too traffic intensive, too out of keeping with that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| So the suggestion has been made that the zone C1 be excluded as one of the places where such services could be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1225)|
| 0:20:35| An analogy was made that traditional neighborhood zone, which is very much similar to C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1235)|
| 0:20:45| does not have this allowed and C1 should be treated the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| But those are the two main objections that come to the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| There was a third aspect, and I believe MPC touched the base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| And the question was, should they require soundproofing and air conditioning in such facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| so animals don't end up getting stressed or the neighbors get stressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| And I think they may have taken care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| But those are the three things that have come to the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| It would be my suggestion that this council adopt such of those changes we think is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| and then send it back to MPC to ruminate further if they have to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| or maybe they've already considered that, I don't know, and rejected it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| but that we actually take an action and not just keep batting the ball back and forth because it's getting tiresome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| Are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| I would propose them an amendment, but maybe we want to discuss exactly what should be done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Well, Nick, I'd say I think the hours, specific hours, I think is a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1305)|
| 0:21:53| More enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| I would say, I would argue, present that C-1 probably is a pretty good zone for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| When you think about it, it's not laughable, but it's probably not a lot different than a beauty salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| It's not a lot different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| It is local services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| The landlord, to whether if the landlord puts that tenant in there and runs off other tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| and that's his problem, and he's got more of a, so he's got to balance it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| and if you're going to put it in a shopping center, he's got to balance it with his other tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| The comment was not his tenants versus other tenants, but the nearby residential users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| And this is day services, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| It's not kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| It's not overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| It's not intended to be overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| It's day services only, not unlike a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| They have time to drop them off and try to pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| And if they're left overnight, well, then that, again, that becomes the owner's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| No difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| So I would think that C-1 is the, probably is, I think, in a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| this is where those services are needed and wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| And the people that I've talked to downtown are very enthusiastic about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| And I would think in small neighborhoods, in a small shopping center, it very well might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| And that may be so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Those are the main concerns that have been raised, and they're pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| I mean, they are pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| They're pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| And then the other, as far as making other requirements, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| I think the landlord is going to get into that issue, whether it's compatible with his other tenants or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1395)|
| 0:23:23| Vice Mayor Powles, I'll get to you in a minute, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Would it have to go back to MPC if we moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| I didn't think it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| They had the comments, so I guess they considered them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Yeah, I mean, we could amend it or pass it or not, but I don't think it has to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| I would have to know whether or not MPC considered a time of day type limitation to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| That would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| It was debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| It was in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Gerald Green, director of MPC, they discussed it, and their approach to it was limiting it to 18 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| And, actually, I came in not even in the middle of this, on the tail end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| From an enforcement standpoint, having times of day for limiting it to times of day would be much more enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| than saying 18 hours because we have no idea when they opened and when they were closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| But for time of day, it would be easier from an enforcement standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| So I would concur with Councilman Pavlis on having times of day for the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| So long as the record reflects, as you say it does, that this is something that was considered at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| it doesn't have to go back to MPC unless you want it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Are you finished, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Okay, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| When this came before us some years ago, Mr. Brown, it was initially going to be for a downtown ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1483)|
| 0:24:51| a central business district ordinance, and now it has blossomed to the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| or at least that world within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| So I agree with Councilman DeLaValle that it is not appropriate for C-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| and I would take it a step further and just limit it to C-2, which is the central business district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1505)|
| 0:25:13| That would seem to be an area where there's a big need for pet daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1513)|
| 0:25:21| I'm assuming, and I don't know, are we limiting this to dogs, or could I bring my pet python to daycare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1521)|
| 0:25:29| It says household pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| I know, and my pet python might be a household pet in my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| I'd like to see that pet python.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| She's got it right under the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| It's right down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| And then we're going to call on former Councilwoman Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| So I said something this afternoon to Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| I was concerned the way this thing has come to us with a 7-6 vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| which is not a resounding decision one way or the other, and I appreciate the work they've done on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| but apparently, and you might want to speak to this, Gerald, the commission, your commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| may have been either not clear or confused or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| I read the transcript two or three times, and I could not figure out where all the trouble was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| and why we can't get this thing straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| It's not that hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| I tend to agree with Councilwoman Palmer that this really started as a downtown project and central business district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1581)|
| 0:26:31| So how did this move on to C-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| He wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| Well, Ms. Malone gave the correct answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| I wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| But I think this is an indication of the challenge with our current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| Our current ordinance is somewhat dated, and it does not address some of the issues that come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| So the MPC staff hears a request, whether it's from council or from a business person or a resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| wanting to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| We try to address that specific thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| but then say where else could this use or this activity occur, and then try to broaden it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1627)|
| 0:27:16| And in that attempt, we often don't look as comprehensively as we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| at the implications of that use in various districts, the standards that should be placed on that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| and how it interrelates with the other standards in our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| And I think this is a case in point where the request came for a specific area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| the staff looked at it and said this use may be appropriate in other districts within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| Without the input of various neighborhoods and organizations and business people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| what the impacts or the attributes of that use should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| And that's how it ballooned from just one district to a broader perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Mrs. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road in Knoxville, Tennessee, on behalf of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| And I feel like I've been here since the dawn of time with pet services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| I'm sure you're tired of hearing about it, and I'm tired of talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| Two things are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| One is if this city wants to continue distinguishing between 24-hour boarding facilities for pets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1700)|
| 0:28:29| versus a daycare or grooming, you've got to change the language that is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| Because the language before you, the 18 hours, applies to how long an owner leaves an animal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| An owner leaves an animal for no more than 18 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| I can leave them, as Nick Dellivope, he said, for my 18, you leave them for yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| and you've got a 24-7 operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| The other thing is the C1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| And let's talk about C1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| C1 district is not downtown, and they are usually not shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| C1 districts are usually standalone buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| Look at Washington Pike on small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| I don't worry about C2 zone, where you have multi-tenant buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| or shopping centers where you have someone who's concerned about other tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| and the financial bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| I worry about the Washington Pikes and the Fountain Cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| where you have a C1 on a small lot, maybe not a well-cared-for building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| And frankly, the absentee owner doesn't give a flip how much nuisance there is to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| because the neighbors are residential and they're not paying his bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| That's why C1, and there are very few left in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| that's why C1 has got to be seriously considered as a zone that demands review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1787)|
| 0:30:01| Now, if we want all commercial zones to have all uses, let's just have a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| We can put everything in it, from kennels to restaurants to daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| And yet, there are barbershops in C1, but most of the clients don't bark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1814)|
| 0:30:23| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| There's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Most people don't drop their kid off at a barbershop for a haircut and pick him up 12 hours later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| That's what happens at grooming places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| So there are differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Dogs and pythons and birds don't use modern plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| There are a lot of differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| And if you look carefully at this, there are standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| but those standards are only for outdoor pet services, none for indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| So picture Washington Pike, picture Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| picture Lawton Fountain City in the Smithwood corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| where you have a standalone C1 building and somebody has animals there 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| doesn't require air conditioning, doesn't require soundproofing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| It's what we want and what we think will make our city stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| I would suggest what Councilman Della Vopi is proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| and believe me, we haven't talked about limiting it to C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| Again, because they're multi-family, multi-tenant buildings, I have no problems with C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| The landlord or the condo association will make sure nothing injurious happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| C1s are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| I would suggest that what Councilman Della Vopi is suggesting is change the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| Believe me, MPC has heard all of this before to the point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| I'd almost be afraid to show up again when pet services was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| I think Mr. Green would agree with that, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Mayor, I'd like to move that we amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Put your mic down so everybody can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Yes, Mayor, I'd like to move that we amend the language of the ordinance change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| to add to the definitions of both pet grooming and pet daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| They are set out in the text that we add a sentence at the end that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| the operation of a pet grooming service shall be restricted to the hours between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1959)|
| 0:32:47| and that we do the same thing for the pet daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| The operation of a pet daycare facility shall be restricted to the hours between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| I'll make that first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| And then we'll take the other item up separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| Okay, so that's the first amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Time of day, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| You think 10 p.m. is like, I mean, that's really late to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| It might better be 9, but I just, whatever you, I'd amend it to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| There's some night dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| 10 p.m. is late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| I'm just saying 10 p.m. is late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| You want to get their hair cut before they go to the club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| Would you suggest 9 or 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| 8 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| That's 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| That's 14 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| That's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| I'll entertain a friendly amendment if you want to change that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| That accommodates the broadest range of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| If you do that, you start waking up the neighbors to get your dog out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| That's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| So we're keeping it 6 a.m. to 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| That's what he's proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| Would you be okay with 9 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| I'll amend it for 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I'll accept your friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| So we're just incorporating that for both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Same language, just the second hour is 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| The 9 p.m. for both of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| That first one passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| And the second amendment would be to, if you look at, let's see, page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| it looks like 267 on your packet and, yeah, I think it's 268,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2077)|
| 0:34:46| to remove the item that says C1 Neighborhood Commercial District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| from the proposed districts for permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| So we would just exclude that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| You'd be left with C2, C3, and then on the next page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| the special commercial units of SC1, PC1, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| They would stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| We would just excise C1 from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Okay, removing C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| I guess I sort of agree with Mr. Wallace on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| I sort of thought C1 might be an appropriate zone for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| Mr. Green, what went into the decision for allowing the pet grooming in C1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2129)|
| 0:35:40| I was on the tail end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| So to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Some of it, the thinking was that this type of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| especially since in the C1 it was limited to pet grooming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| that pet grooming may be an appropriate use in the C1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| picking up on what Councilman Wallace said, that it was low impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| would provide an opportunity for those residents in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| to have a nearby business at which they could have their pets groomed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| and, again, limiting it only to pet grooming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| If someone has an example of a nuisance pet grooming operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| to me it seemed like a pretty low impact use that would be okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| and it would be a place you might want to walk your dog to in your neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| to have it groomed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| I think there's one close to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| It's actually in a C3 zone, but it could be a C1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| It's in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| But anyway, that's my reservations with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Okay, so there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Was there a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| So we're voting on whether or not to remove C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| The amendment is to remove C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| I'm sorry, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| I thought I wouldn't be alone on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| I'm the only real animal in the bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| So C1 is now removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| We've amended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| I think they have taken care of the question of soundproofing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| and air conditioning in the language they used in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| and I think that's no longer a contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| indoor pet services and veterinary establishments provided all animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| shall be kept inside soundproof, air-conditioned buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| It says that on page 267.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| They did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Ms. Malone, just wait a minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| Maybe I'm misreading it, but I read that as saying that that's a required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| The proviso says provided that they shall be kept inside soundproof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| air-conditioned buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| I'd like to recognize Ms. Malone to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| We had this discussion at MPC as we parsed the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2292)|
| 0:38:20| What that says in C3 is indoor pet services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| and the air conditioning and soundproofing is only for veterinary part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| indoor pet services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| The semicolon story, that's right, in the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| I would move that we remove the semicolon and make that a comma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| That's a motion for, let's see, the item number 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| the use that's described as indoor pet services and veterinary establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| The punctuation caused some people to wonder whether that applied only to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| veterinary or applied to both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| so we should just take the semicolon out and end the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| It's a grammatical motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| So the motion is to remove the semicolon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| That may be one of our first times we've had that kind of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| I think we've had a full colon, but never a semicolon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Okay, everybody knows what we're removing there, the reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Did we get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| The semicolon is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| So now, so any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| No, I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Good, we're working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| We're getting things done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Okay, so now we have to go back to the original motion as we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| Had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| We never had an original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| So now I'm moving that we approve as amended, but twice amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| Okay, so I need a motion to approve as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| I'm so moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| As amended three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| We're just testing you there, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| Okay, everybody ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| We're voting on the whole shebang now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| That is approved as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2409)|
| 0:40:21| 12B is an ordinance to close a portion of Simmons Road from Lexington Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2421)|

| 0:41:34| I think we have someone signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| Would you like to hear from him first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| Yes, I'll just make a brief statement, shorter than him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| this is the one we postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| and allowed both the neighbors and the developer to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| and work it out, and they have done so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| and we'll hear from Mr. Chady there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2511)|

| 0:41:58| Marcus Chady, 2841 Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| As you remember from our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| we requested a postponement so that we could work with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| We've been here, MPC, back and forth several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| The result of our negotiations was the developer on October 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| executing restrictive covenants associated with development of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| That executed document appears in your agenda packet three times, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| but associated with rezoning, pages 371 through 374.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| I'd like to thank the developer for working with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| I'd also like to thank my neighbors who are here, many of them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| We went through lengthy negotiations to come up with a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| that was amenable for all parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| and the patience of council in allowing us to do that is very much appreciated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| Mr. Green came in, as you have on several issues, a little bit late in the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| got up to speed very quickly and was very helpful in this process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| He and I have discussed the fact that when development plans are submitted for this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| that his staff will be reviewing those development plans for compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| with these restrictive covenants which were executed, again, on October 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| And that's accurate, correct, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| Is there anything that you need to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| If there are any variations from those standards as set forth in that agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| the staff will note them and will notify the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| and the developer of those concerns, and we will work with you to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| And again, thank you to council for allowing us the opportunity to work really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| as neighborhoods and developers should work together to reach an amenable solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| which we have indeed done in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Thank you, Mr. Cheney, and thank you to all the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Mayor, I have one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| I'm going to move first that we amend this, maybe not the sector plan, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2653)|
| 0:44:21| but all three of them, really, to allow them to be done on one reading as an emergency reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| rather than returning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=2667)|

| 0:51:27| a standard knitting mill building, and certainly here again we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=3087)|

| 0:51:47| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| I assume from reading this that we're going to protect or continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| build out the greenway, but I'm not sure specifically if it's mentioned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=3113)|

| 0:52:13| is prepared by the developer or owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| It would come before the MPC staff for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| We would coordinate with other city staff to assure the greenway and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151110?start=3140)|
