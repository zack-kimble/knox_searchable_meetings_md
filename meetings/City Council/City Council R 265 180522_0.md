| 0:01:08| who are hungry today. Grant us the wisdom to make decisions that benefit all our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| neighbors and the strength to make them. We ask that you watch over our police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| and firefighters as they protect us and we give thanks for the sacrifices of so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| many in their service to all of us. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=81)|

| 0:02:04| agreement from you. We have for the issue on the budget 9A there are four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| people who signed up to speak for it and four who signed up to speak against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| and so I guess if there's no objection we will hear from each of them. Is that fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| with council? Okay. And we're cutting off the signups at this time. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| Typically you sign up before the meeting starts. So does council agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| Yeah. Okay there's no objection to that. So we have four people who will speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| for it and four against it. Also just to let you know similarly with public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| there are five people who've signed up for public forum that's with that's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| issue with the council rule so that will come later at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=169)|

| 0:03:08| items to be withdrawn? Items for postponement? Mayor. Councilman Roberto. Yes item 9AA. I got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=188)|
| 0:03:19| message that the rezoning at Knott Road that property is no longer under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| contract and so they wish to for that to be removed. Okay so there is a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=202)|

| 0:04:12| want to acknowledge that this is National Public Works Week which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| celebrated by every year by the American Public Works Association to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| the contribution of public works departments employees across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| We have five departments that we cluster together under public works and they all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| provide very vital services. That would be engineering, fleet services, parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| recreation, plans review and inspections, and public service. Between them these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| departments have about 520 employees which is a third of our city workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| They are some of our most dedicated workers but also often our least visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| because so much of what they do is behind the scenes. So David Grace has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| overseen all of these departments for several years first as our senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| director of public works and now as COO and deputy to the mayor. So I want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| David if you'd like to say a few words about our public works employees. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| thank you much mayor and City Council. So yes this is public works week and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| is the week where we recognize the 520 men and women who provide those core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| services every day to our citizens. Again public works at the city is fleet, public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| service, parks and rec, engineering and building inspections. These departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| comprise over a hundred million dollars in budget allocations annually. I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| like to include our partners at the Knoxville Utility Board. If you think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| KUB and their 900 employees and the services they provide they're also part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| of public works. So what is public works? Public works truly is a core function of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| our local governments. In addition to public safety we have police and fire in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| the back. Public works is that third branch of government that really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| focused on public health and safety from providing clean water to disposing of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| solid waste to building roads and bridges or planning for and implementing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| mass transit to removing snow on roadways or devising emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| management strategies to meet natural or man-made disasters. Public works services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| determine our quality of life here in Knoxville. This year's national theme is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| the power of public works and it really honors the vital contribution of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| works professionals that they make every day in our communities throughout North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| America. And so we invite the public and members of council if you can just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| recognize our public service, engineering, parks and rec, fleet and building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| inspection employees as you see them out and about. I always appreciate council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| members during the invocation. They always recognize police, fire and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| works during their invocation. So big thanks to those folks. They had a cookout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| today and yesterday and are out doing their work, oftentimes unseen. So thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| you. Thank you David. I think we all join with you in thanking them and recognizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| for the great work that they do. And throughout the week we'll be highlighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| the work of these departments, these employees on the city blog on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| at knoxvilletn.gov. So please take a look at that. So this week we'll be cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| two ribbons in the Old City. First, the historic staircase that connects the Gay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| Street Viaduct with Jackson Avenue, with Jackson Avenue below, will be officially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| reopened on Wednesday, May 23rd at 4 p.m. That's tomorrow at 4 p.m. We'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| celebrating the new staircase lighting and the beautiful mural commissioned by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| the Central Business Improvement District and created by Robin Easter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| Design. It's the latest in a series of public art installments throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| downtown. So it's a great time to gather with members of the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| Public Arts Committee and the city's Public Arts Partners to take stock of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| our growing collection of new murals and sculptures. Again, that is at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| tomorrow, Wednesday, May 23rd at Jackson Avenue Terminal, which is at 213 West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| Jackson Avenue. Afterward, the Old City Association will meet and we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| hosting a cookout, so come on down. So that's tomorrow. So then the next morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| on Thursday, May 24th at 1030 a.m., we'll celebrate the completion of two West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| Jackson Avenue streetscapes projects. The upgraded utilities, sidewalks, street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| lighting, and landscaping represent a more than $2 million city investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| That ribbon-cutting will take place on the south sidewalk near the Daniel at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| 118 West Jackson Avenue. And so that is Thursday. Also, I want to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=508)|
| 0:08:38| everyone that city offices will be closed next Monday, May 28th, for Memorial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| Day. Trash and recycling pickup will continue as usual that day, so be sure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| pick them, to put them out if you have regular Monday collection. And I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| everyone really enjoys their holiday weekend. Finally, as I announced at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| State of the City address, we will have a public meeting to discuss plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| potential for the new Urban Wilderness Gateway Park on Saturday, June 2nd, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| 2 to 4 p.m. at the end of James White Parkway, where it stubs out. We'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| the meeting there on site so everyone can really see and experience the area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| we're talking about. I have proposed, pending Council's approval tonight, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| $10 million investment to create a new park there that will be an entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| significant entrance, to the urban wilderness. So now we are seeking public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| input about the design and amenities there, and this is a chance to get in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| the ground and look at the possibilities. Parking will be available at South Duel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| Middle School with trail access to the event. Parking with direct access will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| also be provided at the end of James White Parkway. Again, that meeting is from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| 2 to 4 p.m. on Saturday, June 2nd, so two Saturdays from now. Hope to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| everybody there. Finally, I understand that there are two birthdays to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| I understand Stephanie Welch had a birthday a few days ago. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| And Savannah, is this your birthday today? Happy birthday to everyone. That is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| end of my report. Any Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| Councilwoman Singh-Perez. Hi. I just wanted to talk about a parade that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| happening this weekend. It seems like a lot of fun. It's called the Appalachian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Puppet Pageant, a giant puppet community arts parade. It is on Saturday morning at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| 12 o'clock. The info on it, it's free and open to everyone. The theme is Our Roots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| Our Power. We invite you to make giant puppets, masks, costumes, flags, puppets on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| bikes, or any other people-powered creations. So it sounds like a lot of fun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| and it's on my birthday. Oh, happy birthday to you, too. A lot of birthdays here. A lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| May babies. Councilwoman Welch. Yes. I just wanted to remind everyone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| Cumberland Avenue is open for business and there's no better time than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| summer to visit Cumberland Avenue. There's a little bit less traffic, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| all the businesses and restaurants are open and welcoming. It's a beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| redesign with the Cumberland Avenue corridor and it's even more beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| after the Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association this morning launched their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| CAMA CARES campaign. That's C-A-M-A CARES. The Cumberland Avenue Merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| Association is getting businesses along Cumberland Avenue to pledge to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| five to ten minutes every day cleaning up trash. I was out there this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| picked up a lot of cigarette butts, and unfortunately, but I think that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| help from the community and business partners and certainly the support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=714)|

| 0:13:58| either side to speak. First, I want to call on Vice Mayor Saunders and then is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| your line on, Councilwoman, or not? Yeah, I don't know if I want to, is it, can I speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| before and? Yeah, you can speak, yeah, before and after, sure. Vice Mayor Saunders. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| Mayor. I just wanted to thank my colleagues for our extensive and, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| thought, the best review of the budget that I have been involved in in my seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| years on this body. Last Thursday, we had an all-day session from 830 in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| morning until 430 in the afternoon and then public comment at five, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| thought it went very well. I really appreciate my colleagues and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| questions they asked. We were very engaged. I do think listening to all of that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| we heard all day long, it couldn't help but impress me with the enormity of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| the city is involved in. It's an enormous amount of activity that we provide in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| service to the citizens of Knoxville. I hope that as we consider the budget, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| think that what has been presented and what we heard well represents what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| city is about and I think it has been presented in a manner that uses the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| resources the most efficient way possible. I hope we will consider adopting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| this budget. Thank you, sir. Councilwoman Singh-Perez. I have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| questions, but I think I'll wait after the speakers speak to begin asking them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| but I do want to say it's amazing to see so many people here and I know a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| people came out here to get involved with the budget hearings and that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| it really takes is citizen participation, so thank you. Thank you. Okay, we'll begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| with the speakers. First, we go with the four people signed up to speak in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| of the budget as presented. The first is Anne O'Connor. So, O'Connor, please come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| forward and state your name and address for the record and you have up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| minutes and I'll set the timer. I'll give you an indication when you're a minute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| I'm Anne O'Connor and I live at 1214 Lakeland Drive in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| I'm here tonight to speak in support of the 2.5 million dollars that Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| Rojero has put in the city budget for the Affordable Rental Development Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| Tonight, I represent Justice Knox. We are a collaboration of more than 20 diverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| faith congregations all over the city of Knoxville. Altogether, we represent 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=982)|
| 0:16:30| citizens in our community and a small delegation has joined me tonight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| they'll stand up just for a second so you know who they are. In our first two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| years of working together, members of Justice Knox have taken the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| time to listen to each other. In 2015, we had 39 house meetings. In 2016, we had 65| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1005)|
| 0:16:55| house meetings. Hundreds of people from our congregations came together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| gathered stories about what keeps us up at night and also what makes us angry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| about our community. And over and over again, people told stories about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| themselves, about loved ones, about neighbors and friends who could not find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| decent affordable housing. There were stories of children who had graduated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| from college but could not afford housing in Knoxville. Stories of elderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| people living on fixed incomes who could not find rentals that they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| afford. Stories of people working full-time but spending so much on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| rent that when unexpected expenses arose, they got behind and were evicted. With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| these stories in mind, 250 leaders from our congregations gathered last November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| and voted to choose this problem as one to do research and to take action to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| solve. And in our research, we discovered that this housing problem is much worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| than we had even imagined. When we met with the City Development Office, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| called the problem a crisis. We agree that the housing problem in Knoxville is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| absolutely a crisis. Thirty percent of Knoxville families and 25 percent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| Knox County families cannot afford their housing. For many of these families, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| situation is desperate. 21,000 low to moderate income families in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| including more than 14,000 families in the city of Knoxville, pay more than half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| of their income for housing costs. These families are spending so much of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| income on housing that they have to make difficult decisions every month about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| which bills to pay and which bills not to pay. Decisions on whether to pay rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| to buy food, or to buy medicine. No wonder there were 4.7, almost 5, families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| evicted every single day in Knoxville in 2016. Our city lacks decent, affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1142)|
| 0:19:11| housing and is losing it rapidly. The City Development Office told us that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| rent a two-bedroom apartment in Knoxville, you need to make $17 to $18 an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| hour. We know that many of our workforce make much less than that. We heard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| long waiting lists for public housing. We heard about hundreds of families with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| vouchers to rent housing, but they don't have it, there's no housing available for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| them. We heard that there were 1,500 families on a waiting list just to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| for those vouchers. Volunteer Ministry Center told us that when people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| struggling to pay their rent and utilities, they can't counsel people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| find something in their price range like they used to do. You have one minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| ma'am. Because there is no housing in their price range. Everybody deserves a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| decent place to live. I think we would all agree on that. When people have stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| housing, they're healthier, they keep their jobs, their children do better in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| school. Adequate, affordable housing in our city will make Knoxville more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| prosperous and a stronger community. We know it's going to take a long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| sustained effort to solve this housing crisis. Again, we support the mayor. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| support the mayor's $2.5 million budget allocation. And along with the $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| in last year's budget toward affordable rental development, this is an important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| beginning to addressing this problem. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| Thank you, ma'am. Next, we have Keith Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1242)|
| 0:21:04| State your name and address for the record and thank you for being here. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| set the timer for you. Keith Lyon with the Knoxville Police Department and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| president of the local chapter of Fraternal Order of Police and I am a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| resident of Knoxville. We'd like to come out in support of the mayor's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| 3% pay raise for the members of the Knoxville Police Department and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| government employees. The best way I can illustrate this is to give you what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| does, the cost to live in Knoxville, Tennessee, and how much the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| living has gone up. In our vending machines outside of here, Cokes are now $1.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| Just eight years ago, they were $1.10. Just eight years ago, peanut butter was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| $2.00 in the stores. Now it's $5.00. Eight years ago, $20.00 would have fed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| four people at McDonald's. It doesn't do that today. It barely feeds two. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| price of Little League baseball used to be $60.00. Now it's over $100.00. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| price of football is over $200.00 now if your child plays. Minor trips to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| doctor, $60.00 to $80.00. That's why this pay raise is important to us. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| Knoxville gets in return is a department with a nationwide reputation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| training just by training itself. Not many departments in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| require police officers to train a full year before they hit the streets by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| themselves. An officer can get trained here, and just because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| certificate that says Knoxville Police Department, he can get a job at just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| about any agency in the country and some places abroad. Other agencies come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| our department to see how we handle things like some of the demonstrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| that have occurred this past year in Knoxville. We've managed to work those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| without injuries to officers and participants. That makes an impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| nationwide. Responsibilities have increased exponentially since 9-11, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| recently there's been an emphasis on mental health. This year, every officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| in the Knoxville Police Department is undergoing mental health training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| called CIT. And why we're doing that is to police the mental health community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| and help protect those and keep them safe. In the dozen plus critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| incidents that involved people of mental health in crisis this past year, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| were all resolved without injury to the officer and to the subject. That's quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| an accomplishment. Knoxville gets premium quality police service. And also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1407)|
| 0:23:35| with that in mind, with our headquarters, with the issue of the headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| coming up, we need new facilities to keep going with that mission. Our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| facility has been around 50 years, and we've exceeded our limits with that. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| renting out other spaces, and it also would help put this in a community where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| we can build partnerships and collaborate with the community. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Knoxville Police Department's training academy was in the Mechanicsville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| from 1989 to about 2014. During that time, I was a staff officer at the academy, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| it was great to go outside, and you're basically making friends with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| community. The Boys and Girls Club was there in the same building. We built a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| lot of relationships with them. The location would serve that purpose on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| old Knoxville College complex. We support the mayor's proposal, and we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| that you vote yes. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next up is Kevin Faddis. Please state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1466)|
| 0:24:41| your name and address for the record, and thank you. You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| Thank you. Good to be here. My name is Kevin Faddis. I'm an assistant chief with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| the Knoxville Fire Department. I'm also the president of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| Firefighters Association, 614 North Central Street, and tonight I'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| speaking for the budget, to approve the budget. I speak for behalf of over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| 90% of our firefighters in endorsing this. First, I'd like to start out with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| thank you, everyone. Can I mention this? We just had a firefighter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| appreciation day, and I want to mention that, because you guys were involved as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| well as the community. I hope they came out and enjoyed it as much as we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| We're looking forward to the continued support of that in the future, and very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| glad that our association could be a part of that. Also, like I said, we are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| favor of the $40 million newly constructed building that would house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| the fire department and the police department administrative offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| possibly some training areas as well. An area that is jointly used with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1542)|
| 0:25:51| equal space and owned, not leased, is our firefighter, not firefighter, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| administrative offices are currently leased at this time, and EMS office. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| we would certainly own that. We need to streamline this building for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| safety sector of our city so they can do the day-to-day business, some training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| in-house, other administrative offices, cross-train with the police, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| right there beside each other. I mean, fire and police work hand-in-hand, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| does public works. But we certainly do that, and it would be an honor to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| them with us, because I'm sure they'd love to have us there, too. We cook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| better anyway. Also, we also recommend, and we're in support of the 3% raise. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1593)|
| 0:26:45| mean, I can't tell you, like Officer Lyons stated, that helps out tremendously. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| mean, every little bit counts. So our association, our members are certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| grateful, and we look forward to, in order to keep building up, to get in line with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| our counterparts as well. So this isn't a done deal. So we appreciate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| counsel, for always listening to us. Whether it's right or wrong, whether you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| agree or disagree, it's good to be able to come to the table and talk openly. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| with that, I recommend, and I hope you all pass this budget. I think it's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| good budget. I think you all work very, very hard on it. And with that, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| association would certainly like to see you pass this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you, sir. Now, Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1648)|
| 0:27:41| Thank you for being here, and please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| and I'll set the timer. I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| My name is Mark Taylor. My address is 2706 Alice Bell Road, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| Tennessee, in the 4th District. And I'm here to speak in favor of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1671)|
| 0:28:00| And I'll give you a little bit of background. I'm the immediate past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| president of the Fraternal Order of Police. I've recently changed positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| there. So I've been to this podium many times speaking about public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1688)|
| 0:28:16| I recently, a couple of years ago, bought a house in the 4th District that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| didn't have floor coverings, that didn't have appliances, and that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| stickers that were vacant and no trespassing and this and that over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| And I crafted a plan to make that house a good, safe place for me and my son to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1713)|
| 0:28:42| live. He's a college student over at UT. And so that's a process, and I consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| the city sort of like that house. I like to think of the city as my little house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| on Alice Bell. The first thing I looked at and my realtor looked at was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| foundation of that house. And I've looked at a couple where the foundation was all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| askew. Public safety, police, and fire are the foundation of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| Everything that you're building and everything that's great about Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| is built on the fact that it's safe for our citizens to be here. Without that, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| lot of that goes away. So I love the stuff that council's done over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| six, eight years that I've got involved and paid attention to these issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| the development and the urban wilderness and the zoo and all of these things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| we're investing in to provide quality of life for our citizens. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| good. I'm happy to pay my taxes and do that. But remember the foundation. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| currently at about high 370s to mid 370s officers. Our allotment are 416. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1798)|
| 0:30:09| having a lot of trouble getting new people to come here and getting people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| stay. That is something that we've got to look at and address. The pay raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1814)|
| 0:30:23| that's proposed is modest given the conditions. If you look at it from a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| perspective, if labor is not plentiful, then rates go up. That's kind of how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1828)|
| 0:30:40| The headquarters that we have was built in 1969 or thereabouts. During that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| the internet hadn't even been invented. Most families didn't own a computer until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| years and years after that in their home. So imagine sticking internet and computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1855)|
| 0:31:03| in that building and trying to make that stuff work or even air conditioning if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| section it off. We had to evict the fire department over 24 years ago. Our fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| department headquarters basically squatters at the end of the day. I think it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| good to have a modern facility like the other investments that we have in the city that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| reflect our commitment to public safety or commitment to quality of life for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1886)|
| 0:31:34| I think those go hand in hand. There's no separation in that. So I'd like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| I think that could be a good thing. I think that the cooperation between the police and fire...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| You have one minute. One minute, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| I think the cooperation for the police and fire are good. But just like the walls in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| safety building, it's limited by design, by barriers that are either physical or removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| geographically. So our guys do hard jobs every day. They've been doing them under hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| conditions and they've been working a lot of extra hours trying to make up the shortages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| We ask that you support this budget and support our public safety. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| Thank you, sir. Also, I would like to recognize all the police officers and the firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| who are here tonight. Thank you for being here and thank you for your service every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1948)|
| 0:32:36| Mayor O'Hara, I have an alibi. Kevin Faddis's birthday, he's going to kill me for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| but I know this was May the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| Well, happy birthday to Kevin as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Put that in there, I know it'll mean something. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| Thank you. Okay, now we have four people signed up to speak against the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| Mrs. Idil Isaac, if I pronounce that properly. Mr. Isaac, oh, Ms. Isaac, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1975)|
| 0:33:14| Thank you for being here. Please state your name and address for the record and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Thank you. My name is Idil Isaac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Sorry, Idil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| No problem. My address is 1301 Bridge Avenue, apartment 11, and the zip code is 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2003)|
| 0:33:34| I live right there at Four Standards. I'm a UT student, PhD student in the anthropology department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| Okay, so I'm against some of the items in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| So after all these positive comments about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| So my question, I have some questions about the $40 million or that's a roundup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| but the $36 million that's going to go towards the new police headquarters and Firebright headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| Now, the city has the current headquarters and that is owned by Knox City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| Does this $36 million take into account the sale of the current property that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| Ma'am, what we do here is that you just make your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| It's not a back and forth question and response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| So I'm not allowed to ask any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Right. You just make a council is who asks the questions during their dialogue after you make your statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Okay, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| With that, my primary contention with this particular item, the $36 million for the new headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2081)|
| 0:34:49| is that we don't have a definitive outline of really how much this is going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| And for the public, we haven't been provided with complete details about how much this project could cost us overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| I feel that the public needs to know that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| We need to know how much you're selling the previous property for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| and how much of that is going to be allocated towards the new facility that you're going to be building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| And if that $36 million is also going to take into account the debt that Knoxville College has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2116)|
| 0:35:25| which is here $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| So that is my primary contention with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| But I also have one other contention with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| which I am grateful that you have allocated $2.5 million to address some of the affordable housing issues that we have here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2137)|
| 0:35:48| But looking at some of the other items in the budget and the money that has been allocated to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| for example, the $10 million that you're going to be allocating for James Parkway to have this new park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| I just feel $2.5 million is lacking for such a huge issue that we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2160)|
| 0:36:08| I feel that the Knox County, I feel that Knoxville City Council can do much, much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2168)|
| 0:36:19| as far as meeting the requirements financially that we need for you to improve housing in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2179)|
| 0:36:29| For students, for poor working class people, I'm grateful that you are, of course, providing city workers with 3% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2189)|
| 0:36:37| But you do know that the medium household income for Knoxville is $34,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2197)|
| 0:36:45| That and along with the increasing cost of housing makes it very difficult for the average Knoxville citizen to be able to survive in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2205)|
| 0:36:54| So while you're raising the wages of your city workers, I'm hoping that you guys are going to work a little bit harder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| to help elevate the citizens in this city to increase our wages, increase the living wage that people are getting paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2220)|
| 0:37:11| possibly bring in better jobs to the city of Knoxville, decrease the cost of living so students are not having to pay $800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2231)|
| 0:37:21| For example...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| So that is my primary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| I just feel like I'm grateful for the 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| I feel it's not enough considering the money that's being spent on other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| And for the police headquarters, I feel that we just need to have way more information about how that money is going to be allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2255)|
| 0:37:44| No offense to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| We do appreciate what you do, but we do want to know as citizens and taxpayers what exactly is going to be used for all that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2266)|
| 0:37:57| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| The next speaker is Amelia Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2280)|
| 0:38:28| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| You have up to five minutes, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| My name is Amelia Parker, resident of Knoxville, a member of the city council movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| And I'm here to address the council at the budget hearings, but wanted to follow up with a few thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2323)|
| 0:38:53| because initial comments have been about Knoxville College, but what you all are determining tonight is strictly about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2333)|
| 0:39:02| We have time to talk about Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| And I agree with what everyone in the room has said thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I believe we should pay our public workers a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| I believe that just as Justice Knox said, that we are in a housing crisis, affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2355)|
| 0:39:23| And, you know, I agree with the most recent speaker that 2.5 is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| And when we look at how money is allocated in the budget, and when we listen to the departments who presented at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2368)|
| 0:39:39| and shared with us projects that are currently unfunded, I think we can do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| I think community development should have the $5 million plus in projects that are currently unfunded funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2385)|
| 0:39:53| We also learned that the $36 million that's been put into the budget is just a guess at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| We don't know how much it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| It seems reasonable to me that some of that money could move to community development to finish those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| Perhaps we can find even another $50,000 something to increase CAC's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| But doing so would barely put a dent in the budget, the money allotted for a new headquarters at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| So I'm coming in opposition to pieces of the budget and hoping that this city will commit to not only expanding our affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2424)|
| 0:40:37| but as we said at the budget hearing, really using this budget as our moral guide in the city and making a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2437)|
| 0:40:47| that you truly do have a commitment to every resident of this city, from those who have nothing to those who are ready to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2447)|
| 0:40:58| in all of these activities that are being prepared for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| And just one thing I wanted to say, because we keep putting public safety as this foundation, and I really have to push back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2461)|
| 0:41:11| If you look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs, that the foundation of that hierarchy are physiological needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2471)|
| 0:41:20| So if you don't have food to eat, if you don't have warmth, if you don't have shelter, you cannot think about safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| So we have to make sure that the residents in our city have food, that they have shelter, that this winter when it gets cold they have shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2488)|
| 0:41:37| that we're not reaching out to churches to see who can open the doors for a night when we have families living on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2497)|
| 0:41:46| And they need to know where they're going to go next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| They can't just wait and see if someone's going to open the doors that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| So I'm just asking for city council, it's not even a huge ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| It doesn't mess with the raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| It doesn't even prevent a new headquarters being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| But can we allocate funding to ensure the community development can do all of the projects on their table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| and to ensure that we have some emergency housing this winter so that we don't have to have our neighbors out in the streets with no shelter and no food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2532)|
| 0:42:23| That's all I'm asking tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| Is Michael Mahaffey here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Thank you, sir, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| I'm Michael Mahaffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| I live at 509 11th Street, 2006 in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| I had a really productive discussion earlier today with Councilwoman Stephanie Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| who provided due diligence in following up on a message I left her regarding concerns I had about this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| And learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| And the thing that struck me in our conversation was that although I look and I notice that you had a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| or some kind of three-day process determining this budget in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| I didn't seem like there was enough local community participation in this process that happens in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| And it's not anything new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| It's a very old habit that goes back decades in Knoxville's history of a sort of aristocratic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2609)|
| 0:43:37| top-down kind of means of making decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| And I'd like to see more due diligence on the part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| in making sure that there's more local participation in these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Now, you might have made announcements in the local press or something that this might be happening or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2631)|
| 0:44:00| And I'm worried that that is not keeping up with the times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| that people have work schedules and lives that don't necessarily match the situation that the city used to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2645)|
| 0:44:15| when it would mete out information for public discourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| So in the future, and this is for hopefully more hearings regarding where the police department will be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2660)|
| 0:44:31| and other matters, that you do more due diligence in engaging local residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| Because my impression is that there's not a lot of local support for where the police department will be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2678)|
| 0:44:47| And that's because this particular kind of community had this happen to them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2687)|
| 0:44:59| And it seems to keep happening and happening and happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| And what kind of impression do they have of the city and how the city thinks of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| especially in neighborhoods on the east side where there's large police presence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| but the roads have been really bad and have been that way for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| In fact, as far back as I can remember, and I can still drive through neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| and still have problems on those roads with potholes and just bad upkeep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| And that's the way the people see the city looking after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| So maybe we ought to look at a different kind of approach in the way we make these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2732)|
| 0:45:42| and hold these hearings and include local residents on a far greater scale than has been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2742)|
| 0:45:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| Next speaker is David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Mr. Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2758)|
| 0:46:11| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| David Hayes, 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| First, I want to say to Justice Knox folks, y'all generally love poor folks and working folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| and homeless folks in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| I love y'all, so I thank y'all for being out here and advocating for folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| even though our tactics are different today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| I also want to say shout-out to Sergeant Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| He's the guy who actually arrested me for no reason at a protest not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| I can't wait to see you in court, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| So starting off, let's just get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| So to perpetuate and continue oppression without knowing it is one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| but you all have been equipped with necessary knowledge to know that voting yes to this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| is neglecting people's needs, thus consenting to oppression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| You all know our city is in a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| You all know that thousands in Knoxville struggle to find and maintain affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| And you should know that homeless folks get mistreated and abused by KPD regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| And those folks do not have enough access to resources or the housing they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| Now, if you take there's a $2.5 million allocation for affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| but the mayor will tell you there's more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| There's KCDC. There's other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| There's a whole $10 million the city is devoting to affordable housing is what the city may say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| Now, $10 million is the same amount that they are giving to reconstruction and renovating of the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| So thousands of lives get the same investment as one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| That's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| You know that police is a quarter of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Many more times than any department dealing with any social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| You know that the police's budget, right, is 90% like at least 90% of the budget as far as that $55 or $56 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2872)|
| 0:48:00| they're getting in general fund, 95% or 90% of that's going straight to their salaries, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| So it's not going towards prevention. It's not going towards training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| It's not going to the other programs or like lotting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| Just their salaries, which you're asking for an increase for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| So y'all should know that if you had adequate social services, education, resources, and housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| then a lot of these arrests that we're seeing wouldn't even occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| Now, you know that community groups and institutions in the city under the community agency grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| that the mayor likes to lobby as like being such a great thing and save our sons and daughters under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| that whole fund just gets exactly $1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Well, not exactly, but, you know, pretty close. $1.7 million. That's it. $1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| If you can compare that to the total police budget, right, it's over $93 million. It's a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| And you all know that, you should all know that the mechanics bill community has not consented to a new police headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| I know because I went there this Saturday. We was door knocking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| Talked to over 100 people, hundreds of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| They said, yo, what you think about this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| Y'all haven't done that. How can you put something like that in a community and not even ask folks how they feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| how they'd be affected by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| And y'all know that Knoxville College has been neglected by the city for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| And y'all know that more money and resources could be going directly to Knoxville College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| without having to have a police headquarters on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| Now, we get into this concept of safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| Last year, over 200,000 calls they got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| Police should not have been the answer for those 200,000 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| What do I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| For instance, if we had adequate investment into programs and responses for addiction and mental health struggles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| adequate investment in those so we didn't have police, most, I'm not going to say all, but a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| a lot if not most of these calls we're getting with these struggles wouldn't even happen in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| if we had alternatives set in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Criminalization is not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| Okay, so you all promised on your elections, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| while you were campaigning to people saying we have your best interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| that you all promised that you would do what's best for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Passing a budget that neglects social services and prioritizes policing and criminalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| a budget that does not prioritize the needs and wants of the people, such as housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| which people are here for today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| a budget that does not let people participate in the creation of it, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| just having a couple hearings a few times a year that no one knows about is not actual genuine participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3034)|
| 0:50:42| This is a good amount of people, right, but we should have 10 times more, 100 times more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| hopefully 1,000 times more people being involved in how this city is shaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| You shouldn't have to sacrifice whatever is going on just to make the few times available just to come out and see how you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| but not actually have an input in how the budget is actually made, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| We should have that power to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| And passing a budget with no major amendments to fund social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| like community development said like 5.3 million they wish they had for other programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| Where is it at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| Don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| So to pass such a budget is not doing what's best for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| So I hope you will vote no on this budget and pass a budget that actually represents the people and does what's right for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| Okay, council, that concludes the speakers on that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| Now discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Like I said, I've got quite a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| I wanted to know the parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| What we're voting on right now are the parameters of the budget that you've proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| And what is that that we're definitely saying yes to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| What are we funding with these monies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| Like what is this first vote about specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| This is to approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| Finance director can address it if you want more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| But basically in order for us to start working on any of these projects that we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| we have to have money appropriated by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| And so this basically says these are the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Come on down, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| So we are approving these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Now, this is a general guideline on this is how we anticipate the revenues we anticipate, the expenditures we anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3143)|
| 0:52:32| But for any of the issues, the contracts, development agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| all those things that actually make that you have to do in order to build, say, a police headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| all of those come back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Any contract over $25,000 comes back to council for any event, any type of project or program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3168)|
| 0:52:57| So this is setting a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| You guys know just since you've been on council since December that every agenda is full of contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3180)|
| 0:53:09| It might be hiring a consultant to start programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| For example, that's one of the first things we'll do is hire an owner's rep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| and start the programming of a joint police and fire headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| All of that comes back item by item to council to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| Before anything is in the same with a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| If the project with Knoxville College, if that moves forward, then there will be a development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3212)|
| 0:53:39| There will be an agreement formalized with Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| So there are many different steps along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| This just says and sets an intention that we're building a police headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| It doesn't say the location in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| It doesn't require a certain location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| It just says we are building a police and fire headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| So what we're approving is garbage pickup and Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| and the things that municipalities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| We're also approving over $10 million in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| The other programs in community development, the work with, you know, every one of our city departments, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3255)|
| 0:54:25| You were funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| So what this does say is that we have X number of employees and we can move forward and continue to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| They can continue to do their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| Does this say that we are going to borrow $36 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Well, you answer that, Jim, because there's a lot of technicalities to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| What this budget proposes, now again, is the plan to issue roughly $55 million in new debt next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3288)|
| 0:54:59| to provide for several different projects, primarily the development of a new police public safety headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3299)|
| 0:55:08| But there's other things that we are planning on issuing debt for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| And, again, some of these may change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| For example, urban wilderness, other types of capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| And you can, just as a note, you can only borrow for capital type items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| You cannot borrow to pay recurring operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| That's a cardinal rule and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| What this budget does is it's kind of like the budget probably gives you the skeletal framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3334)|
| 0:55:42| and now you have to start working to put the flesh and muscle and everything else onto that skeletal framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3342)|
| 0:55:50| And, again, as the mayor noted, what will happen is most of those things will come back to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3350)|
| 0:56:00| in the form of contracts, memorandum of understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| anything dealing with property acquisition or property disposal comes back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| It has to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Now, obviously, we're not going to bring back a specific payroll to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| We'll take care of those routine kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| But all the significant items in the process comes back to council for further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3379)|
| 0:56:27| On 12A, and I'm pushing ahead a little, that's where the capital improvement ordinance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3387)|
| 0:56:37| That's where it starts talking about us taking bonds for the monies that we may borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3397)|
| 0:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| 12A is the capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| That is a six-year plan, which is somewhat different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| That kind of lays out future capital needs as well as current capital needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| As part of this item here, the budget, you are passing the first year in that capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| So this is an operating budget as well as a capital budget, but it's for one year only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3428)|
| 0:57:23| There are other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| This is difficult to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| So it is saying that part of the capital improvement for the first year is to go ahead and start with the 36 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3449)|
| 0:57:38| The first year allocates or appropriates, allows you to spend up to $36 million for a new public safety headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3458)|
| 0:57:52| Again, we've already allocated roughly $4 million, and so that's where the $4 million comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3472)|
| 0:58:01| It allocates, again, $9 million for improvements to the Coliseum Auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3481)|
| 0:58:10| We already have another million that we've previously allocated for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| That's where the $10 million comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| This is adding to those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| And, again, it allows you to spend up to that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| It won't necessarily all be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| It will not all be spent in this budget year because it takes, you know, a couple years or whatever to actually build something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3507)|
| 0:58:36| But you have to plan ahead and say we anticipate a $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| We've got $4 million, $36 million in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| And then it allows us with coming, checking back in and getting your approval along the way to start that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3522)|
| 0:58:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| Here's my hesitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| That's a great deal of money, and I want to make sure that we're involved in every single aspect of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3532)|
| 0:59:00| And it sounds like we will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| In terms of the issuance of debt, you will have probably at least, I guarantee, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| and most likely three more items will come before you before any issuance of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| And that's, again, two at a minimum and probably more than that as we work through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| So there will be lots of steps along the way as we get into this, you know, probably something in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| And then other items may not occur for a year or so as we work through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| But you will basically see all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| You're actually, at your next council meeting, there will be a third item on a debt that we're going to issue that we planned a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3579)|
| 0:59:48| So, again, these are long, long live processes, and there's lots of steps along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| So, again, you'll see at least two more steps on just that one issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| And that was approved May of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| So there are a lot of different directions this whole project can go from right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3611)|

| 1:01:58| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| I just wanted to check with David Brace again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I think that I had, last time, had some misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| This is city property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| It's not property that's owned by the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| It's a public facility on Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| Actually, Mr. Sandy Gillespie, I think, was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| So, Mr. Gillespie, the Neighborhood Group has raised, through the state and the neighborhood organization, almost $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| So, our $10,000 will match nearly $100,000 in private to actually update and upgrade a city fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3744)|
| 1:02:34| so we can put other resources in other parts of our parks and recreation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| So, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Yeah, I was under the impression it was private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| But one of the reasons I wanted to explain why I voted no was also just about a comment on the inequity that exists in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3765)|
| 1:02:54| that we don't have fountains in District 3, and we'd like to have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3788)|

| 1:03:11| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| I will add, Councilwoman, I was just at your 150-acre park out there in your district today, which is actually very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Don't forget, you do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| It's quite a nice park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Needs a fountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| Well, we can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| 9F is an ordinance to close an unnamed alley between the northeast boundary line of parcel 094NL028 and 18th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3811)|

| 1:03:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| 9G is an ordinance to rezone property from multiple zoning districts to multiple zoning districts with H1 and design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| property bounded generally by or located on East Glenwood Avenue from I-40 to Spruce Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| Washington Avenue from the Standard Knitting Mill Complex to North Chestnut Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3848)|

| 1:04:19| MPC applicant sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| I want to first call on the law director to explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| I know he sent you all an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| I did send you an e-mail last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| I think it was Thursday to all of counsel with regard to this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| I think probably most of you know, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| I think most of you are aware of the fact that Article 7, Section 6D of the code, of the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| provides that when an application for a change in a zoning classification is filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| there are 120 days from the time it's heard at MPC for it to be heard in final form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| and if it is not completed in final form at the end of that 120 days, then it fails by operation of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3903)|
| 1:05:12| And this was postponed in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| It was postponed to this date in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| At the time it was postponed, it was known at that time by those who adopted the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3920)|
| 1:05:28| that the 120 days would pass within that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| and that's why shortly after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| counsel came forward with a moratorium on demolition in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| to give the counsel an opportunity to explore various options with how to deal with the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| But having said all that, because it's been now 222 days since this was originally heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3951)|
| 1:06:00| in the Metropolitan Planning Commission at that public hearing at the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| by virtue of operation of law, this matter is dead and it is not possible for you to vote on it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3966)|
| 1:06:14| Now, it is possible for you to vote on this subject, but it will have to start all over again with the process in MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| So I don't want to say that the whole subject is precluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| I'm just saying that this particular ordinance has now failed by operation of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| And so for you to consider an expansion of the H1 in the Park City area, it's going to have to start all over again in MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=3992)|
| 1:06:41| And I think I mentioned to you in the email that I sent to you that the demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4001)|
| 1:06:50| I mean the moratorium on the demolition that was adopted earlier is about to expire next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| And so we will be coming back with an extension to that moratorium to allow for more discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| and more exploration by those in the community and you all as well to figure out what way you want to go forward with this whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4022)|
| 1:07:12| So if there are any questions, I'd be glad to entertain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Well, I didn't know if anybody else wanted to speak before me, but I do want to speak on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| I know this is a little bit delicate because it's not my district, but I'm very familiar with H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| I have been very involved in my own neighborhood and with many of the people who live in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| And right now with the economy and the market as it is, they are getting pummeled with constant daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4059)|
| 1:07:48| sometimes six letters a day from house bundlers, buyers to buy up the properties over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4068)|
| 1:07:55| And I'm not opposed to, I'm not trying to speak against house flippers in the real estate market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| I have my own involvement in that and own my own home, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| But what is happening there, and there have been similar requests in my neighborhood outside of our H1 and within our H1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4086)|
| 1:08:14| is to buy some of our smaller homes, which we were just talking, meant for quite some time tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| and quite a bit the other day at the budget hearing about low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| When you take a smaller house, a one-story house with two bedrooms and one bath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| and bump it out and expand it in multiple directions any way that you wish because there's no guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| and turn it into a three-, four-, five-bedroom house with three bathrooms and you've bought it for $50,000 or less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4117)|
| 1:08:45| and then turn around and sell it because the market will allow for $300,000, that's not helping the market, the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4125)|
| 1:08:53| It's taking the existing housing stock and changing it into something that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| It's changing the neighborhood into something that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| So I feel that this process got really unpleasant and unfortunate and went into a negative direction prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4140)|
| 1:09:10| but I don't think that we can ignore the market forces that are taking the houses and changing them over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| And they're changing them into things that people that are there and in favor of this H1 can't afford themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| and turning the houses into something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| And I've had similar requests from people in my area that they want to do the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4164)|
| 1:09:31| convert their houses and add on to them and make them into something that they aren't, triple their size by expanding out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| And H1 can address some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| And so I feel like, you know, this is gone and we can't vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| but something needs to happen moving forward because the neighborhood is getting eaten up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| So it needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| I really have more questions than a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| I'm wondering where we're at in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| Right, and I was about to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| What happens next and kind of where we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| So let me just give you an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| We also have two people that want to speak to it, but before we hear from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| I wanted to update you on our engagement with the Park Ridge community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| and our plans after speaking with these groups, with these individuals for next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| As Charles has just said, these items were postponed for six months at the council meeting on November 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| Some of you were on council then and others were elected but had not yet taken office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| Former Mayor Brown, who was the sixth district representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| had opposed the proposed expansion of the H1 because of the significant divisiveness in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| over the proposal and other issues that had been raised in the process that also needed to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| I agreed with him and encouraged council to table or postpone the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| Council voted unanimously to postpone it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| We made clear that night that the postponement had the effect of essentially denying the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| since the six-month delay pushed it past the 120-day limit for action on an item after it had been through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| That's what Charles just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| I said that my staff and I would meet with members of the community on all sides of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| to better understand the different perspectives, the various issues that had been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| and to talk more broadly about priorities in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| We have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| We have had eight meetings with different groups of neighborhood residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| Councilwoman McKenzie has been present at several of those, as many as she could when her schedule allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| and has also been meeting with neighborhood residents on her own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| During that time, Debbie Sharp and our Office of Neighborhoods also worked to help the Park Ridge Community Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| reorganize and elect a new board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| We then invited the full board in for a meeting in my office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| At that meeting, the board suggested that the next step should be a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| where we can further discuss options around historic preservation and neighborhood mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| With PCO input, we have scheduled that meeting, and some of you may be hearing this for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| for Wednesday, June 27th at 6 p.m. at the John T. O'Connor Senior Center at 611 Winona Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4324)|
| 1:12:12| and I encourage everyone who cares about the future of Park Ridge to attend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| You may also remember, as Charles just mentioned, that at that same meeting on November 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| Council enacted a moratorium on any demolitions in Park Ridge so that we wouldn't lose any housing stock there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| while we work through these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| That moratorium will expire at the end of June, so we are working with Councilwoman McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| on an extension of the moratorium to bring back to you all to give everyone some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| We'll bring that to you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| I can tell you from our conversations and the e-mails we have received, and I know you have received as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| that there are still a lot of strong feelings around these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| but we believe there are also a lot of shared priorities and values in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| so I'm hopeful that we'll be able to reach some compromises that can address those and help people work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| One thing I definitely believe in is that there are a lot of really great people who care a lot about Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| regardless of their view on the H1 expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| So that's where we are from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| Shall we hear from the two speakers now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| First is Lynn Sullivan, followed by Tanner Jessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| Thank you, Ms. Sullivan, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| I'm Lynn Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| My address is 1912 Washington Avenue in the Park Ridge neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| And even though you can't vote on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| I'm here tonight to ask City Council to help Park Ridge get the H1 zoning back on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| to protect the character and diversity of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| by protecting the worker homes that predominate the proposed H1 expansion area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| I've lived within the current Park Ridge H1 for 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| As a Ph.D. with 40 years of experience in a historic preservation field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| I understand the difficulty in getting a National Register District approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| and the case that must be made to show the significance of cultural resources at a national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| I also know that historic preservation is not about creating museums of the rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| It is about protecting places that are important to people from many walks of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| Knoxville's failure to protect the largest part of the Park City National Register District is, by default,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| preserving only the small section that includes most of the George Barber-designed houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| These Victorian houses largely were homes of upper-middle-class professionals in the late 19th century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| They did not house mill workers and other tradespeople.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| Those homes make up the majority of houses in the proposed H1 expansion area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| Ironically, opponents to the zoning expansion claim that preservation of the worker housing would harm today's workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4484)|
| 1:14:52| I served on the Board of Directors of the Park Ridge Community Organization when, after a membership vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| the request was made of then-Councilman Round to ask City Council to direct the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| to perform a feasibility study to determine whether H1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| to include the rest of the National Register District in Park Ridge, would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| This proposed extension is in City Council's 10-year plan approved in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| You all approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| The process was stopped last November by the Mayor at the last minute before the second Council vote that would have enacted the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| The Neighborhood Board was not consulted and received no communication from the City Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| that an action to stop the final vote was being initiated because of neighborhood opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| Significantly, at the annual neighborhood elections following that ill-fated Council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| the three anti-H1 PCO board candidates failed to be elected by a vote comprised of the largest turnout of my neighbors a PCO election has ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4544)|
| 1:15:56| Among issues H1 opponents failed to acknowledge is that historic preservation of architecture also is about sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4556)|
| 1:16:04| keeping houses out of landfills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| Old house construction is significantly different from new home construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| Contractors unfamiliar with older construction can and are creating damage that will either require owners to make expensive repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4572)|
| 1:16:19| or will cause actual failure of the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| For example, a home in the expansion area was renovated in preparation for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| and its craftsman-style roof brackets were removed to install new siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| Those brackets are not only integral to historic character, they also support the house's eaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| The edges of the roof will fail without these brackets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| Building code staff cannot reasonably deal with such situations with historic homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| By the time they arrive for inspections, the damage is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| The Certificate of Appropriateness process through historic zoning is the route for providing expert advice at the beginning of such a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| Since the November surprise, renovation and flipping of houses in Park Ridge has continued at an unprecedented pace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| as Councilwoman Ryder has noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| Housing prices are climbing because of market pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| Building codes are the only regulation for most of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Small houses are being transformed into quarter-million-dollar homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| Flippers want fast cash and are not using the 20% federal historic preservation tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| that could be paired with affordable housing funds from HUD to keep decent, affordable rentals in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| The historic zoning opponents are succeeding in keeping out regulation of the old homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| but this was accomplished at the expense of rapidly vanishing affordable homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| as they are snatched up by flippers, bent on a quick profit with no regard paid to either historic preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| or helping to maintain Park Ridge's stock of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| The Park City National Register District is the largest such district in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| It also happens to be on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| What seems to be happening, intentional or not, is a new form of the urban renewal that destroyed neighborhoods in the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| Again, ironically, historic preservation laws could have protected those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| I ask City Council to help Park Ridge get H-1 zoning back on track to protect the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| and diversity of our neighborhood by protecting the worker homes in the National Register District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| And my neighbor, Tanner Jessel, will discuss some legislative initiatives that could help this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| Mr. Jessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4704)|

| 1:18:40| My name is Tanner Jessel, and I have lived at 1026 Olive Street in Park Ridge for 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| Park Ridge seemed a great place to put down roots in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| I saw a neighborhood on the rise and not in decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| The neighborhood is now facing rapid change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| The time is now to protect what's left of Park City National Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| Really, the time was six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| Today marks a forced reset of a multiyear resident-led process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| I want to believe more time and discussion can unwind fears over costs and outcomes of historic overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| Experience as an educator tells me not everyone can be reached, even with careful explanations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| To paraphrase Mayor Brown's observation on outreach efforts for the overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| you could rent a plane and ride it in the sky, and there would still be people who said they didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| Park Ridge needs tangible, defined goals and help to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| Six months ago, resolution to the historic overlay issue in Park Ridge was delayed for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| Since then, there have been zero public meetings, no public solicitation of input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| no mailers, no flyers, no e-mail distribution list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| There have been closed-door, invitation-only meetings coordinated by the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| It is clear the constructive dialogue promised by Mayor Rojero to fill the six-month delay has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| The delay has not been used productively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| Set to expire on July 1st, the City Council's Emergency Demolition Moratorium, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| respectfully request the City Administration or Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| to evaluate the current proposed overlay compared with overlays adopted by other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| and to recommend how council could address and modify the proposed overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| and impact upon the people and history of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| The Metropolitan Planning Commission has not done this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| MPC's historic preservation expert was not included in invitation-only meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| the City Administration offered residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| If the City Administration has done this work, their findings have not been shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| There are solutions here that can reflect well on everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| Independently, a group of neighbors and I formed the Park City Preservation Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| to advocate for the built and cultural heritage of the area in and around Park City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| We've spent the last six months looking at other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| There are solutions that can work in Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| and we look forward to discussing those options with council members and City Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| A few examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| In Mobile, Alabama, a historic homeowner maintenance fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| set up with community development block grant funds offers up to $15,000 for roof replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| paint, windows, and exterior repairs for historic homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| In Portland, Oregon, a $300,000 accessory structure fund offers tiny homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| for women with children on the verge of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| This model could increase affordable housing density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| and save accessory structures recently noted by Knox Heritage as fragile and fading in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4900)|
| 1:21:48| In Knoxville, Tennessee, a $500,000 historic preservation fund exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| $100,000 went to one developer for the redevelopment of a commercial building in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| The building's not on the National Register of Historic Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| It was eligible for this money only because of the work of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| It was a property under consideration for H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| The heart of our view is most residents never said they don't want historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| Rather, a concern was if everyone could afford fees for a certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| or cost differences in materials that might amount to a few hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| Let me emphasize that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| The concern, the opposition stemmed from fears over costs to low-income homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| in the range of a few hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| At the same time, the city awarded $100,000 in preservation funds to one developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| and residents got nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| We agree with the city administration that preservation of our history and culture is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| We agree economic development within our older neighborhoods is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| If $100,000 were awarded to a gap fund for residents to cover cost differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| or fees tied to preservation, we might not be discussing fears linked to historic preservation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| It's not too late to adjust the city's developer-driven model for next year's fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| Appropriating even a fraction of the historic preservation fund as a direct investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| in the people of East Knoxville in the culture and history of Park City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| directly hits areas of wide agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| How many low-to-moderate-income historic homeowners might a $100,000 gap fund help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| How many $25 certificates of appropriateness or application fees could $100,000 cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| Can Knoxville help historic homeowners or is assistance only for developers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| Other municipalities have solutions that can work in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| Even our own District 6 rep, Bernie McKenzie, has said she can support historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| if assistance is in place for lower-income stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| Let's make it happen in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Mr. Jessel, would you please e-mail those recommendations, those examples you gave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| It would be my pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| Thank you, Mr. Jessel and Ms. Sullivan, for sharing your viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| And I also want to thank the members of the Park Ridge community that did take the time to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| and meet with the mayor and the administration and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| I don't want to rehash what has happened in the past, but for those who have followed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| there was a huge division in the Park Ridge community as relates to this particular item of the H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5060)|
| 1:24:28| And, Mr. Jessel, you are absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| I am not opposed to H1 overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| I do think that they have a place in preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| I was not in favor of this particular one because of the massive expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| and the number of homes that it would cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| I'm sure homeowners in Park Ridge are receiving letters of people wanting to flip houses on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| and we talk about urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| We also have to talk about gentrification as a huge concern in the Park Ridge community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| And so you have offered some very good options to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| and I do look forward to talking with you and coming out and learning more about some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5105)|
| 1:25:13| In some of those meetings, there were some recommendations that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| that I thought were very fair and equitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| that at that particular time people were not in favor of and looking at some compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| So I would hope that after this time has passed, six months has passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| that people would be a little more open-minded and receptive to looking at various options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| as I definitely am as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| So thank you all for sharing and being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| All right. Thank you, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| So I guess we now then move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| 9H is an ordinance amending and adopting the historic design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| for the existing Edgewood Park City Historic District Zoning Overlay, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| I'd like to call for a question before we make a motion on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| I'd like to ask the law director to please maybe explain to the audience that's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| and those that are watching what this actually means, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| These are additional or amended historic design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| for the H-1 overlay district out at Park City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| These are proposed new guidelines that would replace the old guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5180)|
| 1:26:27| Some folks think the term I have heard is they were watered-down guidelines to a certain extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5187)|
| 1:26:35| to make the new expansion of the H-1 overlay a little more sellable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| a little more acceptable to some folks who had concerns about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| So if you would like the current guidelines that are presently in place to remain in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| for that H-1 overlay that's been existing for some time now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| you simply move to deny this ordinance and leave them as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| If your interest is in watering down those guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| and amending them in the fashion that is provided here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| then you would move to approve these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| They do not die by operation of law as the change in classification did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5232)|
| 1:27:19| so they are still on your agenda and you have to decide what to do with them as a policy matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| Thank you for sharing that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| With that said, I'm going to move to decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| Okay, there's a motion to deny 9-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| The ayes have it and that is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| 9-I is an ordinance approving the request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| to amend the North City Sector Plan by amending the proposed land use map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| fourth and fifth districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=5279)|

| 1:46:57| Anita Riley, Churchy Riley, most people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| And I'm at 2063 Riverside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| And first of all, I want to thank you all for the opportunity to speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6425)|
| 1:47:12| And I'm representing the Lonsdale Homecoming Committee, and I have a few of our members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6432)|
| 1:47:24| First of all, we would like to thank the committee, our councilman, Mr. Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6444)|
| 1:47:30| I think you got a part of our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| Here I am, Ms. Riley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| We want to thank you all for supporting us the past few years at our Lonsdale Homecoming Committee event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6455)|
| 1:47:44| It's been 31 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| We've been doing this celebration, and we're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| We are now, because we have so many different diversities, we're getting ready to embrace that diversity in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6472)|
| 1:48:03| And this year we are calling ourselves the Lonsdale Homecoming International Celebration Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6483)|
| 1:48:10| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| We have a lot of diverse groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| As you know, our school, our elementary school is, I think, 33% Hispanic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6496)|
| 1:48:24| So we have a lot of that in our community, and we are trying this year to make this event include a lot of that that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6504)|
| 1:48:36| We'd like to thank the Parks and Recreation, because each year they have allocated things to help us out with extra curricular things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6516)|
| 1:48:46| with our trash pickup and stuff like that, which is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| And they have always supported us in that for the past 31 years, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| But mostly we want to invite you, the councilmen, and the mayor, who has been our grand marshal in our parade before in these past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6536)|
| 1:49:07| to come out and enjoy the celebration, just to help us to welcome and include a lot of the things that we're trying to do this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6547)|
| 1:49:21| And also, we are going to be asking again for your support and funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| So we are just here to let you know that we are going on again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| It's always the first weekend in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| And we just want to end on a happy note and say that we are just happy that this is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6573)|
| 1:49:41| We are very supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| It's going to be at a new park this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| We're going to the Lonsdale Park instead of the Sam Hill Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| And it's closer to their parts of the neighborhood also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| So we just want to thank you for all your support in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| And we want you all to continue to help us in making our celebration a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| Thank you, Mr. Riley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| That sounds like a wonderful idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| I really appreciate you and the whole committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Next is William Wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| Mr. Wall, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| And I'll set the timer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| I'm William Wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| I live at 1001 Glider Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| And my reason for being here tonight, and I wanted to thank Councilman Ryder for having me come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| And what we wanted to go over was that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| Sir, could you move that microphone a little closer with the noise from the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| Yeah, much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| Vietnam ended in 1975 officially, as Robert Cooper was seen at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon helping evacuate the embassy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6642)|
| 1:50:53| During that time, Americans were turning down our heads in shame due to the fact that we pretty much had lost during that time period, the war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6653)|
| 1:51:05| Vets were ridiculed and had eggs thrown at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| tomatoes, as I was marching in a memorial parade in Ohio, and I felt the embarrassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6669)|
| 1:51:19| Vets not just turned – vets not just from Vietnam, but World War II vets, Korean vets, felt the pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6679)|
| 1:51:28| Before I was drafted to join the U.S. – I joined the U.S. Navy instead of going into the Army just to get a better opportunity of being out to sea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6688)|
| 1:51:41| Ben Case, a good friend of mine that I grew up with in Hamilton, Ohio, had just arrived back from Vietnam himself, and he was distraught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6701)|
| 1:51:52| We grew up together, and within a week he had shot himself in the head and killed himself due to the guilt of the war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6712)|
| 1:52:02| U.S. Marines were in the front lines, taking the heat of the war as they died bravely in battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6722)|

| 1:52:14| Billy Joel wrote a song called Good Night, Saigon, and was asked why he wrote the song.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6734)|
| 1:52:21| He answered that he did not serve in Vietnam or in the military, but he had many good friends that actually died during that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6741)|
| 1:52:31| If you look deep into your souls and ask, what can we do for our vets now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| What else can we help them with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| My answer is that my friend Candace Burnett, who is sitting over here tonight with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6757)|
| 1:52:44| brought up the idea of why aren't vets paying for public transportation on the Knox area transit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6764)|
| 1:52:51| We should be giving them that transit free, just as a thank you for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6771)|
| 1:52:59| There are many vets that I know over at the VA center here that are crippled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6779)|
| 1:53:08| I have Parkinson's disease from Agent Orange when I was over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| They have limbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| There's vets with no limbs, PTSD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| And Candace brought it up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| At this forum, she encouraged me in saying, why are vets paying for this transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6801)|
| 1:53:29| Candace was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| Vets pay half price for transportation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| Our Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine vets that have lost limbs and that are homeless and suffering, why are they paying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6814)|
| 1:53:44| Why are we charging them public transportation when we could, as citizens of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6824)|
| 1:53:51| feel proud that we actually give them free transportation on our Knox area transit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6831)|
| 1:54:01| Would you like to see these fares erased and the service given to them in the near future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6841)|
| 1:54:09| And Billy Joel wrote the song, Good Night, Saigon, and this says it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| We had no cameras to shoot the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| We passed the hash pipe and listened to the door's tapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| And it was dark, so dark at night, and we held on to each other like brothers to brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6861)|
| 1:54:28| We promised our mothers we would write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| And we all went down together, and we all would go down together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| Yes, we would all go down together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| So I would ask the council if there's something we can do to help our vets out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6877)|
| 1:54:45| I think it would be our duty to give them the free transportation on Knox area transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| Sir, would you leave your contact information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| David, could you maybe get that from him so we can follow up with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| Mr. Brace will ask for your contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| And thank you for your service, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6903)|

| 1:55:12| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6912)|
| 1:55:13| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6913)|

| 1:55:23| I don't really have very much to say, and I'm not a public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| But I feel like this is a volunteer state, and our vets are volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| They serve the public, and I feel like it's sad to see a veteran walking down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| in public transportation and drive past them because they can't pay to have fare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| I've known many vets that actually have transportation issues due to health problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| Just due to finances, it could be lots of different reasons, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| And I didn't understand why that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| I didn't really know until I started watching Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| Okay, my friend, public transportation is not convenient at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| So if you can find a different way to get somewhere, you're definitely going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| So the only people who are going to take advantage of the free transportation is people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| who really have no other way to get anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| And we'll follow up with you and Mr. Wall to make sure that folks are aware of the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| that we have and there's more we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| Okay, next is Michelle Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| Is Michelle Brown here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| I don't believe she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| She phoned in, so Michelle Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| Okay, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| The last speaker is Meredith Loftus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| And you have up to five minutes, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| My name is Meredith Loftus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| I live at 2524 Jefferson Avenue in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| I'm also one of the pastors at First Presbyterian Church here in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| And I serve as co-president of Justice Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| Safe and decent affordable housing is a keystone issue for strong, healthy, vibrant communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7022)|
| 1:57:09| It affects almost everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| And we, as we have heard tonight, see that it is a huge crisis in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| And we need a long-term commitment to solve this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| Justice Knox is pleased to partner with Mayor O'Hara and her staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| to host an affordable housing summit in the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| a summit that we hope will bring stakeholders and decision-makers together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| to better understand this crisis and to identify long-term solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| And we hope that you will participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| and we will work to bring county decision-makers to the summit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| In our research, we have discovered that across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| local governments are solving the housing crisis through strong affordable housing trust funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| that provide reliable, continuous funding for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7075)|
| 1:58:00| Mayor O'Hara's Affordable Rental Development Fund lays the foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| for a strong housing trust fund here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| However, budget allocations for one, two, or even three years will not solve this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7089)|
| 1:58:17| We also cannot plan for and rely upon funding from the federal or state government to solve this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| We will need to think together to take continued local responsibility for this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7103)|
| 1:58:29| and to plan beyond Mayor O'Hara's tenure as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| And so I want to describe two critical components for a successful, strong affordable housing trust fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7113)|
| 1:58:40| dedicated public funding and targeted funding for the lowest-income people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7120)|
| 1:58:46| First and foremost, strong affordable housing trust funds receive ongoing dedicated public funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7126)|
| 1:58:53| In Nashville, for example, the metro government dedicated part of the short-term rental tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| the Airbnb tax, for the affordable housing trust fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| With so much at stake for working families, it is important to shift funding from annual budget allocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7143)|
| 1:59:10| to the commitment of dedicated public revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| Dedicated funding is smart financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| It guarantees a regular source of funds, allowing for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| Becky Wade stated during her budget hearings that funding for affordable housing is complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| sometimes making it difficult for projects to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| In our research, we learned that a project might require funding from anywhere from 9 to 13 different sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7171)|
| 1:59:39| many of which become available at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| With dedicated funding that is flexible and available from year to year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| our community becomes a lot more competitive for leveraging various other funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7187)|
| 1:59:54| including state money, federal money, private grants, and traditional bank loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| Even during the 2008 recession, when there was little to no housing development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| cities that had dedicated revenue for their affordable housing trust funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7206)|
| 2:00:11| saw continued building and development of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| Second, strong affordable housing trust funds have specific targets to serve people at different income levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7216)|
| 2:00:24| If you don't target the money, then it tends to flow to people with moderate needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| After all, it is economically easier to build affordable housing for a family making $50,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7229)|
| 2:00:36| than it is for a family earning $24,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| One in four Knoxville families, many working minimum wage jobs, are earning income in this lowest income range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7240)|
| 2:00:48| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| We were warned in our research by people in our local nonprofit community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| to be careful when we hear that money is being used for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| because it is rarely affordable for the poorest people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| And so we look forward to continued conversation and work with Mayor Rojero to strengthen what she has begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| And we also look forward to partnering with you to plan long-term solutions to this housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| As an organization, we will also work to bring county resources to bear on this problem and its solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7275)|
| 2:01:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| Okay, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| I'd like to respond to what you're bringing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| I think that there is a long-term plan going on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| and I implore you guys with Justice Knox to look into Recode Knoxville and what's going on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7294)|
| 2:01:41| In that is the density aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| There is an ADU, which is Additional Dwelling Unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| and that's something that it's not outside developers that are coming in and building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| It's not something that has to be city, state, federally funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| That is putting another home or another space dwelling unit on your property or in your basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7319)|
| 2:02:06| And it's a way that I know that mentally ill family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| or if you need to get more of an income into your home, it's a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7331)|
| 2:02:18| And that's something that a lot of neighborhood groups are opposing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| So I hope it's something that you guys pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| Well stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| Okay, so that is the end of our agenda, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180522?start=7349)|
