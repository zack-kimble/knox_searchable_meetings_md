| 2:26:33| So we'll get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| We'll get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| But it overlays into what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8795)|
| 2:26:38| whether there's actually going to be this rush to divide lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| And if it's a special use, it may not be quite the rush that you're anticipating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8803)|
| 2:26:50| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| I mean, the two go together, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| That's the way I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8813)|
| 2:26:54| So when we get to page 9.3, that's where it says it's a permitted use or a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8814)|
| 2:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| So can we or we're still on minimum lot area as proposed as the motion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8824)|
| 2:27:10| the 10,000 square feet, 7,500 and 7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8830)|
| 2:27:14| Councilman Wallace, can you clarify for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| 9-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| 9-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8838)|
| 2:27:19| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| 9-3, dwelling, two family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| R and 1, special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| R and 2, special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| R and 3, permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| And that's what, you know, when we get there, I would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| I'm going to suggest that we leave that at special and not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| Are you talking about R and 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| I'm just going to make a notation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| Earlier you said R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| My fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| R1 is special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8870)|
| 2:27:51| R2 is special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| R and 3 is permitted as it stands right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| You are saying you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8877)|
| 2:27:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| I'm going to suggest that you leave R and 3 as a special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| For dwelling, two family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| Dwelling, two family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| So we will get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8887)|
| 2:28:08| And you leave the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| The lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8892)|
| 2:28:13| I'd like to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| There's not a lot of R and 3 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| If somebody asks for rezoning, I think that's what they're working towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8898)|
| 2:28:23| And on top of that, to get special permission seems like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8903)|
| 2:28:27| having to go through the work twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| So that's my thought on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| The other one is it's great that the neighborhoods that have gotten together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| and were organized enough to look at the map and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| these are areas that we want in R and 1 or R and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| but there are a lot of neighborhoods who have not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| What will be the process to designate that this is an empty lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8923)|
| 2:28:48| and we can build a duplex on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| Well, in the R and 1, R and 2, R and 3, and R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| duplexes are permitted as a special use in R and 1 and R and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8936)|
| 2:29:01| and as a permitted use in R and 3 and R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| So if they have the lot size in R and 1 and R and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| they'd come before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| And currently in R and 3 and R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| they'd go to the plans review and obtain a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| And in the first year, that would not be necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| No, that would be necessary because that's not a zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8958)|
| 2:29:23| They're allowed, again, as a special use in R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8963)|
| 2:29:30| If you've got the lot size, you come to the planning commission for a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| In R and 3 and R and 4, if the lot meets the minimum lot area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| they would just obtain a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| Are there many areas that have been down-zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| where there could have been duplexes on it and now they won't be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8985)|
| 2:29:50| Actually, under our current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| there are many areas where duplexes are not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8993)|
| 2:29:56| Duplexes are permitted at varying levels of review in every zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=8996)|
| 2:30:02| except the established neighborhood under the new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| So from a broad perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| duplexes are permitted at a much higher level than under the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9008)|
| 2:30:14| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9014)|
| 2:30:17| Okay. So we have a motion and a second to approve this number 2 on this sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9017)|
| 2:30:22| which is table 4.1, revising the minimum lot area for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9022)|
| 2:30:28| Everybody knows what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| Okay. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| How many no's? One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| Just one no? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| So this passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9037)|
| 2:30:43| Okay. So that was page 4-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9043)|
| 2:30:47| Are there other issues in 4, in article 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9047)|
| 2:30:54| that we need to discuss or that anybody wants to bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9054)|
| 2:30:57| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| I just wanted to ask our law director about the residential occupancy standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9060)|
| 2:31:06| which seem to have been removed in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9066)|
| 2:31:10| I don't know if you could comment on that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9070)|
| 2:31:14| Yes, I can comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| I did note that they had been deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9076)|
| 2:31:21| I just have to tell you, as I have told you in private conversations before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| I'm really conflicted about residential occupancy standards in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9084)|
| 2:31:31| Generally what they do is they say how many people can live in a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| who are not related to one another, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| The reason that I am conflicted is because of the difficulty of enforcement of these residential occupancy standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9099)|
| 2:31:48| So generally what happens is we have these residential occupancy standards set out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9108)|
| 2:31:55| and that provides a general guideline to people who are living within a residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9115)|
| 2:32:02| who are not related to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| And for those who are law abiding, it provides a very good guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| Here's what the expectation is, and you're not allowed to have unrelated people beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9129)|
| 2:32:15| That would be a violation of the law in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| And so, you know, you find about 90%, 95% of the people who understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| and know what the law is wish to abide by the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9145)|
| 2:32:29| The rest of the folks don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| The rest of the folks will not abide by the law if they can get away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9151)|
| 2:32:35| And so what happens is people in neighborhoods see activity around a residence that's in their area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9155)|
| 2:32:43| and they see that in their mind this is probably a violation of the residential occupancy standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9163)|
| 2:32:50| And they come to us and they file a complaint with us about this particular residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9170)|
| 2:32:56| And so all we can do is send somebody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| Like Peter will go out, knock on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9179)|
| 2:33:02| Elsa and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| Peter or somebody who knows Peter will go out and knock on the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9184)|
| 2:33:09| and say how many unrelated people live in this residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| And they'll answer, if they're smart enough to know the law, they'll answer something within the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9192)|
| 2:33:18| At that point, because of constitutional reasons, legal reasons, we have very little we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9198)|
| 2:33:27| very, very little we can do to enforce those standards at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| That's very frustrating to the neighborhood, and I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| But there's very little that we can do without risking significant liability to the city for going beyond that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9215)|
| 2:33:42| and trying to enforce those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| So I guess where I come down on it is because such a large percentage of people are willing to be guided by the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9225)|
| 2:33:55| I would say it would be fine to put the residential occupancy standards back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9235)|
| 2:34:00| But just remember when your constituents come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9240)|
| 2:34:04| and want those residential occupancy standards to be very strictly enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9244)|
| 2:34:09| it's a very difficult, if not impossible, mechanism to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9249)|
| 2:34:13| And that's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| So that's my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| I'm good with them being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| But with that reservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9264)|
| 2:34:25| This was a topic that came up when I was speaking with the Kingston Pikes Sequoia Hills Neighborhood Association a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9265)|
| 2:34:35| And it also came up again when we had our second district-wide neighborhood discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9275)|
| 2:34:39| And folks expressed some concerns about those being missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9279)|
| 2:34:45| And so I thought it was a good thing for Council to discuss tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9285)|
| 2:34:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9290)|
| 2:34:51| Councilwoman Ryder, did you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9291)|
| 2:34:52| Well, I wanted to talk about something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| So am I going to make a motion to put them back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| Well, I would say, does anyone else have any comments on that section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9297)|
| 2:35:02| I think it's worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| They were vetted and lengthily discussed at the time that they were put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9305)|
| 2:35:13| We've had issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| We had a house in our neighborhood that had about 40 residents every night in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9315)|
| 2:35:21| And the city staff had to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| I'm not going to get into the details of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| But anyway, the house resolved itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| But, you know, enforcement was difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| I remember when Anita Cash was at the city and we had many conversations about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9332)|
| 2:35:37| But I think that there are various things that sometimes we put into the ordinances that give guiding thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9337)|
| 2:35:43| and give comfort to people even though they can't be enforced incredibly or 101 percent of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9343)|
| 2:35:54| As much as you would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9355)|
| 2:35:56| Those are nice words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9356)|
| 2:35:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9357)|
| 2:35:58| When you brought that up earlier today to us, staff checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| And apparently it's not been in any of the drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| But as the law director said, you know, I think it's good for those who want some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9363)|
| 2:36:10| And 95 percent of people will follow the law that's on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9370)|
| 2:36:14| For those that don't, like you said, just know we have limited ability to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| But we actually looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| If you make a motion to add it, it would be under, on page 4-2, 4.2 uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9383)|
| 2:36:35| And the suggestion from law was that it would be number three, that residential occupancy would be put back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9395)|
| 2:36:44| Is that correct, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| Actually, I think it might need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| I'm so sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9411)|
| 2:36:52| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9412)|
| 2:36:53| It's a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9413)|
| 2:36:54| Bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9414)|
| 2:36:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| I think actually it might need to be its own part C, don't you think, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9420)|
| 2:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| So under, so on page 4-2, 4.2 uses, there's an A, a B, and then we would add a C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9422)|
| 2:37:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| I have a question before we put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| I'll get right to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9434)|
| 2:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| And if we did that, we'd add a C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| And then we would take the wording of the current, of what the current zone has and would insert that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9437)|
| 2:37:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9443)|
| 2:37:24| I mean, the current wording for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9444)|
| 2:37:25| I would have to point out, though, and I've just pulled up the current code's language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9445)|
| 2:37:28| If you look at Part 3, we would need to rename those districts for the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| But that would be the only change that we would recommend from the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9457)|
| 2:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9461)|
| 2:37:42| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| Actually, that's what I wanted to see was the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9464)|
| 2:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9465)|
| 2:37:46| So are you recommending it, Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| Are you recommending, you know, leave it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| Or Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| I am recommending it with the caveat that you know it's difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9473)|
| 2:38:01| And so if you're prepared for the frustration level, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9481)|
| 2:38:06| Well, I don't want to put something back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| People are frustrated either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| If there's no rule there, people are frustrated that we're not, that we don't have some guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9489)|
| 2:38:15| But so either way, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| I would move that we put it in with the changes reflected in the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9497)|
| 2:38:22| I'd second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9502)|
| 2:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9503)|
| 2:38:24| We have a motion and a second to add 4.2C on page 4-2, which would be the residential occupancy regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9504)|
| 2:38:36| including changing, renaming the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9516)|
| 2:38:41| And so you all will need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9521)|
| 2:38:44| Is that any problem doing that, getting the equivalents and all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9524)|
| 2:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| Peter, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9529)|
| 2:38:50| I was going to say that no matter which way you go on this vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9530)|
| 2:38:54| we're going to enforce the other side, well, the other related issues, front yard parking, noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9534)|
| 2:39:05| all the other things that we regulate through the property maintenance codes, which are more enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9551)|
| 2:39:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9552)|
| 2:39:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9553)|
| 2:39:14| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9556)|
| 2:39:17| So in the event that we are able to substantiate that there are several people living in a residence that are unrelated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9557)|
| 2:39:24| what happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| So currently when I receive those complaints, I send an inspector out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| They ask the question of an occupant, how many people are residing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| If the answer exceeds the number allowed by the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| we let them know you are only limited to three, four, or five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| depending upon the location and the district that it's within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| And we say we'll be back in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| Some number of people need to have moved out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| We'll return after two weeks, knock on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9590)|
| 2:39:54| The occupant will tell us the right answer at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| They'll say, no, we only have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| And we'll say thank you, have a nice day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9601)|
| 2:40:04| So if they're related, if they're children, multiple children that exceed that limitation, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9604)|
| 2:40:11| They're a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9611)|
| 2:40:12| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9612)|
| 2:40:13| They can have nine children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9613)|
| 2:40:14| As long as it's a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| Unrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9616)|
| 2:40:17| It's only unrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9617)|
| 2:40:18| They cannot be fraternity brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9618)|
| 2:40:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| They have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9620)|
| 2:40:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| But as long as they're blood relatives, there's no repercussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| No, it's not blood relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9625)|
| 2:40:26| It's not necessarily blood because you can have adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| Okay, as long as they follow the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| So the example given to us when I was on Neighborhood Advisory Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| and this was discussed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9636)|
| 2:40:37| is you could have two unmarried adults and they could each have an unnamed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9637)|
| 2:40:44| unlimited number of children for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| Let's say they each had, you know, 20 kids apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9647)|
| 2:40:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9650)|
| 2:40:51| So you've got a woman with 20 kids and another woman with 20 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| Those 20 are related to the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9656)|
| 2:40:57| The other 20 are related to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| They're related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9659)|
| 2:41:00| Correct, Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9660)|
| 2:41:01| Is that, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9661)|
| 2:41:02| We were given some extreme examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9664)|
| 2:41:05| The Brady Bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9665)|
| 2:41:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9666)|
| 2:41:07| They're allowed not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9667)|
| 2:41:08| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9668)|
| 2:41:09| And who wouldn't want the Brady Bunch as your neighbor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9669)|
| 2:41:13| This goes to show how complicated it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| When we start knocking on the door and dealing with people who don't know the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| But if a landlord has a lease that has four different individuals on it that's unrelated, would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9682)|
| 2:41:28| I don't have access to the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| You can't request it when you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9690)|
| 2:41:33| You can request it, but you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| You can't demand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| You can't subpoena it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| Well, I can always request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9699)|
| 2:41:40| I think that the point that was being made was that this is difficult to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9700)|
| 2:41:49| and so we were kind of having that discussion, which we had at the second district discussion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9709)|
| 2:41:55| But it's really, it's kind of like guardrails and like the law director was saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9715)|
| 2:42:01| you have so many people who, you know, will obey the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| If you remove this, then you're open to a lot of interpretation of what could go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9726)|
| 2:42:12| So I see this as more of a guardrail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| So I think this is a good thing to put back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9734)|
| 2:42:19| Councilwoman, same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9741)|
| 2:42:22| Peter, does this allow for three generations of people to be living in a home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9742)|
| 2:42:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9746)|
| 2:42:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9747)|
| 2:42:28| Families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| So does anybody in the audience want to speak to the residential occupancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9752)|
| 2:42:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| David Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| I'm also the president of Norwood Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| We've talked about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| We are very supportive of the effort to put this back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9764)|
| 2:42:49| We have been dealing with certain residents that do have multiple nonrelated persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9769)|
| 2:42:56| and it is extremely difficult, but we would rather keep what tools are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9776)|
| 2:43:02| I second Charlie's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| However, without it, it makes it more difficult to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| So we would support that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9791)|
| 2:43:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9796)|
| 2:43:17| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9797)|
| 2:43:18| I'm so sorry, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9800)|
| 2:43:21| The other thing that I just was discussing with Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| the term functional family is also defined in its own section as 22, I believe, of Article V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9804)|
| 2:43:33| So we would need to include that as well from the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9813)|
| 2:43:37| You just lost me there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| So I have pulled up right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| This is the definition for the section on the residential occupancy standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9821)|
| 2:43:48| Functional family is defined in our current code, but at the subsequent section, which is section 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9828)|
| 2:43:55| And so we would probably need to bring that in as well so that this section had a definition for functional family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9835)|
| 2:44:01| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9841)|
| 2:44:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9842)|
| 2:44:03| Don't you need to bring over section 21 and section 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9847)|
| 2:44:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| So what is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| How should the motion read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| Part C of 4.2 in RECODE, I believe, would need to start with the residential occupancy standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9857)|
| 2:44:24| and then there would need to be a Part D defining functional family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9864)|
| 2:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| So C would be the residential occupancy standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| and Part D would define functional family as per the current code language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9873)|
| 2:44:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9885)|
| 2:44:46| Do you accept that as part of your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9887)|
| 2:44:48| And you're second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9888)|
| 2:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| I'm actually not going to vote to include this back in the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9891)|
| 2:44:54| It feels a little discriminatory to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| I'm listening to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| I think what we're trying to prevent is the impact on surrounding neighbors, and that's noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9898)|
| 2:45:06| It's traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9906)|
| 2:45:07| It's parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| It's, you know, building codes, violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| I mean, I'm not going to protest, but I just am not going to vote to include this back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9913)|
| 2:45:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9918)|
| 2:45:19| Clearly can be interpreted different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9919)|
| 2:45:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9922)|
| 2:45:23| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9926)|
| 2:45:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9927)|
| 2:45:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9928)|
| 2:45:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9929)|
| 2:45:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9930)|
| 2:45:31| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| How many noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9933)|
| 2:45:34| One, two, three, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9934)|
| 2:45:38| Four noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9939)|
| 2:45:40| It passes 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9940)|
| 2:45:42| Do you have those noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9942)|
| 2:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9943)|
| 2:45:44| So Glenn McKenzie, Seema Singh-Pervez, George Wallace, and Stephanie Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9944)|
| 2:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9950)|
| 2:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9951)|
| 2:45:52| That's a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| Anything else for Article 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9955)|
| 2:46:04| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| Can we ask Director Green about the changes to the minimum interior side setbacks for R and 2, R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9966)|
| 2:46:12| and R and 4 that are in Draft 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| What page are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| Page 4-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9976)|
| 2:46:18| It is the Table 4-1 for everybody in the other draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9978)|
| 2:46:23| It's Table 4-1, Residential Districts, Dimensional Standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| R and 2, R and 3, and R and 4, the minimum interior side setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9987)|
| 2:46:32| have dropped from 8 feet to 5 feet in all three of those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9992)|
| 2:46:37| That was based on comments that with a 50-foot wide lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=9997)|
| 2:46:41| if you had 8 feet setback on either side, that's 16 feet, 50 minus 16 is 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10001)|
| 2:46:48| It starts resulting in a very narrow house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10008)|
| 2:46:53| It reduces the buildable area of the lot significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10013)|
| 2:46:59| We looked at historic neighborhoods, some even in the Old North, Oakwood, Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10019)|
| 2:47:06| that 5 feet seemed the average setback when a lot had a width of 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10026)|
| 2:47:15| So we're trying to not reduce, restrict the ability to build on a more narrow lot, a 50-foot wide lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10035)|
| 2:47:24| Keeping in mind that no less than 15 feet combines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| It allows for 5 foot on one side and maybe the other side 10 foot with the driveway going down the side of the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10049)|
| 2:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10060)|
| 2:47:43| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| I'm going to leave it at that for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| Ms. Feld, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10071)|
| 2:47:52| Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10072)|
| 2:47:53| Just a little bit of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10073)|
| 2:47:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10074)|
| 2:47:55| The current code has regulations for small lots of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10075)|
| 2:47:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10078)|
| 2:47:59| And this actually affords more protection than the current small lot of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10079)|
| 2:48:04| A current small lot of record has a minimum side setbacks of 5 foot but no less than 12 combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10084)|
| 2:48:11| So it would be 5 and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10093)|
| 2:48:14| So these regulations are actually giving more protection because it's no less than 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10094)|
| 2:48:22| There are a lot of examples where R and 2 is applied to larger lots, which is an earlier conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10102)|
| 2:48:29| So I'm just mulling it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| I'm not arguing about it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| I don't have a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10112)|
| 2:48:33| And keep in mind these are minimum side setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| They're not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| If you have a larger lot, our hope is that you don't build a house that's quite as large or as wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10119)|
| 2:48:48| And some of those larger lots can be addressed as we go through the mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10128)|
| 2:48:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10133)|
| 2:48:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10134)|
| 2:48:55| Ms. Feld?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| I just want to say that I was having fun, but I have to say I'm getting kind of tired now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10139)|
| 2:49:03| I'm not sure you are, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| The pizza will be here soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10145)|
| 2:49:06| Maybe that will perk you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10146)|
| 2:49:07| Are we going to do all 18 articles tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10149)|
| 2:49:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| We're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10151)|
| 2:49:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| I'm 1540 Iberwilla Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| And I'm going to talk about single family design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10160)|
| 2:49:27| Where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10167)|
| 2:49:28| Oh, you said any more comments on Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10168)|
| 2:49:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10171)|
| 2:49:32| Yeah, on Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| So what page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| Oh, well, it's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| No page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10176)|
| 2:49:37| Page no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| Those standards, those residential design standards for single family were in an earlier draft but have been deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10181)|
| 2:49:47| Two earlier drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| Were they in Chapter 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| Very not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10192)|
| 2:49:53| Article 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| I think they were in Chapter 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10195)|
| 2:49:58| They were actually set forth in Article 10, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| Well, I don't know when I'm supposed to be speaking about this, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| But since they were referenced here, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10210)|
| 2:50:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| So the first two drafts did include minimal design standards for single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| And I'm sorry, I'm speaking as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10218)|
| 2:50:22| And we, meaning Scenic Knoxville, would like to see them included back into the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10222)|
| 2:50:29| Similar standards are very common in the zoning codes of other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| They encourage thoughtful planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| They preserve community character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| They ensure that homes are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| And they preserve, protect, and enhance the city's historical, architectural, and aesthetic resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10240)|
| 2:50:47| Design standards are what make people proud to call their house a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10247)|
| 2:50:51| And we believe that everyone is entitled to feel this way, no matter what neighborhood they live in or whether they're a renter or an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10251)|
| 2:50:59| So there were five standards listed originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10259)|
| 2:51:04| And I can read them to you or sort of summarize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10264)|
| 2:51:08| If we're going to get into that kind of detail, we should wait until we're at 10, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10268)|
| 2:51:12| Because that's where it would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| Is that what you told me, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10275)|
| 2:51:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10276)|
| 2:51:17| It would have been in Article 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10277)|
| 2:51:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10278)|
| 2:51:19| So if you're going to get into that kind of detail, it would be something they would need to consider in 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10283)|
| 2:51:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10284)|
| 2:51:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10285)|
| 2:51:26| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10286)|
| 2:51:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10287)|
| 2:51:28| Sorry, Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10288)|
| 2:51:29| I hope I don't have to say all that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10289)|
| 2:51:30| And you don't want to hear it again anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| There's the E& district design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10291)|
| 2:51:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10294)|
| 2:51:35| And they are much more comprehensive, much more detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10295)|
| 2:51:40| These are really –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10300)|
| 2:51:41| And they're in Section 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| But the standards for single-family design were in Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10308)|
| 2:51:54| But this is a section on residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| I don't really care when she talks about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10316)|
| 2:51:57| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10317)|
| 2:51:58| I said, I don't really care when she talks about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| I'm just telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10321)|
| 2:52:02| Are you ready to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10322)|
| 2:52:03| I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10323)|
| 2:52:04| I think we should go ahead and hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10324)|
| 2:52:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10325)|
| 2:52:06| I'm sorry, Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10326)|
| 2:52:07| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| Gerald already knows what I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10328)|
| 2:52:09| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10329)|
| 2:52:10| Get it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10330)|
| 2:52:11| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10331)|
| 2:52:12| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10332)|
| 2:52:13| We are talking about residential standards, so it makes sense to me they'd be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10333)|
| 2:52:17| Anyway, so there are five of them, and we would like to see you put all five back in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10337)|
| 2:52:25| If you don't want to put all five back in, I would at least like to see you consider some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10345)|
| 2:52:30| I mean, what happened was they all got thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10350)|
| 2:52:33| So it doesn't have to be all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| You could put some of them back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| Hopefully, you'll put all of them back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| But, you know, they have to do with –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10359)|
| 2:52:42| I've sent this document to most of you, but I know you've all slept since then and read a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10362)|
| 2:52:49| So do you want me to say what they are or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10372)|
| 2:52:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10373)|
| 2:52:54| So on lots less than one acre, a dwelling must have a primary entrance from a façade facing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10374)|
| 2:53:01| And the front entry must be a dominant feature on the front elevation of a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10381)|
| 2:53:06| and an integral part of the structure using features such as porches, raised steps and stoops and or roof overhangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10386)|
| 2:53:14| Two, windows, entrances, porches or other architectural features are required on all street-facing façades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10394)|
| 2:53:21| to avoid the appearance of blank walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| Three, I think it was originally a 20% minimum transparency requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10404)|
| 2:53:33| In other words, windows applies to all street-facing façades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10413)|
| 2:53:37| and is calculated on the basis of the entire area of the façade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10417)|
| 2:53:42| Four front-loaded garage attached garages are limited to 60% of the width of the front building line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10422)|
| 2:53:49| or 24 feet, whichever is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| Garage width is measured as the width of a garage door, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10432)|
| 2:53:57| Five, front-loaded attached garages must be set back a minimum of five feet from the front building façade line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10437)|
| 2:54:04| This façade building line does not include architectural features such as bay windows or porches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10444)|
| 2:54:10| I'm sure you all have this memorized now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| Anyway, I just hope you could talk about them and think about adopting at least some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10454)|
| 2:54:21| because I really think that they help to preserve the character of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10461)|
| 2:54:25| and I think that they help to keep homes appealing, they help to protect property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10465)|
| 2:54:32| and everybody deserves to live in a home that they feel proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10478)|
| 2:54:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| Mr. Green or Council Member Welch, can you explain what the decision was with the committee to take them out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10481)|
| 2:54:51| I'll defer to Mr. Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10491)|
| 2:54:56| I was curious what the problem was that we were trying to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10496)|
| 2:55:00| If we were seeing poor designs in residential construction and we really didn't see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10500)|
| 2:55:06| there was never a good answer as to what we're trying to fix when it comes to new homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10506)|
| 2:55:11| And so my point from the operations side is all of these regulations add complexity to a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10511)|
| 2:55:21| There's a negative impact as far as affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10521)|
| 2:55:24| There's a time component with my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10524)|
| 2:55:28| And so my point was if we don't have a clear problem, we don't really need a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10528)|
| 2:55:36| And they're still with the infill housing overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10536)|
| 2:55:41| That remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| The protections that are afforded today remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10544)|
| 2:55:47| So it would be infill housing, NC1, H1, EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10547)|
| 2:55:53| So we're not reducing the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| We're just not ramping them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10559)|
| 2:56:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10562)|
| 2:56:03| Did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10566)|

| 2:56:12| I don't have much to add to this, but just wanted to point out that a priority for our organization is home affordability in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10572)|
| 2:56:19| Knoxville has had double digit price per square foot increases for every year in the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10579)|
| 2:56:25| Our home affordability is very not competitive compared to surrounding municipalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10585)|
| 2:56:30| and we know that that's something everyone's aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| And these are, as Peter mentioned, solving a problem that may not exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10593)|
| 2:56:39| and would certainly not help with home affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10603)|
| 2:56:44| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10604)|
| 2:56:45| I can't see you, so I don't know if I know you or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10605)|
| 2:56:53| I'm Michael Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10613)|
| 2:56:54| I live at 1307 Michaels Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| And I think she's talking about 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| So unless I've got the wrong revision up, it's still in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10620)|
| 2:57:10| Okay, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10630)|
| 2:57:11| I can go away then, but I'm really against it because there's no reason for eight sides to a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10631)|
| 2:57:17| I've talked to several contractors, and they're talking $20,000 to $30,000 more to build an eight-sided house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10637)|
| 2:57:23| opposed to like a rancher, four-sided house, and all this other stuff that's in here about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10643)|
| 2:57:30| But since I'm in the wrong time slot, I'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10650)|
| 2:57:33| You're responding to 4.4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| That's the established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| Established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10657)|
| 2:57:38| And those standards were developed about 10 years ago and were brought into this code in their entirety without change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10658)|
| 2:57:45| So those standards have been in place for about 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| and seem to have worked well in the established neighborhoods of Olson Hills, Old Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10668)|
| 2:57:55| I think those are the two established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| So what's the definition of an established neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10677)|
| 2:58:03| All the established neighborhoods that work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| That's a zoning designation that certain neighborhoods have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10685)|
| 2:58:12| It applies to a very small number of parcels in the big scheme of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10692)|
| 2:58:17| It's not the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| It's a very small number of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| Okay, so there's my misunderstanding then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| Well, you understand this correctly, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| It's just that it doesn't apply to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| It only applies to a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| It can be very confusing, if I can for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10711)|
| 2:58:34| It can be very confusing, and this is something we talked about in the second district meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10714)|
| 2:58:39| All of the neighborhoods that we talked to in that meeting all consider themselves established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10719)|
| 2:58:46| So we talked about, you know, walking around on the street, if you talk about, hey, this is my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10726)|
| 2:58:51| you're going to say, well, that's an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| That's not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10733)|
| 2:58:54| There's a provision in here that you go through an application process to achieve that status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10734)|
| 2:59:00| So you have to separate the two definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| There's a status that gives certain requirements and options for the neighborhood to select in EN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10743)|
| 2:59:13| not the, you know, normal discussion we would have about what an established neighborhood is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10753)|
| 2:59:17| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10762)|
| 2:59:23| Okay, so I guess we would need direction from council based on what Ms. Feld said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10763)|
| 2:59:32| Is there any interest in having staff revise these or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10772)|
| 2:59:40| I'm reading them, I mean, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10780)|
| 2:59:44| Revising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10784)|
| 2:59:45| I mean, adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| They're asking that the residential design standards be added back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10787)|
| 2:59:51| Obviously it's not something we would do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| The question is whether there's interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| If there's not a majority of council that wants to see this, or let me put it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10795)|
| 3:00:00| if there is a majority of council that wants these to be added back in, then we would ask staff to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10800)|
| 3:00:07| You've heard pros and cons of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| So if there's somebody that wants to see those added back in, that would be added to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| Is that right, Article 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10815)|
| 3:00:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10816)|
| 3:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10817)|
| 3:00:18| Then I would need a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10818)|
| 3:00:19| And if it passes, then staff would work to add it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10819)|
| 3:00:25| If there's not a majority, then we would move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10825)|
| 3:00:32| And as Joyce requested, it can be, are there some that look more attractive than others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10832)|
| 3:00:37| It doesn't have to be all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10837)|
| 3:00:41| Which draft was it last in, Director Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10841)|
| 3:00:46| 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10846)|
| 3:00:47| Because I couldn't find it in looking at any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10847)|
| 3:00:54| Ms. Feld says draft 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10854)|
| 3:00:59| It was draft 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10859)|
| 3:01:00| I just looked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10860)|
| 3:01:01| And draft 4, you can see strikeouts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10863)|
| 3:01:04| I have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10864)|
| 3:01:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10865)|
| 3:01:06| And draft 4 is what went to the Planning Commission for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10866)|
| 3:01:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10870)|
| 3:01:11| And they recommended adoption without those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10871)|
| 3:01:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10874)|
| 3:01:15| And it applied to all single-family dwellings, no matter what zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10875)|
| 3:01:20| No matter what zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10880)|
| 3:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10881)|
| 3:01:22| I'll speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| You know, I think, in general, I favor design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10884)|
| 3:01:29| But I'm kind of leaning towards Peter and saying we're really not fixing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10889)|
| 3:01:34| I think there are cases where you could go back, take it in a primary entrance facing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10894)|
| 3:01:38| It's not in traditional neighborhood development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10898)|
| 3:01:41| They don't face the street sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10901)|
| 3:01:44| They're turned slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10904)|
| 3:01:47| Architectural features facing the street is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| Twenty percent transparency is probably fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| The front garage, it gives me a little bit of heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| It's not, I think, a 60% max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10914)|
| 3:01:57| That is cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10917)|
| 3:01:58| And then the setback with 20 feet can also be cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10918)|
| 3:02:02| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10922)|
| 3:02:03| Water it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10923)|
| 3:02:04| You might be able to get it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10924)|
| 3:02:05| But I'm probably in favor of not having them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10925)|
| 3:02:09| I don't see a lot of bad development out there, especially in the city where the land prices are pretty high already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10929)|
| 3:02:15| And we're trying to get the maximum use out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| I'm not in favor of enforcing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10940)|
| 3:02:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10944)|
| 3:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10945)|
| 3:02:26| So is there anybody that wants to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10946)|
| 3:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10950)|
| 3:02:31| I see none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10951)|
| 3:02:32| So we will move on from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10952)|
| 3:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10953)|
| 3:02:34| Anything else on Article IV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10954)|
| 3:02:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10961)|
| 3:02:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10962)|
| 3:02:43| Carly, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10963)|
| 3:02:45| And this is, again, you know, kind of tidy housekeeping, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10965)|
| 3:02:51| On page 4-8, 4.5, Section 4.5, R and 4 District Pocket Neighborhood Design Standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10971)|
| 3:03:05| I would simply ask that the pocket neighborhood design be shown on the use matrix in Article IX| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10985)|
| 3:03:12| and be shown specifically in which zones it's going to be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10992)|
| 3:03:16| If you read this, it suggests that it's only permitted in R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=10996)|
| 3:03:21| And I think we need to make that clear so that nobody has the impression that it's permitted in other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11001)|
| 3:03:28| but doesn't have to follow these standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| So, again, you know, just tidy housekeeping, put it in the matrix, show us where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11011)|
| 3:03:38| The challenge with that is the use matrix is a use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11018)|
| 3:03:42| The pocket neighborhood is not a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| It's a design standard for multifamily, basically what we would consider multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11024)|
| 3:03:52| It's several housing units on one property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11032)|
| 3:03:57| So, again, it's not a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| Then we would start putting all types of design approaches in the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11039)|
| 3:04:06| I think we can clarify that pocket neighborhood is considered a multifamily and multidwelling development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11046)|
| 3:04:13| because it's multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11053)|
| 3:04:18| But to put it in the use matrix, I think, is starting to mix apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11058)|
| 3:04:23| We can, again, clarify that as a multifamily development, it's permitted in starting R and 4 but R and 5, R and 6, R and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11063)|
| 3:04:35| It is not a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11075)|
| 3:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11077)|
| 3:04:38| If we want to, that's a clarification I can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| If you look at this, it appears that it's only in R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11081)|
| 3:04:45| It says R and 4 district pocket neighborhood standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11085)|
| 3:04:49| It doesn't mention R and 5, 6 or 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11089)|
| 3:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11092)|
| 3:04:53| So we're just asking for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11093)|
| 3:04:56| If you don't want to put it in the use matrix, at least be clear as to where it does go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11096)|
| 3:05:01| Should we, Mr. Green, should we strike R and 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11101)|
| 3:05:04| I think striking R and 4 would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11104)|
| 3:05:06| I'd move to strike R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11106)|
| 3:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11108)|
| 3:05:09| That's on page 4-8 at the very top where it says 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11109)|
| 3:05:14| Then it says R and 4 district pocket neighborhood design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| Can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11118)|
| 3:05:19| The motion is to strike R and 4 because we were just talking about the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11119)|
| 3:05:26| That's the motion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11126)|
| 3:05:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11128)|
| 3:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11129)|
| 3:05:30| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11130)|
| 3:05:31| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11131)|
| 3:05:32| If we move it to not be in R and 3 or R and 2 or any other R and since it's not a use, it's a design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11132)|
| 3:05:43| let's keep it in R and 4 and list the districts and where it is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11143)|
| 3:05:49| If you strike R and 4, then you just have pocket neighborhood design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11149)|
| 3:05:56| Remember, is it on the matrix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| And it may be inappropriate to have it on the matrix, but right now, it doesn't tell you where you can have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11159)|
| 3:06:05| Again, it would be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| Can you speak closer to the mic so I can hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| It is a multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| It states pocket neighborhood is a clustered group of dwellings gathered around a common courtyard or open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11171)|
| 3:06:17| I think in our interpretation, this is just one type of multifamily development, and we're establishing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11177)|
| 3:06:26| I would love to see the word multifamily in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11188)|
| 3:06:29| Should we add multifamily or make it clear that it's on one parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11189)|
| 3:06:34| Because I guess that is a little, it is not totally clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11194)|
| 3:06:38| We can revise the definition to state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11198)|
| 3:06:41| The pocket neighborhood is defined, and we can revise the definition to make that more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11201)|
| 3:06:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11206)|
| 3:06:47| Should I withdraw my motion to have it clarified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11207)|
| 3:06:52| I think your motion to delete RM4 here and clarify the definition in the Article 2 of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11212)|
| 3:07:04| May I make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11224)|
| 3:07:05| Mr. Frost, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11225)|
| 3:07:09| Mr. Ahrens is asking me if we can revise the definition and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11229)|
| 3:07:12| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11232)|
| 3:07:13| We've been doing it a lot, kind of by the seat of our pants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11233)|
| 3:07:16| You can see how important this is and the need for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11236)|
| 3:07:20| So maybe your suggestion is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| Maybe Mr. Green's suggestion is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11242)|
| 3:07:25| Maybe Councilman Starr's suggestion is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| I'm just telling you, what you read here can be interpreted every which way but loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11247)|
| 3:07:32| And I think that's an injustice and needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11252)|
| 3:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11257)|
| 3:07:38| That's what we're talking about is how to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| So, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11260)|
| 3:07:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11262)|
| 3:07:44| I have a suggestion that Councilmember Starr says delete RM4 from the title of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11264)|
| 3:07:50| Maybe say a pocket neighborhood is a clustered group of dwellings gathered around a common courtyard or open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11270)|
| 3:07:55| which is maintained in a shared stewardship of residence and may be permitted in RM4, RM5, RM6, or RM7 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11275)|
| 3:08:06| So you're saying you're listing out the different zones where it may be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11286)|
| 3:08:13| Hopefully that would clarify things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| I think that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11295)|
| 3:08:16| Would that clarify, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| That would clarify and I think is a simple approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11301)|
| 3:08:22| Which I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11302)|
| 3:08:23| Good job there, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11303)|
| 3:08:25| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| Oh, I'm sorry, former Councilman, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11307)|
| 3:08:32| You've been dying to make a motion, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11312)|
| 3:08:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11314)|
| 3:08:36| So whose motion is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11316)|
| 3:08:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11318)|
| 3:08:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11319)|
| 3:08:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11320)|
| 3:08:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11321)|
| 3:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11322)|
| 3:08:43| And so we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11323)|
| 3:08:44| Please repeat your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11324)|
| 3:08:46| Please repeat Mr. Starr's motion, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11326)|
| 3:08:50| The title for Section 4.5 will strike the RM4 from that and then the end of the first sentence will list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11330)|
| 3:09:04| and which may be permitted in RM4, RM5, RM6, or RM7 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11344)|
| 3:09:15| Assuming that it would be appropriate RM6 or RM7, so I defer to Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11355)|
| 3:09:20| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11360)|
| 3:09:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11361)|
| 3:09:22| Meet your objective, Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11362)|
| 3:09:25| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11365)|
| 3:09:26| We clarified it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11366)|
| 3:09:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11367)|
| 3:09:28| So there is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11368)|
| 3:09:29| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11369)|
| 3:09:32| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11372)|
| 3:09:33| The word district in the title, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11373)|
| 3:09:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11375)|
| 3:09:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11376)|
| 3:09:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11377)|
| 3:09:38| RM4 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11378)|
| 3:09:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11379)|
| 3:09:40| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11380)|
| 3:09:41| RM4 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11381)|
| 3:09:42| Both get stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11382)|
| 3:09:43| How many fourth district reps does it take to modify this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11383)|
| 3:09:47| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11387)|
| 3:09:48| Bill, I'm hoping you're slacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11388)|
| 3:09:50| Would everyone who's ever served as a fourth district councilperson please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11390)|
| 3:09:55| I think District 4 is really overrepresented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11399)|
| 3:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11401)|
| 3:10:02| Thank you very much, Councilman Dahl-Lobie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11402)|
| 3:10:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11404)|
| 3:10:05| So we're striking RM4 and district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11407)|
| 3:10:08| And adding the zones that may be permitted in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11411)|
| 3:10:12| Are we clear now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11412)|
| 3:10:13| And she's got that up there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11413)|
| 3:10:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11415)|
| 3:10:16| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11417)|
| 3:10:18| Are we clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11418)|
| 3:10:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11419)|
| 3:10:20| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11420)|
| 3:10:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11421)|
| 3:10:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11422)|
| 3:10:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11423)|
| 3:10:24| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11424)|
| 3:10:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11425)|
| 3:10:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11426)|
| 3:10:27| Approved unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11427)|
| 3:10:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11428)|
| 3:10:29| So anything else on four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11429)|
| 3:10:30| The pizza is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11430)|
| 3:10:31| And when we are finished with four, we will eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11431)|
| 3:10:32| Anything else on four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11432)|

| 3:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11775)|
| 3:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11776)|
| 3:16:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11777)|
| 3:16:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11778)|
| 3:16:19| So they look less historic and specific to a certain style of building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11779)|
| 3:16:25| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11785)|
| 3:16:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11786)|
| 3:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11788)|
| 3:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11789)|
| 3:16:30| Are there questions from council for Gerald or Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11790)|
| 3:16:40| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11800)|
| 3:16:41| Mayor, just for clarification, is this where we're going to start talking about issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| that we wanted to discuss for this section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11805)|
| 3:16:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11810)|
| 3:16:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11811)|
| 3:16:52| So, if you look on page 5-1, the CG general commercial zone district, I think that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11812)|
| 3:17:00| needs to be added in there, that that's intended for indoor retail use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11820)|
| 3:17:06| And the reason for that is if you look at number three right below it, it has the distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11826)|
| 3:17:12| that kind of midway through it, permanent outdoor service or storage areas, so requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11832)|
| 3:17:19| permanent outdoor storage or service areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11839)|
| 3:17:21| So it's clearly talking about outdoor storage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11841)|
| 3:17:25| I think the intention in CG is that that's really for indoor use, so I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11845)|
| 3:17:33| there was any comment from Gerald or Peter about that, but it seems like some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11853)|
| 3:17:42| there is probably a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11862)|
| 3:17:47| And I'm thinking for a minute, I think your comment is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11867)|
| 3:17:50| I'm trying to think of those, listen to some of our citizens too long, and I think of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11870)|
| 3:17:56| worst case scenario now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| But I think if there's a business that may have, for example, if Mayo Outdoor Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11878)|
| 3:18:05| wanted to be located closer to downtown on one of our corridors that's designated CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11885)|
| 3:18:10| they have a lot of outdoor storage even though it's secondary, I don't want to limit to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11890)|
| 3:18:20| extent that it may put a restriction on certain uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11900)|
| 3:18:24| I'm trying to think of how we could word that so that maybe primarily indoor retail, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11904)|
| 3:18:31| that work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11911)|
| 3:18:32| I would think some clarification there that that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11912)|
| 3:18:35| While they would have the ability for temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11915)|
| 3:18:38| Primarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11918)|
| 3:18:39| I think primarily would work for me, but I'd like to hear it from everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11919)|
| 3:18:50| Where might that be in the first sentence is intended, or where would you put that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11930)|
| 3:18:59| We'll let them take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| I think maybe the second sentence is CG district is intended to promote mixed-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11941)|
| 3:19:06| in a pedestrian-oriented environment that serves primarily, and I'm thinking now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11946)|
| 3:19:14| provides opportunities for primarily indoor retail businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11954)|
| 3:19:21| Let us work on that and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11961)|
| 3:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11964)|
| 3:19:25| Let me just see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11965)|
| 3:19:26| Is there a majority of council that want us to review that or just get some nods, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11966)|
| 3:19:34| heads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11974)|
| 3:19:35| People are fine with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11975)|
| 3:19:36| I'm fine with reviewing it, but when you gave the example of Mayo's, I'm thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11976)|
| 3:19:39| Stanley's that's in South, I just want to be careful that we're not precluding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11979)|
| 3:19:43| Yeah, and Stanley's is different, it won't be CG, so we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11983)|
| 3:19:49| All right, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11989)|
| 3:19:50| I'll usurp Ms. Malone, possibly, but I will say, okay, so our current commercial districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11990)|
| 3:19:57| and zones have been CG, or I'm sorry, I'm getting all confused now, aren't I, C1, C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=11997)|
| 3:20:03| C3, C4, and our outdoor uses have primarily been in C4, our C3 is what neighborhoods have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12003)|
| 3:20:12| There have been times where people applied for C4 and got C3, and the neighborhoods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12012)|
| 3:20:19| surrounding property owners have counted on that in terms of outdoor storage, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12019)|
| 3:20:24| my experience, in a lot of instances, it's been things like pawn shops, but the limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12024)|
| 3:20:30| in people's investments have centered around the differences between C3 and C4, and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12030)|
| 3:20:35| we're combining them into one broad definition of CG, and I think that's the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12035)|
| 3:20:41| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12041)|
| 3:20:42| CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12042)|
| 3:20:43| Well, C3 is the equivalent for C4, it allows outdoor storage, used car lots, the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12043)|
| 3:20:56| self-service storage, none of those would be permitted in CG, which is the equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12056)|
| 3:21:01| of C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12061)|
| 3:21:03| So all those existing C3s now become CG, C4s, become CGs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12063)|
| 3:21:09| C3s become CGs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| C3s and C4s become CGs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| No, C3s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12073)|
| 3:21:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12074)|
| 3:21:15| But we have C4s on Broadway, and those are becoming CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12075)|
| 3:21:18| C8s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12078)|
| 3:21:19| No, they're becoming CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12079)|
| 3:21:20| No, they're becoming CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12080)|
| 3:21:21| No, they're becoming CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12081)|
| 3:21:22| Because what we're trying to do is to address, there was never a zone neutral, the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12082)|
| 3:21:31| of the mapping were to limit, to reduce non-conformities, to address current uses of property and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12091)|
| 3:21:36| implement city policy and goals, and one of the city policies is to make those corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12096)|
| 3:21:42| more pedestrian-friendly, and we don't do that by zoning them C4 or C8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12102)|
| 3:21:48| So those, like Broadway, is now primarily CG to implement that city policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12108)|
| 3:21:56| And that's really a map issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12116)|
| 3:21:57| I mean, that gets back to the map issue, do you try to do zone equivalent, or do you try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| to do, you know, what the city policy and the division is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12121)|
| 3:22:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12126)|
| 3:22:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12127)|
| 3:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12128)|
| 3:22:09| Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12129)|
| 3:22:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12131)|
| 3:22:12| Carly Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12132)|
| 3:22:13| And this is really a big issue, and I'll call your attention to the definition, well, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12133)|
| 3:22:19| purpose statement of CG, which is a pedestrian-oriented environment that recalls the city's traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12139)|
| 3:22:30| business districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12150)|
| 3:22:33| Okay, C3 has not allowed outdoor uses, outdoor storage yards for scrap and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12153)|
| 3:22:42| It has been primarily indoor retail with very limited outdoor uses, and that distinguishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12162)|
| 3:22:52| it from C4 at present, and it's an important distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12172)|
| 3:22:58| And based on that distinction, C3s have been put in our communities, located in our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12178)|
| 3:23:05| because of, rather than C4s, because of those distinctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12185)|
| 3:23:13| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12193)|
| 3:23:14| There are businesses, as well as residents, who have made investments based on the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12194)|
| 3:23:21| that they're not going to have some loud, noisy thing operating outside next to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12201)|
| 3:23:24| Panera or whatever, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12204)|
| 3:23:29| This would represent an enormous change and put in place the potential for enormous conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12209)|
| 3:23:36| of uses and undermine the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12216)|
| 3:23:39| And the way it's written now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12219)|
| 3:23:40| Yes, and I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12220)|
| 3:23:43| What's added to the fifth draft in Article 9 is outdoor amusements and CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12223)|
| 3:23:52| Go-karts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12232)|
| 3:23:53| Go-karts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12233)|
| 3:23:54| You name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12234)|
| 3:23:55| Outdoor amusements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12235)|
| 3:23:56| That is specifically prohibited in C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12236)|
| 3:24:01| So this needs to be taken, you know, it's not just outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| It's not just out, flue markets are not allowed in C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12245)|
| 3:24:09| They're in C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12249)|
| 3:24:12| These distinctions are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12252)|
| 3:24:14| It's the difference between Clinton Highway and Broadway and Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12254)|
| 3:24:20| Clinton Highway is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12260)|
| 3:24:22| It serves a purpose of highway commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12262)|
| 3:24:27| But if you start mixing that with indoor, specifically indoor uses, you end up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12267)|
| 3:24:38| a degradation of all the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| So I would suggest you look very carefully, make it very clear that CH is outdoor, CG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12281)|
| 3:24:51| is indoor, and when you get to the matrix and you get to the accessory uses and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12291)|
| 3:24:59| look very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12299)|
| 3:25:00| I mean, how do you want Bearden to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12300)|
| 3:25:03| How do you want Fountain City to look as our business districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12303)|
| 3:25:07| That's what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12307)|
| 3:25:10| And just to comment on the, again, the diversity of opinion in Knoxville, the request for outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12310)|
| 3:25:19| amusements in CG came from a developer, a major developer in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12319)|
| 3:25:28| The compromise was to propose it as a special use in the CG, which would require planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12328)|
| 3:25:34| commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12334)|
| 3:25:36| If council directs that to be stricken from the use matrix, we can do that when we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12336)|
| 3:25:41| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12341)|
| 3:25:42| But again, it's trying to balance the different opinions and desires of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12342)|
| 3:25:49| I don't envy your position at all, but I just want to make it clear that it's not, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12349)|
| 3:25:58| and I think, Mayor, you mentioned this, it's not that staff thought these things up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12358)|
| 3:26:02| our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12362)|
| 3:26:03| They were brought to us by members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| And that's why we had this opportunity to discuss that we know where these different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12365)|
| 3:26:08| things came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12368)|
| 3:26:09| Sometimes it's because we think it will be helpful to administration, to enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12369)|
| 3:26:14| or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12374)|
| 3:26:15| In this case, this is a request, we've got another side to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| It's council's job to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| And if I could say, Mayo's is always the example that's brought forward because, yeah, we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12379)|
| 3:26:26| love Mayo's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12386)|
| 3:26:29| If somebody wants an outdoor use, there are zones available for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12389)|
| 3:26:33| The question is, does it have to be in every zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12393)|
| 3:26:36| And when you talk about a use on review, that's a steep hill to climb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12396)|
| 3:26:39| It enables you to put limitations, talk to your attorneys, to put limitations that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12399)|
| 3:26:44| reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12404)|
| 3:26:45| But it doesn't mean you get to turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12405)|
| 3:26:49| And if you try to turn it down, you better have a firm reason put on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12409)|
| 3:26:55| Last I checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12415)|
| 3:26:56| Or courts will overturn you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12416)|
| 3:26:58| So it's not a free for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12418)|
| 3:27:00| It's another opportunity to have another fight before council and try to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12420)|
| 3:27:07| What you need to decide is what you want for C3, what you want for downtown, what you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12427)|
| 3:27:12| in Fountain City, what you want in Bearden, what you want in Clinton Highway, what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12432)|
| 3:27:16| want on Asheville Highway, what you want on Chapman Highway, those are the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12436)|
| 3:27:22| And if somebody wants outdoor uses in their neighborhood, then they ought to get the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12442)|
| 3:27:28| for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12448)|
| 3:27:29| But everyone should not have to live with what somebody else wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12449)|
| 3:27:32| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12452)|
| 3:27:33| And just as Peter just pointed out to me, C3, the current C3 zone does permit outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12453)|
| 3:27:40| storage as a secondary use as long as it's screened from adjacent residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12460)|
| 3:27:48| What we identified as a secondary use for outdoor storage as a special use is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12468)|
| 3:27:53| more, and the CG is actually more restrictive than currently in the C3 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12473)|
| 3:28:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12480)|
| 3:28:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12481)|
| 3:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12482)|
| 3:28:03| So, Councilman Roberto, then, and Gerald, where are we on this then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12483)|
| 3:28:13| I think we should have some indication about indoor uses here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12493)|
| 3:28:20| There's clearly one that's outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12500)|
| 3:28:23| This one's certainly supposed to be primarily indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12503)|
| 3:28:26| And so there's probably some language we can insert here that would help that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12506)|
| 3:28:30| And if that's the direction of Council, we can work on that and have it for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12510)|
| 3:28:34| Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12514)|
| 3:28:35| I'd like to, instead of trying to wordsmith it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12515)|
| 3:28:39| No, we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12519)|
| 3:28:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12520)|
| 3:28:41| So, next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12521)|
| 3:28:42| Is there any objection from any Council member that we look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12522)|
| 3:28:44| You will still have to vote later on it, but, okay, so everyone's open to considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12524)|
| 3:28:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12529)|
| 3:28:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12530)|
| 3:28:51| So, Gerald, just to clarify, because there's CG1 and there's CG2, when I look at Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12531)|
| 3:28:57| there's some areas of the CG2 that are right next to residential, and there are some areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12537)|
| 3:29:02| where there are other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12542)|
| 3:29:03| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12543)|
| 3:29:04| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12544)|
| 3:29:05| So, like how you did a graduation of heights in the residential code, if something abuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12545)|
| 3:29:10| a residential zone, maybe there needs to be a distinction based on if you're X number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12550)|
| 3:29:15| of feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12555)|
| 3:29:16| I'm just brainstorming, and we don't have to finish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12556)|
| 3:29:17| I just want to throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| If that's, if you're speaking of the height and the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12559)|
| 3:29:22| I don't mean the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12562)|
| 3:29:23| I mean some of the outdoor uses, or, you know, go-karts, or, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12563)|
| 3:29:28| You know, again, those are special uses, and that's something that the, rather than trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12568)|
| 3:29:34| to anticipate what all the uses would be and how to adjust the setbacks or screening as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12574)|
| 3:29:41| special uses, they can be considered on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12581)|
| 3:29:45| And I'd like to talk with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12585)|
| 3:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12588)|
| 3:29:50| In my previous employment with special uses, the Planning Commission could deny that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12590)|
| 3:29:58| if they felt the impacts were adverse to the adjacent properties, and I'd like to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12598)|
| 3:30:04| his, and I won't get into that conversation now, but just to clarify that so that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12604)|
| 3:30:09| comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12609)|
| 3:30:10| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12610)|
| 3:30:11| Because I, you know, my, I've told our Planning Council that my thought is that if a use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12611)|
| 3:30:17| review of special use has adverse impacts on the adjoining property, they can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12617)|
| 3:30:24| those impacts through mitigation measures or deny their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12624)|
| 3:30:28| And so I'll get with Mr. Swanson and get clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12628)|
| 3:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12633)|
| 3:30:34| Nick Delahovie, Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12634)|
| 3:30:37| Can I make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12637)|
| 3:30:42| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12642)|
| 3:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12643)|
| 3:30:44| Former Councilman Frost, and then we'll have former Councilman Delahovie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12644)|
| 3:30:47| Just as a thought, maybe if you're talking about the CG, you have like a not-to-exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12647)|
| 3:30:53| percentage of outdoor area or footprint not in the required parking area, something along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12653)|
| 3:30:59| those lines, if you're looking for some sort of limitation to not have it predominantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12659)|
| 3:31:04| outdoors like the CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12664)|
| 3:31:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12666)|
| 3:31:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12667)|
| 3:31:08| That's something they can consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12668)|
| 3:31:11| Nick Delahovie, District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12673)|
| 3:31:15| Yes, withdrawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12675)|
| 3:31:16| Why don't we just put at the end of that number two on page 5.1A2 to help our Scrivener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12676)|
| 3:31:26| The zone is intended primarily for indoor uses, comma, with limited exceptions under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12686)|
| 3:31:32| a special use review or application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12692)|
| 3:31:35| Just something that clarifies it without nailing it so tight that whatever, the mayos can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12695)|
| 3:31:41| do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12701)|
| 3:31:43| Use the word primarily and for indoor uses with limited exceptions under a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12703)|
| 3:31:48| application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12708)|
| 3:31:49| That would kind of set the tone for what he's going to do in the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12709)|
| 3:31:53| Nick, could I get you to repeat that one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12713)|
| 3:31:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12715)|
| 3:31:56| Or do you have it written down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12716)|
| 3:31:57| Can you hand it to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12717)|
| 3:31:58| No, I just scratched in the margin as we were talking, but this zone is intended primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12718)|
| 3:32:02| for indoor commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12722)|
| 3:32:06| This zone is intended primarily for commercial indoor uses with limited exceptions under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12726)|

| 3:32:12| With limited, maybe you could put with limited outdoor exceptions for under a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12732)|
| 3:32:18| application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12738)|
| 3:32:19| Thank you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12739)|
| 3:32:20| So they can review that between now and when we meet the next time and see if there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12740)|
| 3:32:26| wording they're comfortable with recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12746)|
| 3:32:28| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12748)|
| 3:32:29| Did you get that, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12749)|
| 3:32:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12752)|
| 3:32:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12753)|
| 3:32:34| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12754)|
| 3:32:36| Are there other questions on Article V?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12756)|
| 3:32:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12762)|
| 3:32:43| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12763)|
| 3:32:44| My name is Greg McWhorter, 1408 Kensington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12764)|
| 3:32:50| Article V really is the tip of an iceberg for a whole set of issues for me that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12770)|
| 3:32:57| worked extensively on throughout the process of RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12777)|
| 3:33:01| And I just want to tell you that, A, I'm a commercial real estate developer, investor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12781)|
| 3:33:06| I'm not opposed to RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| I really support the effort, and I really am very appreciative of the process that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12789)|
| 3:33:14| had to this point to have the public input that we've had for something this complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12794)|
| 3:33:20| is an incredibly difficult thing to do, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12800)|
| 3:33:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12805)|
| 3:33:27| Hot-button issues from the beginning have been a careful consideration of how we deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12807)|
| 3:33:35| with nonconforming uses and structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12815)|
| 3:33:38| I think we're all tempted as we think about RECODE to consider how we want things to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12818)|
| 3:33:45| We're envisioning new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12825)|
| 3:33:48| The reality is the vast majority of the commercial property in the city of Knoxville is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12828)|
| 3:33:57| It exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12837)|
| 3:34:01| So the elephant in the room for me always has been we can envision what we want, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12841)|
| 3:34:09| the really difficult questions are how do we move from what legally exists in the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12849)|
| 3:34:17| of these new standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| And I think those issues are really, really complicated, and Mr. Green and I have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12859)|
| 3:34:25| a number of conversations about that, and they've been really productive conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12865)|
| 3:34:29| I think, and he's not always agreed with me, but he's always been very willing to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12869)|
| 3:34:34| to my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12874)|
| 3:34:35| And so these issues are presented for me here in Article V because we have the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12875)|
| 3:34:46| design standards, and then we have commercial dimensional standards, and I haven't counted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12886)|
| 3:34:52| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12892)|
| 3:34:53| There's probably a couple of dozen commercial dimensional standards, and then there's commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12893)|
| 3:34:56| design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12896)|
| 3:35:00| The commercial design standards have their own rule as to when prior legally nonconforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12900)|
| 3:35:11| uses and structures will be required to comply with the requirements of new code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12911)|
| 3:35:15| and that's a 30% expansion rule, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12915)|
| 3:35:19| That's sort of a carryover from a previous draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12919)|
| 3:35:23| We very substantially revised Article 17 that governs these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12923)|
| 3:35:33| Article 17 does not, it needs to be much better integrated with the balance of the code, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12933)|
| 3:35:41| my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12941)|
| 3:35:42| So in Article V, the commercial dimensional standards don't have a 30% trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12942)|
| 3:35:50| It's just silent as to when the dimensional standards would apply to a previously developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12950)|
| 3:35:57| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| You know, let's face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12959)|
| 3:36:00| Most of the time, it's really difficult for a previously developed property that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12960)|
| 3:36:06| comply with dimensional standards, setbacks, heights, yard requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12966)|
| 3:36:11| It's really difficult to change those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12971)|
| 3:36:14| Then you've got Article 17 that has a new set of criteria that, for me, I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12974)|
| 3:36:25| just a lot of ambiguities in Article 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12985)|
| 3:36:28| So with that background, I'm just here to ask you for permission to maybe out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12988)|
| 3:36:35| I don't think there's any way possible to deal with these really complicated issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12995)|
| 3:36:39| of nonconforming uses and structures in a meeting like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=12999)|
| 3:36:46| I would ask your permission for an opportunity after this meeting to meet with Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13006)|
| 3:36:51| and whoever else he would suggest to take one more pass at these new revisions and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13011)|
| 3:36:59| if we can't come back to council with something that we all agree may be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13019)|
| 3:37:04| They may not like my thoughts, but I'm concerned that we would go to press with what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13024)|
| 3:37:10| got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13030)|
| 3:37:11| And I'll do my best to address my specific concerns if you want, but it would be a really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13031)|
| 3:37:16| really cumbersome...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13036)|
| 3:37:17| And so these are both in Article V and 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13037)|
| 3:37:20| Article 17.6 and the parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13040)|
| 3:37:22| You know, the parking requirements have a 50% cost of redevelopment rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13042)|
| 3:37:28| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13048)|
| 3:37:29| That's been stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13049)|
| 3:37:30| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13050)|
| 3:37:31| No, it's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13051)|
| 3:37:32| It's been clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13052)|
| 3:37:33| Sir, are you looking at the December draft or the current May draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13053)|
| 3:37:36| I'm looking at Revision 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13056)|
| 3:37:37| Revision 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13057)|
| 3:37:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13058)|
| 3:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13059)|
| 3:37:40| I'd be happy to have that conversation with you about the nonconformities, but we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13060)|
| 3:37:42| go back to the exact language that the current code has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13062)|
| 3:37:46| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13066)|
| 3:37:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13067)|
| 3:37:48| I understand that, and I'm glad to talk through my concerns in as much detail as you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13068)|
| 3:37:57| here tonight, but I don't think that would be a terribly productive use of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13077)|
| 3:38:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13082)|
| 3:38:03| Mr. McWhorter and I spoke during the dinner break, and I suggested that he meet with Christina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13083)|
| 3:38:10| Peter, and me to go over these and clarify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13090)|
| 3:38:14| Some of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13094)|
| 3:38:17| He's correct on design standards with the expansion of an existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13097)|
| 3:38:23| They don't kick in until they're at the 30% expansion, but only to the expansion, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13103)|
| 3:38:29| to the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13109)|
| 3:38:30| I think there's just some clarification, some discussion that we need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13110)|
| 3:38:34| And I think that's inconsistent with what we said in Article 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13114)|
| 3:38:39| We need...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13119)|
| 3:38:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13120)|
| 3:38:41| So I think that's a great idea for you three to meet with Mr. McWhorter, and then can we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13121)|
| 3:38:46| We'll do it before May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13126)|
| 3:38:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13128)|
| 3:38:49| So we have May 30th, which then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13129)|
| 3:38:50| And then if you get...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13130)|
| 3:38:51| Of course, in any of these recommendations, it's helpful to send them out early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13131)|
| 3:38:56| I would, if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13136)|
| 3:38:57| I'm sorry we didn't do this, but anything that's a significant change, if it's prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13137)|
| 3:39:05| early enough and can be shared early enough, that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13145)|
| 3:39:09| But we'll deal with whatever comes before us on May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13149)|
| 3:39:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13152)|
| 3:39:13| Based on conversations I've had, I'm hopeful that substantively there's not huge differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13153)|
| 3:39:19| of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13159)|
| 3:39:20| The only, you know, the only observation I would make is, and I think we all would agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13160)|
| 3:39:25| that these triggers or these rules need to be fair and reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13165)|
| 3:39:30| And if they're too burdensome, what will happen is we'll chill redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13170)|
| 3:39:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13176)|
| 3:39:37| And that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13177)|
| 3:39:38| I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13178)|
| 3:39:39| It just happened to a very substantial project that I'm working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13179)|
| 3:39:43| And that's not what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13183)|
| 3:39:46| Anybody wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13186)|
| 3:39:47| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13187)|
| 3:39:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13188)|
| 3:39:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13189)|
| 3:39:50| So if y'all will follow up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13190)|
| 3:39:52| Council agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13192)|
| 3:39:53| Let them follow up and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13193)|
| 3:39:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13194)|
| 3:39:55| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13195)|
| 3:39:56| Just a minute, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13196)|
| 3:39:57| Let me see what Councilwoman Ryder wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13197)|
| 3:39:58| Don't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13198)|
| 3:39:59| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13199)|
| 3:40:00| I've lost my page here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13200)|
| 3:40:03| I was going to address something here and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13203)|
| 3:40:06| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13206)|
| 3:40:07| Page 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13207)|

| 3:40:09| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13209)|
| 3:40:10| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13210)|
| 3:40:11| I got going down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13211)|
| 3:40:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13212)|
| 3:40:13| It's hard to keep up with all the pathways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13213)|
| 3:40:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13216)|
| 3:40:17| Page 5-2 in Draft 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13217)|
| 3:40:20| Section A states that, as I understand it, states that Article 9 lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13220)|
| 3:40:29| Article 9 is the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13229)|
| 3:40:32| Lists permitted and special principle uses and temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13232)|
| 3:40:36| So what we see in the matrix is the permitted uses, the special principle uses, and the temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13236)|
| 3:40:45| But then when you come down here to Part C, it says the following use restrictions apply to the OP district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13245)|
| 3:40:51| Daycare centers, eating, list them all out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13251)|
| 3:40:54| It says they are prohibited as standalone structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13254)|
| 3:40:58| So they are accessory uses to the OP, as I understand C there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13258)|
| 3:41:09| So they're listed in the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13269)|
| 3:41:11| They're not entirely accessory uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13271)|
| 3:41:15| Accessory is subservient to an existing use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13275)|
| 3:41:19| For example, a daycare center could operate in an office park and not be part of another business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13279)|
| 3:41:28| but it cannot be in a standalone structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13288)|
| 3:41:31| What we're trying to do, and this is in response to some public comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13291)|
| 3:41:35| concerns about office parks being used for uses that may be detrimental to the neighborhoods around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13295)|
| 3:41:43| and have adverse impacts and not wanting those as large standalone uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13303)|
| 3:41:47| They have to be integrated in the building, in the larger building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13307)|
| 3:41:52| They may not be an accessory to a principle use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13312)|
| 3:41:55| They may be a principle use in the case of a daycare center that's operating there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13315)|
| 3:41:59| but it cannot be a standalone building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13319)|
| 3:42:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13325)|
| 3:42:06| I know it's a bit confusing, and I apologize for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13326)|
| 3:42:09| but they can be a principle use but cannot be in a standalone building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13329)|
| 3:42:15| So that is your contention as to why they're in the matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13335)|
| 3:42:19| like a primary or a temporary use or a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13339)|
| 3:42:23| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13343)|
| 3:42:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13346)|
| 3:42:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13349)|
| 3:42:30| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13350)|
| 3:42:32| If I could just say in the OP district, it says the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13352)|
| 3:42:37| The district is oriented toward larger scale complexes that may include accessory services for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13357)|
| 3:42:46| such as personal services, restaurants, and retail establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13366)|
| 3:42:52| So in the description of the purpose, they're listed as accessory services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13372)|
| 3:43:01| and there are other places where they are also listed as accessory services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13381)|
| 3:43:08| Now, that's not daycare, and again, that's why we wonder why they're listed on the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13388)|
| 3:43:18| And if you look at the definitions, it's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13398)|
| 3:43:21| Something that's a principle use is not an accessory use or service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13401)|
| 3:43:28| And here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13408)|
| 3:43:30| I mean, having them having to be incorporated into the major building is an important characteristic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13410)|
| 3:43:36| and an important quality, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13416)|
| 3:43:39| But here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13419)|
| 3:43:40| If you want an office park and one were to allow as principle uses inside a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13420)|
| 3:43:46| what are generally considered commercial uses, such as restaurants and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13426)|
| 3:43:51| you wouldn't have any offices unless it's going to be accessory to something that looks like an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13431)|
| 3:43:58| Your office park is going to be another commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13438)|
| 3:44:04| Why in heaven's name would you sell property cheaper for office uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13444)|
| 3:44:11| when you could put commercial uses as long as they were in another building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13451)|
| 3:44:14| and didn't have to have another principle use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13454)|
| 3:44:16| It was accessory, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13456)|
| 3:44:18| So if you want an office park, I think you're going to have to treat them, treat these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13458)|
| 3:44:22| Maybe not daycare centers, but restaurants, personal service establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13462)|
| 3:44:29| and whatever the third one was, retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13469)|
| 3:44:34| We really need to be accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13474)|
| 3:44:37| There has to be a principle use there for it to be serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13477)|
| 3:44:48| Response from staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13488)|
| 3:44:53| And I'm still challenged with how Peter would, you know, there's Aubrey's in the office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13493)|
| 3:45:01| I don't work in the office park, but I go to that Aubrey's restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13501)|
| 3:45:05| Peter's going to come find me because that makes it not an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13505)|
| 3:45:11| I think that we've addressed the concern by saying that these uses cannot be in a stand-alone building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13511)|
| 3:45:18| They must be integrated into the office park and the other office uses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13518)|
| 3:45:25| If we start saying, in my mind, accessory is secondary to an existing use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13525)|
| 3:45:30| how can we argue that a restaurant is secondary to my doctor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13530)|
| 3:45:35| It has no relationship, no ownership relationship, no operational relationship to that doctor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13535)|
| 3:45:42| It may serve, maybe we need to strike in the purpose section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13542)|
| 3:45:47| may include accessory, strike accessory, and may include services for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13547)|
| 3:45:53| And that makes it clear that it's primarily intended to serve the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13553)|
| 3:45:56| but it's not an accessory to one of the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13556)|
| 3:45:59| It's secondary and has some operational management or ownership relationship to the principal uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13559)|
| 3:46:05| Can I ask for clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| I'm going to probably make myself look kind of ignorant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13567)|
| 3:46:10| Currently we have office zones, but we don't have an OP zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13570)|
| 3:46:14| The OP is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13574)|
| 3:46:15| We have office zones, office one and office two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13575)|
| 3:46:20| I'm trying to remember the different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13580)|
| 3:46:25| So is the OP a new animal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13585)|
| 3:46:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13587)|
| 3:46:28| What's the existing office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13588)|
| 3:46:30| What's office three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13590)|
| 3:46:32| Oh, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13592)|
| 3:46:34| Oh, and I-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13594)|
| 3:46:40| So the Aubrey's, the zoning of that office park is currently, I mean, I can look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13600)|
| 3:46:47| I just, I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13607)|
| 3:46:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13608)|
| 3:46:49| That was just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13609)|
| 3:46:50| It's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13610)|
| 3:46:51| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13611)|
| 3:46:52| Look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13612)|
| 3:46:53| May not exist in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13613)|
| 3:46:54| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13614)|
| 3:46:57| Are we getting to that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13617)|
| 3:46:59| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13619)|
| 3:47:00| We're back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13620)|
| 3:47:01| Only I'm doing it instead of council members right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13621)|
| 3:47:04| Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13624)|
| 3:47:05| I think right now this more closely resembles what we deal with on a regular basis in the industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13625)|
| 3:47:11| Sutherland, a lot of that is checkerboarded with industrial, but we've got folks that want to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13631)|
| 3:47:16| and they want to have some sort of business because, well, it fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13636)|
| 3:47:21| And so I get all sorts of applicants saying, and if you look in the industrial district regulations now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13641)|
| 3:47:27| it has to be, you know, retail for the employees of the industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13647)|
| 3:47:33| Well, how many industries do you see going down Sutherland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13653)|
| 3:47:37| And so if somebody makes a case to me that, yeah, this is my, this is my service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13657)|
| 3:47:45| and I'm marketing towards the industries on Sutherland, go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13665)|
| 3:47:51| I'm hoping that through this process, I think we might be able to agree that there's parts of Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13671)|
| 3:47:57| that really don't need to be industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13677)|
| 3:47:59| I'm hoping that as we get the map right, we don't have as many people trying to jockey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13679)|
| 3:48:05| into existing spaces where the zone doesn't really align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13685)|
| 3:48:13| Here's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13693)|
| 3:48:14| Putting a restaurant in a more intense zone known as industrial is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13694)|
| 3:48:19| Putting commercial in a less intense zone known as office as a principal use is another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13699)|
| 3:48:27| These, the most, the largest generation of trips is a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13707)|
| 3:48:34| The lowest of the non-residential uses are offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13714)|
| 3:48:38| Office parks are intended to be large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13718)|
| 3:48:41| They're intended to serve the people who are there as employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13721)|
| 3:48:47| and the people who are their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13727)|
| 3:48:51| Once again, if you allow a use as intense as restaurants and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13731)|
| 3:48:57| just because it has to be neatly tucked away in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13737)|
| 3:49:00| you will not have an office park with an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13740)|
| 3:49:03| You'll have an office park that's nothing but commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13743)|
| 3:49:06| And when somebody says, don't put office park in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13746)|
| 3:49:10| you'll know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13750)|
| 3:49:12| Because they know they're not getting an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13752)|
| 3:49:17| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13757)|
| 3:49:19| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13759)|
| 3:49:20| We can delete restaurants from the office park eating and drinking establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13760)|
| 3:49:25| and then when all the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13765)|
| 3:49:28| I don't think you have to rest a judgment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13768)|
| 3:49:29| I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13769)|
| 3:49:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13770)|
| 3:49:31| I don't agree with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13771)|
| 3:49:32| I wasn't finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13772)|
| 3:49:33| I don't agree at all with what Ms. Malone just said about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13773)|
| 3:49:35| I mean, office park is definitely a more intense zone than office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13775)|
| 3:49:39| And we have that now and we have that opportunity now and it's a good fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13779)|
| 3:49:43| So let's don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13783)|
| 3:49:44| I don't think she represents what we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13784)|
| 3:49:47| And then at lunchtime when all those employees need to go get something to eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13787)|
| 3:49:51| they'll be driving through the residential streets to get to the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13791)|
| 3:49:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13794)|
| 3:49:55| Let's don't go overboard on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13795)|
| 3:49:58| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13798)|
| 3:49:59| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13799)|
| 3:50:00| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13800)|
| 3:50:01| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13801)|
| 3:50:02| I had a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13802)|
| 3:50:03| Amy, we are going to give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13803)|
| 3:50:06| Don't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13806)|
| 3:50:08| What if there was another solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13808)|
| 3:50:10| What if we go to the use chart on 9-3 and when you get to personal services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13810)|
| 3:50:16| restaurants and retail establishments, instead of putting a P, put an A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13816)|
| 3:50:22| Because an A for accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13822)|
| 3:50:27| Would that fix the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13827)|
| 3:50:32| That's a whole new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13832)|
| 3:50:33| We don't have A's anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13833)|
| 3:50:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13835)|
| 3:50:36| I think we'd have to go through every use and add A's where appropriate if we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13836)|
| 3:50:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13842)|
| 3:50:45| Accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13845)|
| 3:50:47| I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13847)|
| 3:50:48| Do you want to speak to that, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13848)|
| 3:50:50| If anything, you know, if you're looking for some sort of compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13850)|
| 3:50:53| even if it were created or presented as a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13853)|
| 3:50:57| it makes it a public process for one of those more intense uses to go into an office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13857)|
| 3:51:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13865)|
| 3:51:07| And just to point out as well, on page 9-1, section 9.2, part A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13867)|
| 3:51:18| specifically says, you know, the use matrix is for principal and temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13878)|
| 3:51:24| So the accessory right now would not work unless we, I guess, make changes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13884)|
| 3:51:31| I think maybe Peter's comment about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13891)|
| 3:51:34| I think it's fine that it's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13894)|
| 3:51:36| Eating and drinking establishment is permitted use in OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13896)|
| 3:51:40| That is an intense commercial zone for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13900)|
| 3:51:42| So I don't have a problem with being permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13902)|
| 3:51:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13906)|
| 3:51:47| Is there any, does any council want to see anything different than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13907)|
| 3:51:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13911)|
| 3:51:52| Well, then, let's leave that as it is at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13912)|
| 3:51:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13916)|
| 3:51:57| Now, Amy Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13917)|
| 3:51:58| I'm Amy Nolan, Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13918)|
| 3:52:00| 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13920)|
| 3:52:02| This is a section that we spent a lot of time on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13922)|
| 3:52:05| and it's also a section we spent a lot of time on with our members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13925)|
| 3:52:09| For the past two years, I think we had four workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13929)|
| 3:52:13| One of the things that we preached over and over and over to our members is look at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13933)|
| 3:52:19| Look at your properties on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13939)|
| 3:52:21| You know, make sure that they're, the uses that you had are the uses that you're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13941)|
| 3:52:28| This is where we run into a so-called zone neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13948)|
| 3:52:32| They're really, if you look at C6 properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13952)|
| 3:52:35| there might be C6 properties that are now IMU based on their use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13955)|
| 3:52:40| They might be CH and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13960)|
| 3:52:43| So I think this section really points to the fact why we need to look at the zone in conjunction with the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13963)|
| 3:52:52| Because this is the area where my members have really worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13972)|
| 3:52:56| And with Gerald, I know he can tell you he's had lots of calls about the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13976)|
| 3:53:00| So that's the only point I wanted to make because that's where they have really been focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13980)|
| 3:53:07| Second point is we do have a use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| One of the things that our members have asked for is to have a similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13989)|
| 3:53:14| So in C6, this was allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13994)|
| 3:53:18| Where, what does that line up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=13998)|
| 3:53:21| CH1, have a use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| CG1, what does that line up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14003)|
| 3:53:26| We do have a use matrix, but we don't have really the before and after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14006)|
| 3:53:31| So they really have no idea if their property with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14011)|
| 3:53:35| They know, well, I think I want to put this in there or might redevelop it as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14015)|
| 3:53:41| But it's really the zoning's looked at what the current use of the property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14021)|
| 3:53:45| And that might not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14025)|
| 3:53:48| And so that's why the map has been so important to go along with this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14028)|
| 3:53:54| I'd just like to say that I really appreciate the work that Amy has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14034)|
| 3:53:58| and the Chamber of Commerce in getting the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14038)|
| 3:54:01| I have talked to a lot of business owners about the mapping of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14041)|
| 3:54:05| And although we do not have a use matrix for our current zoning ordinance, we do have the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14045)|
| 3:54:10| and it's online, the zone comparison table that aligns or aligns the proposed zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14050)|
| 3:54:18| with the current zoning and the equivalency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14058)|
| 3:54:23| And I'm not sure, given the scattered nature of our current zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14063)|
| 3:54:28| how challenging it would be to do a use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14068)|
| 3:54:31| We'll try, but I'm not sure how easy it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14071)|
| 3:54:36| because our current zoning ordinance is fairly scattered in its permission of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14076)|
| 3:54:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14085)|
| 3:54:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14088)|
| 3:54:49| So what else on five, Article V?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14089)|
| 3:54:55| Anything else on Article V?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14095)|
| 3:55:00| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14100)|
| 3:55:02| I just want to make something clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14102)|
| 3:55:04| We were not saying that you shouldn't have restaurants and so on in OP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14104)|
| 3:55:09| Our position was just they should be accessory, not principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14109)|
| 3:55:14| But, okay, our next thing, page 5-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14114)|
| 3:55:24| Instead of saying single family district, it's Article V, Section 5.3b on page 5-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14124)|
| 3:55:33| Can we use the zoning district name, RN1, RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14133)|
| 3:55:38| instead of saying single family residential district just because it would be clearer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14138)|
| 3:55:43| And on page 5-6, Article V, Section 5.4b, building materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14143)|
| 3:55:49| Two, it says aluminum, steel, or other metal siding is, I guess, prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14149)|
| 3:55:59| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14159)|
| 3:56:00| Can you, let's do one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14160)|
| 3:56:03| Just get a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14163)|
| 3:56:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14164)|
| 3:56:05| The first one was on page 5-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14165)|
| 3:56:07| Yeah, and it's just substitute RN1, RN2 for single family residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14167)|
| 3:56:13| That's 5.3b.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14173)|
| 3:56:14| What do you think about that, Gerald and Sarah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14174)|
| 3:56:17| I think if we, I'm not sure why to waste the ink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14177)|
| 3:56:23| I mean, I think we know what the single family districts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14183)|
| 3:56:27| And Ms. Malone left one out, the EN district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14187)|
| 3:56:31| We may create additional districts in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14191)|
| 3:56:34| We've already talked about creating one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14194)|
| 3:56:36| Let's just, I think our staff and Peter's staff could easily determine what a single family district is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14196)|
| 3:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14204)|
| 3:56:45| So next, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| What's the next page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14207)|
| 3:56:48| Okay, 5-6, Article V, Section 5.4b, building materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14208)|
| 3:56:54| Aluminum, steel, and other metal sidings does not apply to CN or O districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14214)|
| 3:57:02| This restriction does not include metal architectural wall panels, for example, dry design panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14222)|
| 3:57:10| These materials are not permitted in industrial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14230)|
| 3:57:16| but they're being somehow permitted in the CN and office district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14236)|
| 3:57:21| which are right up against our neighborhoods, our residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14241)|
| 3:57:25| And it would seem to us that it would make sense if you're not going to allow them in certain districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14245)|
| 3:57:30| you wouldn't allow them in the districts that are closest to the residential dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14250)|
| 3:57:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14256)|
| 3:57:37| Comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| And this came from our consultants, and I asked them why that restriction was not in CN and O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14259)|
| 3:57:46| And they said that their reasoning was economic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14266)|
| 3:57:51| that because of the smaller scale of structures in the O and CN districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14271)|
| 3:57:59| the need to do it at an economically viable cost was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14279)|
| 3:58:05| and that these materials are somewhat less expensive than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14285)|

| 3:58:14| and the neighborhood commercial, but as the council feels otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14294)|
| 3:58:17| we would certainly be open to removing that permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14297)|
| 3:58:24| How does council feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14304)|
| 3:58:25| Any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14305)|
| 3:58:28| I'm trying to follow the logic of that and the economies of scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14308)|
| 3:58:32| So if you're building something big in a commercial zone, you can't use cheap materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14312)|
| 3:58:37| but if you're building something small on a CN or office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14317)|
| 3:58:43| next to people's homes, you can use cheap materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14323)|
| 3:58:47| Cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14327)|
| 3:58:48| Less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14328)|
| 3:58:49| We deserve no better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14329)|
| 3:58:51| And again, this came from the consultants, so I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14331)|
| 3:58:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14335)|
| 3:58:56| You're not married to it one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14336)|
| 3:58:58| One way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14338)|
| 3:58:59| I'm not married to any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14339)|
| 3:59:01| Figuratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14341)|
| 3:59:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14342)|
| 3:59:03| You're willing to fight for some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14343)|
| 3:59:05| Hopefully we'll all be married when we're finished with all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14345)|
| 3:59:10| But architectural panels are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14350)|
| 3:59:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14352)|
| 3:59:13| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14353)|
| 3:59:14| The Thomas building has metal architectural panels there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14354)|
| 3:59:20| Automatic change has them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14360)|
| 3:59:23| And these materials were vetted by the AIA and they were comfortable with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14363)|
| 3:59:34| I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14374)|
| 3:59:36| Well, the question is not are you comfortable with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14376)|
| 3:59:39| Not allowed in any district except the districts that are buffering residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14379)|
| 3:59:49| It's just odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14389)|
| 3:59:51| It's illogical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14391)|
| 3:59:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14392)|
| 3:59:53| What's good for the goose is good for the gander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14393)|
| 3:59:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14395)|
| 3:59:56| I mean, we're going to have limitations on materials next to people's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14396)|
| 4:00:01| most people's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14401)|
| 4:00:03| Most people, majority, own one dwelling and that is their biggest investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14403)|
| 4:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14413)|
| 4:00:14| So the question is whether we remove does not apply to C and O districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14414)|
| 4:00:18| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14418)|
| 4:00:22| Were there conversations about this on the stakeholders committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14422)|
| 4:00:25| There were conversations about it on the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14425)|
| 4:00:28| I don't know that anyone expressed your level of passion for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14428)|
| 4:00:32| So I don't, I mean, I don't have an objection if there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14432)|
| 4:00:37| I do remember the exact discussion that Mr. Green let us know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14437)|
| 4:00:44| It came up and we were sort of relying on AIA to help guide some of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14444)|
| 4:00:52| Does anybody else who hasn't spoken on this from the crowd want to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14452)|
| 4:01:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14460)|
| 4:01:01| So do you want to make a motion or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14461)|
| 4:01:03| So, I mean, I'm considering a motion to strike B to the part that says does not apply to C and O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14463)|
| 4:01:11| So that the standard is on the building materials is the same across all commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14471)|
| 4:01:20| Somebody's applauding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14480)|
| 4:01:22| I have one fan, one supporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14482)|
| 4:01:25| We have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14485)|
| 4:01:26| There were at least three people who clapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14486)|
| 4:01:28| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14488)|
| 4:01:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14489)|
| 4:01:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14490)|
| 4:01:31| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14491)|
| 4:01:33| Did she make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14493)|
| 4:01:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14495)|
| 4:01:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14496)|
| 4:01:37| So there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14497)|
| 4:01:38| This is on page 5-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14498)|
| 4:01:40| We're on B2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14500)|
| 4:01:44| And the motion is to strike does not apply to C and O districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14504)|
| 4:01:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14514)|
| 4:01:55| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14515)|
| 4:01:57| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14517)|
| 4:02:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14520)|
| 4:02:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14521)|
| 4:02:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14522)|
| 4:02:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14523)|
| 4:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14524)|
| 4:02:05| So it passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14525)|
| 4:02:11| Okie doke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14531)|
| 4:02:13| What's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14533)|
| 4:02:18| Other issues on 5, Article 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14538)|
| 4:02:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14544)|
| 4:02:25| So now we move on to Article 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14545)|
| 4:02:31| Industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14551)|
| 4:02:33| It goes from 6-1 to 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14553)|
| 4:02:38| It's a small one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14558)|
| 4:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14560)|
| 4:02:41| Gerald, anything you want to point out to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14561)|
| 4:02:46| On page 6-2, Section 6.4A, the IMU Industrial Mixed Use District does have design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14566)|
| 4:02:58| This revision clarifies the expansion that must occur before that expansion area has to comply with the design standards for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14578)|
| 4:03:08| industrial mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14588)|
| 4:03:11| And that's 30% that the – it clarifies that these design standards apply to any new construction and to any addition that exceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14591)|
| 4:03:25| 30% of the square footage of the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14605)|
| 4:03:29| I'm thinking that 30% adding a third of the building's square footage, that's when – that seemed an appropriate time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14609)|
| 4:03:37| require compliance with the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14617)|
| 4:03:39| Again, only for the addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14619)|
| 4:03:40| It would not apply to the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14620)|
| 4:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14625)|
| 4:03:47| Any questions about that from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14627)|
| 4:03:52| In Table 6-2, the – or actually 6-1, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14632)|
| 4:03:58| Yes, 6-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14638)|
| 4:03:59| The rear setback was increased for industrial buildings that abut a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14639)|
| 4:04:06| It was increased from 25 feet to 50 feet for the IG district and from 35 feet to 50 feet for the IH district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14646)|
| 4:04:15| Similar to the setbacks on the side setback when they abutted a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14655)|
| 4:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14664)|
| 4:04:25| Nick Delladotti, Polson Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14665)|
| 4:04:28| Just when we were looking at on Page 6.2, Page 6.2, Section 6-4A, we were just talking about that 30% rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14668)|
| 4:04:37| There's a little bit of an ambiguity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14677)|
| 4:04:39| It says, which exceeds 30% or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14679)|
| 4:04:42| Why don't we just say to a structure of 30% or more because that means it has to be 31%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14682)|
| 4:04:50| I don't know where – I'm not sure where the break point is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14690)|
| 4:04:52| It seems like the wording gets you a little tripper in there if you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14692)|
| 4:04:56| of this code of 30% or more of the existing structure, square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14696)|
| 4:05:01| shows that you start this process of coming under the standard at 30, not 31 or some other number beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14701)|
| 4:05:10| Thank you, Mr. Grint or Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14710)|
| 4:05:18| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14718)|
| 4:05:19| Exceeds is the same as or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14719)|
| 4:05:23| So I would say just get rid of or more so that it says, as of the effective date of this code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14723)|
| 4:05:29| that exceed 30% of the existing structure, square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14729)|
| 4:05:35| And it should be exceeds with an S?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14735)|
| 4:05:39| Actually, he was saying that it should – you're saying if it's greater than 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14739)|
| 4:05:45| It needs – which is not what Mr. Delma –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14745)|
| 4:05:48| It's not 30 and greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14748)|
| 4:05:50| It's not 30 and greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14750)|
| 4:05:51| It exceeds 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14751)|
| 4:05:52| So if it's more than 30%, that's what – that's what they're trying to say here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14752)|
| 4:06:00| That provides the clarity, I think, for my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14760)|
| 4:06:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14766)|
| 4:06:07| Mr. McWhorter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14767)|
| 4:06:09| I'd just like to point out that this is another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14769)|
| 4:06:11| I think, in my mind, this conflicts with what Article 17 says now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14771)|
| 4:06:16| because this – this Article 17 has a – makes all additions and expansions to prior legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14776)|
| 4:06:27| nonconforming structures subject to BZA approval subject to a set of criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14787)|
| 4:06:34| which is a – which is a different process in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14794)|
| 4:06:38| So this is just a different type of trigger that, to me –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14798)|
| 4:06:42| I think they can be made to conform to line up, but it's just confusing to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14802)|
| 4:06:47| when you have this 30% trigger in a separate mechanism in Article 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14807)|
| 4:06:51| that says something different broadly across the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14811)|
| 4:06:55| And I think this is something that needs to be thought about together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14815)|
| 4:07:01| Article 6 here is talking about conformity – conforming buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14821)|
| 4:07:05| Everything is conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14825)|
| 4:07:07| Everything is conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14827)|
| 4:07:08| Article 17 is nonconforming, and it tells you how you can add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14828)|
| 4:07:12| or expand your nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14832)|
| 4:07:17| So if Article 17 says you can expand your nonconforming use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14837)|
| 4:07:22| or build on to your nonconforming building, if you hit 30% –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14842)|
| 4:07:27| well, if you exceed 30%, then these design standards come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14847)|
| 4:07:34| They're not in conflict with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14854)|
| 4:07:36| That just needs to be clarified in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14856)|
| 4:07:39| I mean, that's not – that's – I just think that's a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14859)|
| 4:07:44| there's a wordsmithing need there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14864)|
| 4:07:46| Because that says the design standards apply to new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14866)|
| 4:07:52| and any additions existing as of the effective date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14872)|
| 4:07:56| That exceeds 30% or more any additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14876)|
| 4:07:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14879)|
| 4:08:00| So does it need to say conforming in here or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14880)|
| 4:08:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14882)|
| 4:08:03| Is it clear to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14883)|
| 4:08:04| Article 17 is totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14884)|
| 4:08:05| It's about nonconforming buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14885)|
| 4:08:08| And that gives – Article 17 describes when and how you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14888)|
| 4:08:13| add on to your nonconforming building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14893)|
| 4:08:16| That doesn't mean you stay in Article 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14896)|
| 4:08:20| You still have to go back, if you're adding on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14900)|
| 4:08:23| to build to these design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14903)|
| 4:08:26| They just – they're two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14906)|
| 4:08:29| For the addition of the whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14909)|
| 4:08:32| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14912)|
| 4:08:34| I just think the words aren't – don't clearly say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14914)|
| 4:08:38| I'm just pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14918)|
| 4:08:40| We can take a look at it and make sure that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14920)|
| 4:08:42| we'll go through with Christina and Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14922)|
| 4:08:45| to make sure that it says what it is intended to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14925)|
| 4:08:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14930)|
| 4:08:51| It's not uncommon for us on a day-to-day basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14931)|
| 4:08:53| to have to explain to applicants because even our current zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14933)|
| 4:08:58| is difficult to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14938)|
| 4:09:01| And we work with it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14941)|
| 4:09:03| We understand that it's going to take education on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14943)|
| 4:09:08| So what you're saying this means is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14948)|
| 4:09:10| so if you've got a – you have a conforming structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14950)|
| 4:09:13| that meets these design criteria, that's conforming structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14953)|
| 4:09:23| I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14963)|
| 4:09:24| That meets the design – I mean, that's not out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14964)|
| 4:09:27| in my opinion, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14967)|
| 4:09:30| Table 17 does not reference design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14970)|
| 4:09:33| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14973)|
| 4:09:34| But you're suggesting that 6.4A deals only with conforming structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14974)|
| 4:09:43| And what I'm suggesting to you is there's not any existing structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14983)|
| 4:09:48| that conform to the requirements of Table 6.2, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14988)|
| 4:09:55| I understand what you're saying now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14995)|
| 4:09:57| I understand what you're saying because essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14997)|
| 4:09:59| if this passes as is, everything out there is going to become nonconforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=14999)|
| 4:10:03| because it doesn't meet the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15003)|
| 4:10:05| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15005)|
| 4:10:06| The standard netting mill meets these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15006)|
| 4:10:08| And so now you've got two different mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15008)|
| 4:10:10| and it's unclear what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15010)|
| 4:10:13| So I see what you're saying now and I still would say that Article 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15013)|
| 4:10:18| is going to tell you the rules for expansion of your building or your use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15018)|
| 4:10:23| and you still have to come back to Article 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15023)|
| 4:10:28| Article 6 is for any – I think it needs a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15028)|
| 4:10:33| But I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15033)|
| 4:10:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15035)|
| 4:10:36| So they'll take another look just to see if there's a way to make it clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15036)|
| 4:10:40| Amy, do you want to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15040)|
| 4:10:42| Again, I want to say this is an area that we spent a lot of time with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15042)|
| 4:10:46| I think Mr. McWhorter is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15046)|
| 4:10:48| There isn't a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15048)|
| 4:10:50| Maybe standard netting mill would fit with the IMU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15050)|
| 4:10:53| but if you look at the East Tennessee Community Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15053)|
| 4:10:57| and their – I can never say the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15057)|
| 4:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15060)|
| 4:11:02| They couldn't – they had a lot of trouble doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15062)|
| 4:11:06| It involved closing streets or doing a lot of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15066)|
| 4:11:10| And they were dealing more with parking and access, not their issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15070)|
| 4:11:13| Again –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15073)|
| 4:11:15| Sorry to get into this, but their access with the standard netting mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15075)|
| 4:11:18| was a lot of how to provide the parking they thought it needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15078)|
| 4:11:22| and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15082)|
| 4:11:24| Not so much compliance with the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15084)|
| 4:11:27| but compliance with the developers' desires for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15087)|
| 4:11:31| But there wasn't a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15091)|
| 4:11:33| It was – or a budget, and they still struggled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15093)|
| 4:11:36| But anyway, again, this is part of the issue with the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15096)|
| 4:11:40| We took a lot of look at the very first draft of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15100)|
| 4:11:44| There was a lot of properties zoned IMU, which was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15104)|
| 4:11:49| Second draft of the ordinance, there was design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15109)|
| 4:11:53| instituted for IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15113)|
| 4:11:55| So then, all of a sudden, it wasn't okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15115)|
| 4:11:57| because industries, manufacturers, they don't want pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15117)|
| 4:12:02| If you look at Riley Foods over on Sutherland, they're gated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15122)|
| 4:12:07| If you look at any manufacturer in town, they have gates, locks, securities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15127)|
| 4:12:12| They don't want pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15132)|
| 4:12:14| So we had spent a lot of time going through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15134)|
| 4:12:18| and getting the IMUs changed to a more compatible IG and IH,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15138)|
| 4:12:25| and that was in the second, third, and finally in the fourth draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15145)|
| 4:12:30| of the map, got those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15150)|
| 4:12:32| Second issue, also, we have made a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15152)|
| 4:12:36| We would like to see the maximum building heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15156)|
| 4:12:41| in the IGs and IH be raised to the same level as the IRD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15161)|
| 4:12:48| Most manufacturers do their R&D on-site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15168)|
| 4:12:53| versus they don't build another R&D plant somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15173)|
| 4:12:57| They usually do it as a component of their existing manufacturer's facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15177)|
| 4:13:02| And there is also a trend in industrial design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15182)|
| 4:13:05| as land costs get more expensive and the like to go vertical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15185)|
| 4:13:09| So that's why you see in an R&D, which is a future manufacturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15189)|
| 4:13:15| why you see that increased height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15195)|
| 4:13:17| and we would like to see that in IG and IH| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15197)|
| 4:13:21| to give all our manufacturers the opportunity to do R&D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15201)|
| 4:13:25| and remain competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15205)|
| 4:13:27| So hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15207)|
| 4:13:28| So you're suggesting under maximum building height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15208)|
| 4:13:31| this is on page 6-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15211)|
| 4:13:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15213)|
| 4:13:34| Maximum building height for IG and IH?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15214)|
| 4:13:38| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15218)|
| 4:13:39| To do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15219)|
| 4:13:40| Go up to 90 like it is in R&D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15220)|
| 4:13:46| So we'd move from 50 feet to 90 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15226)|
| 4:13:49| As it is in R&D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15229)|
| 4:13:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15231)|
| 4:13:52| Considering that a manufacturer is not going to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15232)|
| 4:13:55| it's going to be probably an R&D situation that they're going to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15235)|
| 4:14:01| to get to 90 or if they were competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15241)|
| 4:14:05| if they needed to expand versus expanding out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15245)|
| 4:14:09| or expanding into a new green space out in an adjacent county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15249)|
| 4:14:14| it would allow them to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15254)|
| 4:14:16| And Raleigh Foods was among the ones that asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15256)|
| 4:14:20| for future expansion for that to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15260)|
| 4:14:24| Not the very next one, but future beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15264)|
| 4:14:28| Where is that located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15268)|
| 4:14:29| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15269)|
| 4:14:30| Ms. Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15270)|
| 4:14:31| It is on Minot Avenue behind Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15271)|
| 4:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15274)|
| 4:14:35| And then near the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15275)|
| 4:14:37| Behind Railroad Sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15277)|
| 4:14:38| Behind Railroad Sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15278)|
| 4:14:39| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15279)|
| 4:14:40| You can't even see it back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15280)|
| 4:14:43| So I'd make a motion to change IG and IH to 90 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15283)|
| 4:14:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15287)|
| 4:14:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15290)|
| 4:14:51| So that's page 6-1 on table 6-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15291)|
| 4:14:55| Just ask Mr. Green if he had any comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15295)|
| 4:14:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15298)|
| 4:15:00| I'm entirely comfortable with that, Ms. Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15300)|
| 4:15:04| Amy, she and I have discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15304)|
| 4:15:09| I just wanted to make sure that we discussed heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15309)|
| 4:15:14| in the industrial districts with the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15314)|
| 4:15:17| We didn't talk about additional heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| I want to make sure that Mr. Swanson is comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15319)|
| 4:15:22| with that provision at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15322)|
| 4:15:28| I'm comfortable with the provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15328)|
| 4:15:30| My concern is I'm not sure whether this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15330)|
| 4:15:33| that was reviewed at the MPC level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15333)|
| 4:15:37| We discussed the heights permitted, the proposed heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15337)|
| 4:15:40| but at that time there was no discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15340)|
| 4:15:42| of increasing the heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15342)|
| 4:15:44| So we did discuss the height as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15344)|
| 4:15:47| You're doubling the height at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15347)|
| 4:15:51| I'm a little concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15351)|
| 4:15:53| That's why I'm asking for your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15353)|
| 4:15:55| I don't want something to push us back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15355)|
| 4:15:57| to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15357)|
| 4:15:59| I don't want to go backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15359)|
| 4:16:01| Actually, I talked to Amy and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15361)|
| 4:16:04| if we can't make this work here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15364)|
| 4:16:06| it would be the first item on our proposed amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15366)|
| 4:16:09| to the code because I think it's a very reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15369)|
| 4:16:13| Just quite honestly, Ms. Nolan did bring it up to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15373)|
| 4:16:19| previously, but it was after the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15379)|
| 4:16:22| considered this, and I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15382)|
| 4:16:26| I forgot our discussion, and so it wasn't in the revised draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15386)|
| 4:16:31| and it was not discussed by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15391)|
| 4:16:34| To me, when you double the height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15394)|
| 4:16:36| and you haven't considered really increasing the height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15396)|
| 4:16:39| when you took it before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15399)|
| 4:16:41| that throws it into a situation where I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15401)|
| 4:16:45| that someone later on in litigation may learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15405)|
| 4:16:51| that it was not properly adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15411)|
| 4:16:53| Well, I can make this commitment to the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15413)|
| 4:16:56| and to Amy and to the Chamber of Commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15416)|
| 4:17:01| that the first month after this is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15421)|
| 4:17:03| I'll have this amendment before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15423)|
| 4:17:06| Clearly, that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15426)|
| 4:17:11| All I need you to do is adopt the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15431)|
| 4:17:13| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15433)|
| 4:17:14| Were you speaking to that issue or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15434)|
| 4:17:16| I guess I would speak to that issue in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15436)|
| 4:17:19| I mean, we're making a lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15439)|
| 4:17:20| We may be dealing with a whole new map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15440)|
| 4:17:23| I mean, would it not be safer to send it back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15443)|
| 4:17:27| That's what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15447)|
| 4:17:28| I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15448)|
| 4:17:29| Not just on the one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15449)|
| 4:17:30| Not just this issue, but we're changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15450)|
| 4:17:33| A lot's been changed from when MPC approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15453)|
| 4:17:35| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15455)|
| 4:17:37| I mean, if we had to list the number of changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15457)|
| 4:17:39| it would be pretty lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15459)|
| 4:17:41| I've been trying to watch this pretty closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15461)|
| 4:17:43| and frankly, I haven't seen anything up until now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15463)|
| 4:17:47| which I have felt that MPC...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15467)|
| 4:17:49| I couldn't make a really good argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15469)|
| 4:17:51| that MPC considered this issue, whichever way they went on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15471)|
| 4:17:55| We could show on the record that MPC considered this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15475)|
| 4:17:58| This is really the first issue that, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15478)|
| 4:18:01| that we're considering doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15481)|
| 4:18:05| that I would be uncomfortable with saying MPC has considered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15485)|
| 4:18:09| Having watched that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15489)|
| 4:18:10| Even with significant changes to the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15490)|
| 4:18:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15492)|
| 4:18:13| You know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15493)|
| 4:18:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15494)|
| 4:18:15| Because MPC considered those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15495)|
| 4:18:17| But we're not into maps yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15497)|
| 4:18:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15499)|
| 4:18:20| But when we get there, I'll look for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15500)|
| 4:18:23| But I think MPC did consider those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15503)|
| 4:18:27| And having watched this even more closely than Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15507)|
| 4:18:30| I concur with him that all the issues that we've addressed thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15510)|
| 4:18:34| with the exception of this increased height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15514)|
| 4:18:36| in the industrial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15516)|
| 4:18:37| the Planning Commission heard those comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15517)|
| 4:18:40| or discussed that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15520)|
| 4:18:45| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15525)|
| 4:18:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15526)|
| 4:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15527)|
| 4:18:48| So, Mr. Delvapi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15528)|
| 4:18:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15529)|
| 4:18:50| Dumb addition suggestion on IG and IH| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15530)|
| 4:18:52| that they were just talking about, Ms. Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15532)|
| 4:18:54| What if we had 50 foot as the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15534)|
| 4:18:56| and then had a semicolon input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15536)|
| 4:18:58| with additional height up to 90 feet upon plan review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15538)|
| 4:19:01| or something that got that item looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15541)|
| 4:19:04| by at least MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15544)|
| 4:19:06| something that would look at impacts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15546)|
| 4:19:08| I don't know if that helps you or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15548)|
| 4:19:10| but it would be ordinarily 50 with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15550)|
| 4:19:12| You know, if you're putting...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15552)|
| 4:19:14| If you're putting fires and fiery things up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15554)|
| 4:19:16| it's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15556)|
| 4:19:17| If you're putting an R&D lab, who cares?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15557)|
| 4:19:19| You know, kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15559)|
| 4:19:20| Yeah, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15560)|
| 4:19:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15561)|
| 4:19:22| That's just a different method of getting to the same point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15562)|
| 4:19:24| You know, I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15564)|
| 4:19:26| but I just don't think that's an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15566)|
| 4:19:28| that MPC considered that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15568)|
| 4:19:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15570)|
| 4:19:31| I'm not arguing with you so much as trying to maybe...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15571)|
| 4:19:33| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15573)|
| 4:19:34| Just withdraw it and we'll come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15574)|
| 4:19:36| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15576)|
| 4:19:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15577)|
| 4:19:38| I would just like to speak to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15578)|
| 4:19:40| Councilman Stair said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15580)|
| 4:19:42| There have been other significant changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15582)|
| 4:19:44| maybe have not gotten to them yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15584)|
| 4:19:46| but, for instance, in Draft 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15586)|
| 4:19:48| a bunch of things were added to the matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15588)|
| 4:19:50| to the use matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15590)|
| 4:19:51| which I'm sure were not discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15591)|
| 4:19:53| or not discussed to my knowledge at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15593)|
| 4:19:57| including drug and alcohol rehab inpatient centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15597)|
| 4:20:01| in the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15601)|
| 4:20:03| That just showed up in 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15603)|
| 4:20:06| Outdoor amusement, that just showed up in 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15606)|
| 4:20:11| Rental cars, enclosed, whatever enclosed means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15611)|
| 4:20:15| that just showed up in 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15615)|
| 4:20:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15622)|
| 4:20:23| Since it didn't get discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15623)|
| 4:20:25| I think I'll withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15625)|
| 4:20:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15627)|
| 4:20:28| So we're going to withdraw this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15628)|
| 4:20:30| but know that this will be one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15630)|
| 4:20:33| We keep saying this will be a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15633)|
| 4:20:35| There will be things that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15635)|
| 4:20:38| So we'll follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15638)|
| 4:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15640)|
| 4:20:41| Thanks, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15641)|
| 4:20:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15642)|
| 4:20:43| Other things in Article 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15643)|
| 4:20:46| The final revision, not major revision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15646)|
| 4:20:51| was clarification of the design material restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15651)|
| 4:20:56| in the IMU district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15656)|
| 4:20:58| And, again, this was based on input by AIA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15658)|
| 4:21:01| and it was discussed at length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15661)|
| 4:21:03| by the Planning Commission in the workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15663)|
| 4:21:05| This is 6-2B, building material restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15665)|
| 4:21:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15672)|
| 4:21:13| Lots of discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15673)|
| 4:21:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15674)|
| 4:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15676)|
| 4:21:17| Anything else on 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15677)|
| 4:21:20| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15680)|
| 4:21:21| Mayor, so I want to jump just for a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15681)|
| 4:21:24| for a point of clarification to Article 17, nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15684)|
| 4:21:28| So in the first sentence in 17.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15688)|
| 4:21:34| Director Green, if you could please give me clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15694)|
| 4:21:37| Is this saying that upon the date of the approval of RECODE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15697)|
| 4:21:43| that any existing structures which would be nonconforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15703)|
| 4:21:48| will be subject to the provisions that are passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15708)|
| 4:21:54| This subject to the provisions of this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15714)|
| 4:21:57| for nonconforming structures, land, and usage, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15717)|
| 4:22:01| And, again, these provisions are the same as in the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15721)|
| 4:22:12| All of this in blue, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15732)|
| 4:22:14| They can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15734)|
| 4:22:15| Those nonconforming use can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15735)|
| 4:22:19| In some ways, we've made it more liberal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15739)|
| 4:22:22| for nonconforming uses in that you can close your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15742)|
| 4:22:26| but advertise it for sale as that business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15746)|
| 4:22:29| and if it's a nonconforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15749)|
| 4:22:31| you can sell it to me five years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15751)|
| 4:22:34| and I can open that business as long as you market it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15754)|
| 4:22:39| for that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15759)|
| 4:22:40| And we've made, to the extent we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15760)|
| 4:22:44| we've made it easier to make the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15764)|
| 4:22:51| from the current code and standards to the new code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15771)|
| 4:22:56| and maintain your business, your structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15776)|
| 4:22:58| your land is nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15778)|
| 4:23:02| So are you saying that those are going to, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15782)|
| 4:23:05| be grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15785)|
| 4:23:07| Grandfathered in, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15787)|
| 4:23:08| The nonconforming uses, nonconforming structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15788)|
| 4:23:11| they can be sold, they can be transferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15791)|
| 4:23:14| they can be marketed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15794)|
| 4:23:16| As long as they are actively marketed, again, for that use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15796)|
| 4:23:19| they can be continued for 100 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15799)|
| 4:23:25| as long as they can operate continuously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15805)|
| 4:23:29| and do not close for more than six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15809)|
| 4:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15812)|
| 4:23:33| Because I kind of felt like when, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15813)|
| 4:23:36| I can't remember your name, gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15816)|
| 4:23:38| sitting in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15818)|
| 4:23:39| Mr. McWhorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15819)|
| 4:23:40| Mr. McWhorter, that you were indicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15820)|
| 4:23:41| that that was not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15821)|
| 4:23:45| I'm not suggesting that this draft doesn't protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15825)|
| 4:23:50| nonconforming uses and structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15830)|
| 4:23:52| I'm just suggesting that there's a lot of ambiguity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15832)|
| 4:23:56| in this current revision that needs to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15836)|
| 4:24:01| and provisions of Article 17 that need to be conformed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15841)|
| 4:24:06| with other code provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15846)|
| 4:24:08| some of which we've already looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15848)|
| 4:24:10| The 30% rule on the industrial design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15850)|
| 4:24:14| the 30% rule on the commercial design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15854)|
| 4:24:19| I just think those things need to be integrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15859)|
| 4:24:22| And, again, I don't think we have huge substantive issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15862)|
| 4:24:25| I just think there's some work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15865)|
| 4:24:28| Under this A1, 17A1, the difference in 17A1 and 17A2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15868)|
| 4:24:33| I think, is not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15873)|
| 4:24:35| Mr. Green just was talking about the six-month issue in 17C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15875)|
| 4:24:44| It's not clear to me whether part of that provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15884)|
| 4:24:47| talks about nonconforming structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15887)|
| 4:24:49| Another part of it talks about nonconforming uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15889)|
| 4:24:52| The prior draft protected nonconforming structures and uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15892)|
| 4:24:58| even when there was a vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15898)|
| 4:25:00| so long as they were being actively marketed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15900)|
| 4:25:04| This provision seems to do away with actively marketed protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15904)|
| 4:25:09| That's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15909)|
| 4:25:11| There's just a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15911)|
| 4:25:13| That's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15913)|
| 4:25:14| I think a lot of issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15914)|
| 4:25:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15916)|
| 4:25:17| I just wanted to get that point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15917)|
| 4:25:19| I know that we'll have some time to go through this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15919)|
| 4:25:21| Thank you for thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15921)|
| 4:25:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15922)|
| 4:25:23| Again, this is another one of those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15923)|
| 4:25:25| where conflicting comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15925)|
| 4:25:28| We've received comments that we should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15928)|
| 4:25:30| and our consultants worked closely with Christina and Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15930)|
| 4:25:34| to draft a nonconforming section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15934)|
| 4:25:36| a new section that tried to address issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15936)|
| 4:25:38| but we received direction that the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15938)|
| 4:25:41| and I'm not speaking of the city as a legal entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15941)|
| 4:25:44| but the community was more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15944)|
| 4:25:46| with our current nonconforming section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15946)|
| 4:25:49| and so took all that work and put it in the trash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15949)|
| 4:25:55| and we've incorporated the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15955)|
| 4:25:58| The Article 17 are the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15958)|
| 4:26:00| Current nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15960)|
| 4:26:01| Nonconforming rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15961)|
| 4:26:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15963)|
| 4:26:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15964)|
| 4:26:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15965)|
| 4:26:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15966)|
| 4:26:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15967)|
| 4:26:08| It's up to your interpretation as to whether the old is better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15968)|
| 4:26:12| than the new would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15972)|
| 4:26:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15973)|
| 4:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15974)|
| 4:26:15| On Article 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15975)|
| 4:26:17| I'm hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15977)|
| 4:26:18| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15978)|
| 4:26:19| Anything else on 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15979)|
| 4:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15981)|
| 4:26:22| Now we're on to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15982)|
| 4:26:23| First, I'd like to note that Article 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15983)|
| 4:26:28| incorporates the South Waterfront Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15988)|
| 4:26:31| and the Cumberland Avenue Forum Codes in their entirety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15991)|
| 4:26:34| and we've received several comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15994)|
| 4:26:36| that this draft is 143 pages longer than Draft 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=15996)|
| 4:26:42| and it is, and the reason is these codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16002)|
| 4:26:45| were incorporated in their entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16005)|
| 4:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16007)|
| 4:26:48| So that's why it's larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16008)|
| 4:26:49| Rather than being integrated throughout the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16009)|
| 4:26:52| in a more, what some may argue, a more logical fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16012)|
| 4:26:57| There are no changes in these codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16017)|
| 4:27:00| There are some staff-recommended revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16020)|
| 4:27:03| and Christina has them up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16023)|
| 4:27:07| The general provisions for these two codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16027)|
| 4:27:10| were inadvertently left out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16030)|
| 4:27:12| so that would be the new Section 7.0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16032)|
| 4:27:14| and if you notice, 7.1, the Cumberland Avenue Forum Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16034)|
| 4:27:19| is called Section .42, and 7.2, the South Waterfront Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16039)|
| 4:27:25| is called Section 4.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16045)|
| 4:27:27| We want to switch those so that 7.1 becomes 4.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16047)|
| 4:27:32| and 7.2 becomes 4.2 to make it more logical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16052)|
| 4:27:36| and I don't know that this is anyone's fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16056)|
| 4:27:39| other than when it got transferred digitally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16059)|
| 4:27:42| these were mixed, and we just printed them that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16062)|
| 4:27:46| Okay, that's number 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16066)|
| 4:27:49| We're up to 3 on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16069)|
| 4:27:52| So number 3 here shows Article 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16072)|
| 4:27:56| and again, it's just switching the order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16076)|
| 4:27:59| adding the general provisions of 7.0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16079)|
| 4:28:03| and then switching the order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16083)|
| 4:28:05| 7.1 will now be South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16085)|
| 4:28:08| and 7.2 will now be the Cumberland Forum-Based Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16088)|
| 4:28:13| Okay, but no changes to the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16093)|
| 4:28:15| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16095)|
| 4:28:17| Yes, so very quickly, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16097)|
| 4:28:20| I know how much work staff and the consultant put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16100)|
| 4:28:23| to trying to integrate these codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16103)|
| 4:28:25| these Forum-Based Codes, into the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16105)|
| 4:28:29| so I appreciate all the work that you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16109)|
| 4:28:32| and then pulling it back out at the community's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16112)|
| 4:28:36| So first of all, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16116)|
| 4:28:38| Very quick question, general provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16118)|
| 4:28:41| is that the same as administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16121)|
| 4:28:44| that is in the current code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16124)|
| 4:28:46| I think it's called administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16126)|
| 4:28:48| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16128)|
| 4:28:49| That would be our intent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16129)|
| 4:28:51| but our forum code administrator answered that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16131)|
| 4:28:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16135)|
| 4:28:56| I'm sorry, what's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16136)|
| 4:28:58| So what is being inserted as general provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16138)|
| 4:29:04| I just want to make sure that's the same as administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16144)|
| 4:29:08| So in my current code, it's section 4.0, general provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16148)|
| 4:29:14| General provisions, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16154)|
| 4:29:16| It is how it is administered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16156)|
| 4:29:18| but it's called general provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16158)|
| 4:29:20| Got it, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16160)|
| 4:29:21| And we won't change the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16161)|
| 4:29:23| Everything's the same, I just want the assurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16163)|
| 4:29:25| Everything's the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16165)|
| 4:29:26| and with your assurance that everything is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16166)|
| 4:29:30| then I would make a motion to approve these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16170)|
| 4:29:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16174)|
| 4:29:35| Okay, we have a motion and a second to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16175)|
| 4:29:39| that those revisions, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16179)|
| 4:29:42| that without changing anything in the actual codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16182)|
| 4:29:46| Is that clear to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16186)|
| 4:29:47| Anyone need to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16187)|
| 4:29:50| That's what I'm saying, the numbering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16190)|
| 4:29:51| that's what we're changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16191)|
| 4:29:52| That's what we're changing, what's showing up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16192)|
| 4:29:55| Okay, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16195)|
| 4:29:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16197)|
| 4:29:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16198)|
| 4:29:59| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16199)|
| 4:30:00| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16200)|
| 4:30:02| Now we're on eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16202)|
| 4:30:03| Great, we're moving right along, record speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16203)|
| 4:30:08| Okay, eight are special purpose and overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16208)|
| 4:30:12| We don't have any staff recommendations for changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190514RecodReview?start=16212)|
