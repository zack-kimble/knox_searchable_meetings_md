| 0:03:52| The first comes near the beginning of the meeting when I read the postponement and consent lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| If you are the applicant and wish to have an item postponed, I will read the postponement list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| I will ask if there are any items to be added to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| You must raise your hand as explained a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| You will then be recognized and asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=254)|

| 0:04:29| The other time you may wish to speak is when the agenda item in which you have an interest is discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| Please take note when the item is announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| I will read the item description and then I may ask for comments from the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| Following any staff comments, I will ask if the applicant is present and if there is any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| At this time, please raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=291)|

| 0:05:24| The selected speaker will then have up to five minutes per side, applicant and opposition, to present their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=324)|
| 0:05:34| The planning commission may grant additional time for presentations of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| Speakers should limit their remarks to the facts of the case and should avoid repeating comments that have been previously presented to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=339)|
| 0:05:48| Because of the number of items we have before us, groups in favor or opposed to an item have been asked to appoint a spokesperson to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=348)|

| 0:34:20| Ms. Bryan, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| Good afternoon, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Thank you for allowing me time to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| My name is Heather Bryan, and I'm the owner of 1629 Stafford Road, and I am located on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2069)|
| 0:34:38| your map there just beside the bump out in 2E20RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2078)|
| 0:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| I wanted to preface my comments today with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| We personally are not opposed to a future subdivision development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| In fact, we support the staff's recommendation to lower the density to 3.45, which seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| to be more appropriate given our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| What I wanted to point out to you today were some restrictions in the temporary easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| that Mr. Davis attached in the case file as Exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| This is referencing the temporary easement between the Biggs family and Ms. Hobson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| The restrictions in that temporary easement are that parcel 111.01, which is the bump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2124)|
| 0:35:32| out there you can see on your screen, that it not be rezoned away from agriculture and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| no building or structure erected on this particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| So our request today to you is that we ask you not to rezone this particular parcel at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| And with that, I would like to reserve the remaining time for any responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Applicant, would you state your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2161)|
| 0:36:09| And Mrs. Bryan is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| There's a deed restriction on that parcel of land in an agreement between Mrs. Hobson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| who lives at 111 on the screen, and the Biggs family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| When Mrs. Hobson granted the Biggs an easement to the Hobson property for said easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2183)|
| 0:36:34| the Biggs family agreed to restrict 1101 for no dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2194)|
| 0:36:43| I'm working with Mrs. Hobson to remove that restriction, which she has the right to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| And that property 11.01 is presently an already zoned planned residential at three units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| I'll yield the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| So this is now to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| I'll make a motion to approve PR plan residential up to 3.45 dwelling units per acre because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| it is consistent with the LDR sector plan class 5 for the Southwest County Sect County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| that includes items 7, 8, and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| We need to do a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| But we need to vote on them one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| So item seven, okay, so we have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, I'm sorry, I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| see whose hand went up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips a second by Commissioner Crowder to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2273)|
| 0:38:03| PR planned residential up to 3.45 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| So 11.01 is already zoned planned residential and the rest of this is agriculture, but Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| Brian wanted us not to zone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| I mean, it already is zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Did I miss something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I just needed some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| I'm looking for any attendees that want to speak if you want if you want to speak or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2317)|
| 0:38:44| address anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| We do have a motion on the floor that we will be voting on if there is no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| Miss Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Yes, we were not aware that that parcel had already been rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| Could you tell us when that took place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Miss Albertson, that would probably be a question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| Hi, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Let me turn on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| It was rezoned as part of the subdivision that Miss Brian lives in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2365)|
| 0:39:38| Hang on just one second and I'll tell you what year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2378)|
| 0:39:50| It was rezoned in 2003 by Wide Horizon Development up to a planned residential up to three dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2390)|
| 0:40:02| units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| Any other question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| I could share with you my screen if you want to see the area that was rezoned back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| Miss Brian, you still have your hand up or do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2419)|
| 0:40:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| I was just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| So, if that was rezoned in 2003 and the applicant was not the owner of the property, I'm confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| at how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| The applicant has to have the permission of the owner in order to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| Again, I was not here in 2003 and don't know how that was verified in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| Now we require a signature from the owner of the property on our rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| forms whereby the owner acknowledges that they are in agreement and consent to the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Again, I was not here in 2003 and don't know how that was verified in 2003, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| our current process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2471)|
| 0:41:22| Miss Brian, does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| Yes, I guess so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| My understanding is that currently that parcel would then sit in violation of the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2489)|
| 0:41:37| And that is an agreement between the property owners and not something that we as the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| Commission or Knox County are involved in in terms of its enforcement and its adherence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| to those private agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| Okay, I don't see any other...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Do you have a second on this motion yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| I think we will go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| The motion is to approve PR up to 3.45 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2544)|

| 0:43:51| You may want to, for clarification purposes, I think Mr. Phillips may have, he said 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| and I think he may have meant 3.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Is he talking, Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2640)|

| 0:46:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| We are going to move on to agenda item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| This is a plan amendment report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| It's going to be, we have two reports, three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| I will be reading both of the reports together and we will vote on three separate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| The applicant is Taylor D. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| The location is the east side of North Broadway, north of Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| Approximate size of the tract is 0.79 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| The present plan and zoning designation is LDR, Low Density Residential, RN, Single Family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| Residential Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| Purpose plan designation is O-Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| The existing land use is vacant parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| Staff recommendation is to deny the O-Office designation because it is not consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2829)|
| 0:47:18| the North City Sector Plan designation and could cause adverse impacts for neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| Also, on the same report, staff recommendation is to deny the O-Office designation since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2850)|
| 0:47:39| it does not meet the criteria for one-year plan amendment and could cause adverse impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| for neighboring residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Also to deny the O-Office zoning because it is not consistent with the North City Sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| Plan designation and could cause adverse impacts for neighboring residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2883)|

| 0:48:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2889)|

| 0:48:23| I sent around an email to the commissioners yesterday that we will be requesting a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| on this matter and requesting a 60-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| I can cite some basis if the commissioners are interested in the reason for the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2915)|
| 0:48:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Mr. Wise, if we do a 60-day postponement, we need to have that vote for Parts A, B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| and C. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Mr. Mashburn, do you have anything that you would like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| I would like to speak in opposition to postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| I fail to see what 60 days is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Mr. Forrester, did you have anything else you wanted to say before we turn it over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Not in regards to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| Again, just based on the staff recommendation of denial on Friday, with everything going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2961)|
| 0:49:30| on with this epidemic, my client is older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| He and I are not able to get together to participate in this meeting at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2974)|
| 0:49:42| I just have an abundance of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| I do not believe he is familiar with Zoom and how to participate routinely in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| meetings rely on guidance and input from my client at times in response to certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| comments and just not being able to have him on the side to address any potential comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| and concerns from either the opposition or from the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| That would be the basis for the request to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| I know that Ms. Carlene Malone has requested a postponement as well and she is in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3009)|
| 0:50:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3018)|

| 1:03:01| three votes. First, the staff recommendation is adopt resolution 4G20SP amending this parcel in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3781)|
| 1:03:11| the East City Sector Plan map to the MDR multifamily residential designation since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3791)|
| 1:03:19| the property is consistent with MDR location criteria and would allow the rezoning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| subsequent remodel of the existing structure. Also, to approve the MDR multifamily residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3804)|

| 1:03:43| rezoning and subsequent remodel of the existing structure. And then the third is approve the RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| general residential neighborhood district zoning because it is located on an arterial and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| surrounded by a mix of uses. This would allow a subsequent remodel of the existing structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| thereby improving the immediate area. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3844)|
| 1:04:13| Ms. Porche, do you have any information about the, oh is that Logan Higgins? Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3853)|

| 1:04:38| Drew Harper is also on, and he is the property owner, and so I don't know if he will have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| comments or not, but if there is anyone who is in opposition, we would love to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| Okay, that's what I was going to call next. Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3889)|
| 1:05:00| I do not see anyone with their hand raised, so Mr. Higgins, do you have anything that you'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| present to the commission? Do you all have the document that we sent in with the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3906)|
| 1:05:19| I'm fairly certain, but which document would that be? So, we sent in a write-up of everything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3919)|
| 1:05:27| we did beforehand, including a pamphlet that we made to hand out and signatures that we got from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| neighbors nearby agreeing with the proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| If you emailed that to commission, then we must certainly receive that. Okay, well, I will talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3943)|
| 1:05:52| through it real brief, very briefly. Basically, we met with MPC first and foremost to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3952)|
| 1:06:00| the plan was in line with MPC's recommendations. We met with neighbors in the area. We made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3960)|
| 1:06:11| pamphlet and handed it out door to door and discussed the change with the immediate neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| There's a high school across the street, and we made contact with the principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| talked to her about it, and she was very much in support. And then we met with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| neighborhood association and discussed with them and had full support from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| So, with that document, we also have signatures from neighbors and from the neighborhood board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=3993)|
| 1:06:43| in support of the project. So, we didn't expect anyone to have any opposition, but we definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| did a lot of hard work to make sure that everyone was aware of the change and that if there were any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| concerns, they were addressed. Thank you. You've done an excellent job with that, as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=4014)|

| 1:07:39| rezoning and subsequent remodel of the existing structure. Great. Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=4059)|

| 1:24:58| You want to turn your video on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| I don't know how to do this thing, Jenna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| Cursor down at the bottom of the screen and over to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| We've turned off Commissioner Graf's video because he appears to have poor internet reception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| which is somewhat common and not so I've heard. Okay. Video and it enhances his connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5120)|
| 1:25:28| and we're able to hear him, but we can't see him. Thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5128)|

| 1:26:26| The applicant is Knoxville, Knox County Planning. The location is west of Ed Schaus Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5186)|

| 1:27:14| three motions and three votes on this. The staff recommendation is number one to adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5234)|
| 1:27:22| resolution 4K20SP amending the Northwest City Sector Plan to HI Heavy Industrial as it is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5242)|
| 1:27:33| extension of the IH designation to the west because of the changes in development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| in this area with more industrial uses locating in the area and demand for industrial land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| increasing. And since the transportation and utility infrastructure in the area is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| appropriate for industrial uses. Also, the staff recommendation is to approve, recommends approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5271)|
| 1:28:02| of the HI Heavy Industrial one-year plan land use designation as an extension of the IH designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5282)|
| 1:28:11| to the west because of changes in the development pattern in this area with more industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5291)|

| 1:28:24| and utility infrastructure in the area is appropriate for industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| Third, the staff recommends approval of the IH Heavy Industrial zoning for the property as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| permitted by the Northwest City Sector Plan designation and would permit uses permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| by the C6 zoning assigned by the city's old zoning ordinance. And since the applicant is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5324)|
| 1:28:54| Knoxville-Knox County Planning, I imagine that the applicant is present. Mr. Green, would you like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5334)|
| 1:29:02| Gerald Green, 400 West Main Street, and I'm available to answer questions. I would note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| one unique thing. Two things about this. It was zoned C6 under the old zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5347)|
| 1:29:14| It got changed to IMU with the new zoning ordinance. The owners found that it would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| permit the outdoor storage permitted by the prior C6 zoning and requested IH to allow the full range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| of uses permitted in the C6. For some reason, the second plan and one-year plan amendment did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| follow the old zoning. The second unique feature is that this is a part of the historic Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5370)|
| 1:29:37| Plantation and the owners of that plantation have set up a trust so that development of this portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5377)|
| 1:29:43| of the property will enable them to preserve in perpetuity the old home and the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5383)|
| 1:29:50| old Middlebrook Plantation. So, we're seeing development and conservation historic features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| of the community. Thank you. Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5397)|

| 1:30:34| Phillips? I second the motion. Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| by Commissioner Phillips to adopt the resolution amending Northwest City Sector Plan. Mr. Wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=5441)|

| 1:40:00| That would be you, Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6002)|
| 1:40:08| I have questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| Mr. Harbin, would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| Yes, I'll go briefly to introduce the project here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| I am David Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| The address is 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| I'm a surveyor engineer engaged by Safe Harbor Development, the owner and developer of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6024)|
| 1:40:32| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| This is a rather large piece of property across the street from the other phases of Peyton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| It's anticipated that this will be sold for Goodall Homes to continue their very successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6041)|
| 1:40:48| development on the other side of Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| They've been very successful and want to continue on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| This is a very unique piece of property right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| As you can tell, it's a rather large piece, over 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| The design was a collaboration between myself and Greg Gamble from Gamble Design in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| that's laid out a lot of subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| I think what we have here is a really good design that concentrated and clustered the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| development on the flatter portions away from the sinkholes, the real steep portions, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| the buffers of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| We have reviewed the Planning Commission staff's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| We are in agreement with staff and we urge approval of such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| Mr. Fairstein, did you state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| I'm John Fairstein, 11205 Sam Lee Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6109)|
| 1:41:59| Thank you to the Commission for your service and congratulations to the Gamble family on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| this Peyton Hills Phase 4 development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| My property borders the proposed development on the west side and I submitted a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6128)|
| 1:42:15| April 7th addressing some of my concerns and questions which you should have in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| My next door neighbor, Claire Mount, is also attending today's meeting as an observer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| I only saw any details about this development on Monday, April the 6th, so it's been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6149)|
| 1:42:36| difficult to understand all the impacts, not only in the bigger scale, but also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6156)|
| 1:42:43| my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| The concerns that I have include the Road E entrance safety concerns, our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6165)|
| 1:42:53| protection and privacy concerns, the infrastructure questions, and general questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| related to traffic study and environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| And since I've submitted the letter, I've been contacted by David Harbin, who's online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| here, from Safe Harbor, and John Sexton of Knox County Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6190)|
| 1:43:18| and Taryn Barrett of the Knox TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| We are tentatively scheduled to meet Monday morning at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| on April 13th on the site to discuss the Entrance E, the drainage issues, and the privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6206)|
| 1:43:36| and protection issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| I don't expect Taryn or John Sexton to participate in the drainage and privacy protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6218)|
| 1:43:48| but I would like them to address the Entrance E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| And I'll be happy to go through the highlights of my letter to you and answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| So with that, I reserve the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Taryn, who was the other person you mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6244)|
| 1:44:13| John Sexton, Taryn Barrett, and of course David Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| And I have received some communication via people copying each other on correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| to me, and I'm not sure who all or what their relationship to the project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6266)|
| 1:44:32| Okay, the staff individual that is working on this project is Tom Breschko, and he probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6272)|
| 1:44:40| Yes, I emailed him on March 24th, but I never heard back from him about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| I wanted to get some details about the project, but I know Tom has been copied on several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6286)|
| 1:44:54| of these correspondence that we've exchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| Okay, do you have some specific questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| Tom, do you want to talk to this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6302)|
| 1:45:14| Is Tom Breschko still on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Hi, this is Amy Brooks, and I'm going to, Tom's having some technical difficulties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6316)|
| 1:45:24| so I'm going to turn him on here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6324)|
| 1:45:32| And I apologize, we were away trying to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| Can you repeat the question, or you just want him to provide some additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| Um, I think that, um, Mr. Fairstein had had some correspondence, and he,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6340)|
| 1:45:52| Mr. Fairstein, perhaps you can let us know, you're wanting to know a little more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6352)|
| 1:45:58| on the project, do you have some specific questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| Yes, I have, well, I submitted a letter, which you should have in your packets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6363)|
| 1:46:11| which goes through my specific concerns, and I'll just run through the top level items here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6371)|
| 1:46:20| One of them is the location of the Road E entrance off of Sam Lee Road, and the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6380)|
| 1:46:27| uh, there's, the site distance is, is right now is at 250 feet, but the requirement is 300 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6387)|
| 1:46:35| but more of a safety concern to me is that the entrance E is only 150 feet from our driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6395)|
| 1:46:44| which is already kind of scary, and this, this exaggerates the whole situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| Then my protection and privacy concerns are that, um, lots 38 through 41 and the common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6410)|
| 1:47:00| area associated with that slope downward toward our property, and that's already causing a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| of runoff, and I, and we're worried that the construction won't address the runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6426)|
| 1:47:13| or that it'll aggravate it, and then there, there's some privacy issues about the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6433)|
| 1:47:21| itself. I mean, we're talking about a year or two of, of construction with heavy equipment and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6441)|
| 1:47:30| and, and pile, huge piles of dirt and all the, all the things that are associated with construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6450)|
| 1:47:38| and we'd like to have some sort of privacy fence or some, some thing that will protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| us from all the visuals and the, and the sounds in our property, and then the, another issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6464)|
| 1:47:53| we have a drinking water well, which is located right at the top of our driveway at the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| of Sam Lee Road. We want to ensure that there's not any silting or contamination of the well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6478)|
| 1:48:05| and then lastly, uh, there's a honeybee colony on my property, a managed colony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| on the southwest corner, uh, lot near lot 42, and then there's a bunch of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6491)|
| 1:48:19| questions, which, um, many of the people that I mentioned before have, have addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| like are there going to be streetlights, um, are there plans to widen Sam Lee Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6504)|
| 1:48:30| um, and other issues like that? So, so that's kind of the, the high level, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6510)|
| 1:48:40| presentation of my concerns, and again, this package should be in your, uh, in your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| in your package. Yes, we, I, I remember the email that came through with, with your concerns, and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6527)|
| 1:48:54| and I know that there was some, several, um, emails back to you, and I'm going to first call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6534)|
| 1:49:02| on, um, um, Taryn Barrett, who replied to several of your concerns with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6542)|
| 1:49:14| the, um, um, road being close to your driveway, the site distance, and I think the widening of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6554)|
| 1:49:22| Sam Lee. So, Taryn, could you address those, the, the, uh, traffic concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| Uh, yes, Commissioner, and so, I, you know, in looking at the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6568)|
| 1:49:35| it does say that, uh, for Road A and E, um, that there will need to be a minimum of 300 feet of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6575)|
| 1:49:43| site distance, um, that's required for that, um, in order to, to make that compatible with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6583)|
| 1:49:51| you know, the horizontal and vertical curvature of Sam Lee Road. Um, as far as, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| other constructability issues and, um, lane widening of Sam Lee Road, um, I'd probably go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| ahead and turn that over to Knox County Engineering so that they can, um, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| give more explanation on what they're proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| Yes, and I have, uh, one other issue that I failed to mention was the, uh, setbacks on some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| properties being reduced to 25 feet, but I'll, I'll wait for y'all to comment on that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6620)|
| 1:50:28| I would like to, um, call on, uh, Knox County Engineering to address, um, the issue you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6628)|
| 1:50:36| talking about with regards to, um, the water and explain the, um, the county stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6636)|
| 1:50:47| wastewater, but I'd like to call on the county to, um, uh, address the water issues or weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6647)|
| 1:50:54| on the entire project, actually. Yeah, um, it's lots, uh, 38. Sorry, name and address for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6654)|
| 1:51:05| record, please. Uh, Leola Camera, 205 West Baxter Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6665)|
| 1:51:13| the, uh, the joint, he joins lots 38 through 41. Uh, the grading plan is showing those lots being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6673)|
| 1:51:20| raised to drain towards the streets. It would still get a little bit of runoff from the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| in the back, but this would be less than is currently going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6686)|
| 1:51:33| Okay, and then the other issue related to those same lots is the, and I think Mr. Harvin is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6693)|
| 1:51:40| has discussed this with me, is that you've reduced the setback to 25 feet from the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6700)|
| 1:51:48| 35 feet, and that, that concerns me a little bit because, you know, I, as I sit on my front porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6708)|
| 1:51:56| I'm going to be looking at the, at the back of, uh, four houses. There's a common area down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6716)|
| 1:52:03| which doesn't really affect it, but, um, and I understand how there's some, uh, constrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| with the way the sinkholes and, uh, geography of the topography of the, of the site is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6729)|
| 1:52:17| that encourages that 25 foot setback, but it would really be nice if, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6737)|
| 1:52:26| if that would be back to the normal 35 feet. But the other question is, is does that 25 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6746)|
| 1:52:33| setback include whatever mitigation there is for, uh, for the drainage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6753)|
| 1:52:41| We're a little confused about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| The 25 feet is just a building setback. They can't put a structure closer than 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6766)|
| 1:52:53| Okay, uh, and the other, I'm getting a comment from my neighbor, uh, here about street runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6773)|
| 1:53:01| from Sam Lee Road on their property. Um, that, that's kind of a do issue that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| discuss. Um, I think that's probably something to do with Knox County Engineering. Yeah, you, you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6787)|
| 1:53:15| you can, because that probably doesn't have anything to do with this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| you can contact Knox County Engineering and have them come out and take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| Okay, so I'm looking at the, I'm looking here at the, at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| drawings and I see where the 25 foot peripheral setback line is. And then there's another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6808)|
| 1:53:35| what looks like, I don't know, five, five feet between that and our property. And, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6815)|
| 1:53:44| what does that mean? Are you, are you referencing where the cursor is right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| That's, I can barely see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6830)|
| 1:54:00| No, it's, uh, it's up, up to your right, up here along that line right there. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| keep coming down towards Sam Lee. This little section right where your cursor is, that little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6847)|
| 1:54:14| what looks like a little five foot section there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| Yeah, I think David Harvard may be able to address that, but I'm pretty sure it's, it's the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| the 20 foot line is a drainage easement and then the further line back is probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| peripheral boundary. Um, and David, I did see your hand up. Were you able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6869)|
| 1:54:38| were you wanting to address some of Mr. Fairstein's issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| Sure, if I could take a minute, I would like to do that. First of all, yes, Mr. LeCamere is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| that that other line in there would be a, would be a drainage easement. Uh, that's where we'd put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6888)|
| 1:54:53| the swell in to direct the water. I'll start, I'll start with that. Uh, first of all, most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6893)|
| 1:54:59| as Mr. LeCamere said, most of those lots will drain to the road. What we'll be able to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| to then install a swell along the back of lots 38 through 41 and direct the drainage around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6905)|
| 1:55:12| Mr. Fairstein's property. So I really feel that if he's having drainage problems now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| post-construction, those, those issues should, should go away. Um, I've made a few notes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| from Mr. Fairstein. I'll, I'll address a few of those, uh, right now, uh, since he has brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| them up. Uh, I've gone out there and I am a licensed surveyor as well. I have looked at both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6929)|
| 1:55:37| of these intersections right here and we can meet the 300 foot site. It's either present now or with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| with a little bit of, uh, uh, vegetation removal or, or a little bit of earthwork that's on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| property. We'll be able to, uh, obtain the 300 foot site distance in both, both directions right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6949)|
| 1:55:56| there. Uh, the location chosen for, for, for this road here next to Mr. Fairstein's was chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6956)|
| 1:56:02| because it's right at the top of the hill. It provides the, uh, best place for, uh, uh, site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| distance and, uh, it's, uh, and it, and it, and it will meet the subdivision requirements right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| there. Um, the separation between his driveway, when I get on KGIS is his driveway doesn't come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| out right at the edge of, of, of our property right there. It's actually down about 100, 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| feet if, if the picture's accurate. So, there's, there's fairly good separation between the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6986)|
| 1:56:32| where we're proposing and what Mr. Fairstein's driveway is. I really don't anticipate a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=6992)|
| 1:56:40| there. Um, for the runoff and for the well, right, right now the property is being used to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7000)|
| 1:56:48| to house livestock. That, that will change when we do the, uh, uh, subdivision. Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| livestock does what, what livestock does and I would say there's a probably a better chance of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| of, uh, contamination of wells with what's going on out there right now. Part of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7019)|
| 1:57:06| stormwater ordinance is that we provide water quality post construction. So, our stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7026)|
| 1:57:12| will have to go through, uh, water quality devices prior to being discharged. So, that should also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7032)|
| 1:57:18| provide a post construction that we should have better stormwater runoff than, than what's out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7038)|
| 1:57:24| there right now. Uh, and, and, and for the justification for, for the setback, um, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7044)|
| 1:57:32| Fairstein's house, his actual residence is, is right there in the back corner in the northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| corner right there of his house, uh, where we've, uh, that's next to a, uh, a common area right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7057)|
| 1:57:44| there where we've asked for a reduction of the setback is actually his driveway headed back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7064)|
| 1:57:50| through there. If you look on Google Earth, uh, there's actually a really good stand of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| between us and them right now, uh, and I think that's pretty much on the property line and we'll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| we'll keep that, that, that, that, that protection there that gives him some protection that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| right now. So, with that justification and with just all the limiting factors that we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7087)|
| 1:58:14| you know, we're, we're just at 1.5 units an acre, so we have to sort of cluster the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| and areas that's, that's suitable for that. So, for those reasons right there, I would request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| that the planning commissioners then, uh, approve the plan and also give us the reduction of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7105)|
| 1:58:31| setback in that area right there. Well, that, the other, um, question I would have then is, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7111)|
| 1:58:39| 38 through 41, I see where you're, you're going to address the drainage issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| and I'm assuming that also applies to that little triangular common area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7126)|
| 1:58:53| Yes. There's also going to be a berm or something there? Yes, Mr. Ferrisstein, we'll take that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| the way through the common area and through lot 42 and down to the big pond that's, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| shared on the property. Okay. We'll drive that around. We'll take that. Okay, and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| uh, my other issue again is, is in terms of privacy, is that although there are, as, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7148)|
| 1:59:14| David mentions, there are a string of, a handful of trees along that, the driveway there between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7154)|
| 1:59:22| my property and 38, 39, 40, 41 common area and the 42, um, it's pretty sparse. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7162)|
| 1:59:33| you know, there, it doesn't fill in that area there, and I don't, I think what we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7173)|
| 1:59:40| and I think Mr. Harbin and I are going to meet on Monday morning, is to look at that and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7180)|
| 1:59:46| well, do we need to plant more vegetation there, or does there need to be some other form of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| barrier there, um, you know, so that we're, so that I'm not looking at the development and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| development folks aren't looking particularly at me. It doesn't have to be just a, uh, a perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7197)|
| 2:00:04| opaque barrier, but just some sort of, uh, something to, to shield us from one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7204)|
| 2:00:12| Great. It sounds like, uh, Mr. Harbin is, uh, you're going to be meeting with Mr. Harbin or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7212)|
| 2:00:19| Matt? Yes. Okay. We're going to look at that. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| Go ahead. We have a meeting on Monday morning at 9. We'll be out there with him. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| Okay. Now, the other thing I want to talk about a little bit is about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| Entrance E and the fact that our driveway is, is actually roughly 150 feet, um, over the crest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7234)|
| 2:00:42| the hill. So they've located Entrance E right at the crest of the hill, which will give them at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7242)|
| 2:00:49| least 250 feet on one side and 300 feet sight distance on the other. But the problem is, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7249)|
| 2:00:56| that as you come up traveling west on, uh, Sam Lee Road, there's a very steep hill approaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7256)|
| 2:01:05| uh, Entrance E and people have a tendency as they come around the curve down at the bottom of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7265)|
| 2:01:11| hill to accelerate as they come up Sam Lee Road. And sometimes when they come over the crest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7271)|
| 2:01:18| hill, they're going 40 miles an hour. I mean, the idea of 30 miles an hour on Sam Lee is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7278)|
| 2:01:26| That sounds like something that perhaps you can, um, um, take up with the county and, and perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7286)|
| 2:01:32| have, um, have them station some sheriffs out there for some traffic control. Exactly. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7292)|
| 2:01:39| needs to be something down there and I've asked the, uh, the county people to show up on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| morning at 9-2 to take a look at that. And I don't know what it is, you know, the flashing yellow light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7305)|
| 2:01:52| signage... I will point out, Mr. Fairstein, part of the traffic impact study does address that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7312)|
| 2:02:00| somewhat there. There, there will be advanced intersection warning signs and speed advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| signs posted as part of the, uh, as part of the improvements there along the Sam Lee Road. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| are putting more signage as, as, as included in our traffic impact study. Right. I do understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| that and they were, they were fairly, uh, specific in the, in the, the transportation, uh, plan there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7339)|
| 2:02:29| Um, but nowhere did they address my driveway. Mr. Fairstein, we are, um, we are at, uh, five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7349)|
| 2:02:40| and I know that you have a lot of questions. Um, if any commissioners would like to extend the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7360)|
| 2:02:49| I would entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| Well, there's a lot of issues here and, and, you know, I think we're addressing a lot of them, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7375)|
| 2:03:03| but it's still that, that intersection E is pretty iffy, as, as they mentioned in the, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7383)|
| 2:03:11| transportation. Right. And Knox County will be there meeting with you folks to, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7391)|
| 2:03:18| not going to allow anything to happen that is going to, uh, be outside regulations or, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7398)|
| 2:03:25| have any safety issues. So I'm glad that Knox County will be meeting with you there on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7405)|
| 2:03:32| I want to make sure that, that, that John Sexton or, and or Taryn Barrett, uh, will actually be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7412)|
| 2:03:39| there at nine in the morning. Nick, there's been some talk about simulating this on a computer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| all, but I think you really actually have to be here to see it. Um, cause I've traveled it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7425)|
| 2:03:52| thousands and thousands of times and, and I, I, I know some of the issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7432)|
| 2:03:59| So it's important that they be here at nine AM. Um, I realize it's an inconvenience, but, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7439)|
| 2:04:08| and we'll stay six feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| Yeah. John is here listening to, to the meeting and he will be there at nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| Okay. Okay. Great. And Taryn, is that on your, um, on your schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7455)|
| 2:04:23| It's not just yet, but I will try to make it on my schedule and see what I can do to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7463)|
| 2:04:29| Thank you. Um, and thank you. Yes. And, um, Mr. Fairstein, I know that you also were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7469)|
| 2:04:36| about a honeybee colony and I know, um, you can probably get with Mr. Harbin and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7476)|
| 2:04:48| that honeybee colony is, uh, preserved because they're important for us. We are going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7488)|
| 2:04:55| to commission right now and Scott, uh, Commissioner Smith, you had your hand up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7495)|
| 2:05:02| Um, yeah, I just wanted to, uh, make a couple of comments and, um, you know, this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7502)|
| 2:05:09| this property is wide at a hundred acres. We have 61 acres of common area out of a hundred acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7509)|
| 2:05:18| I mean, I think Mr. Fairstein is extremely fortunate to have, uh, these guys do the kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7518)|
| 2:05:25| of plan that they're doing. Um, I mean, that's 1.5 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7525)|
| 2:05:34| We have a lot of confidence in the county with regard to drainage and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| I have a lot of confidence in the developer to carry through the plan and make sure it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| constructed well. I think the plan is really good. I'm familiar with it. I don't think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7542)|
| 2:05:48| anything that can't be done and it will make a lot of positive changes. And I'd like to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7548)|
| 2:05:56| ahead and make a motion if I could to approve the concept plan subject to the 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7556)|
| 2:06:06| Commissioner Phillips. Yeah. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7566)|

| 2:11:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7886)|
| 2:11:26| I would like to call on Mike Reynolds to give us any additional background on this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7886)|
| 2:11:34| agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| Good afternoon, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| So, at agenda review, we briefly discussed that there's two new conditions attached to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7900)|
| 2:11:47| this staff report that really deal with how they're going to split the property post-construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7907)|
| 2:11:55| and ensuring that the portion of the property that's going to have the self-storage facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7915)|
| 2:12:02| which is shown as parcel A in their plans, that that will be where the ultimate approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7922)|
| 2:12:09| that we're doing now will reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| And parcel B, which goes along East Hill Avenue frontage of the property, will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7931)|
| 2:12:18| include the self-storage approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| It will just allow the downtown boulevard uses that are the new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7940)|
| 2:12:30| And then they can move forward with the development, hopefully, on that portion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| property, doing hopefully something similar to what they're showing and what they provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7954)|
| 2:12:40| to the Planning Commission on Tuesday that showed the multifamily along East Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| But I can pull that up, too, if anybody would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| So, if anybody has any other questions, I'll be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| Commissioner Hill, but before we get to you, Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| Mr. Grubb, I can't remember if I asked you to state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7986)|
| 2:13:06| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7986)|
| 2:13:07| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| Yes, I'll do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7989)|
| 2:13:10| Yes, Jeff Grubb, 2009 Coleto Street, Austin, Texas, 78722.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7990)|
| 2:13:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| Commissioner Hill, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| Commissioner Hill, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| I think Mr. Grubb made wise use of his 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8006)|
| 2:13:33| And I think he has made a very reasonable compromise with the Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| and likewise with the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| So, I think they've worked well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| And with that, I would like to make the motion to approve the indoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| climate-controlled self-storage use with approximately 117,200 square feet of floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8028)|
| 2:13:54| area subject to the six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| And I think that condition five and six were pivotal to moving this project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8037)|
| 2:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| I will second Mr. Hill's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| Yeah, Tim really took all of my words and expressed them very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8059)|
| 2:14:27| I was the one that raised the comments last month about trying to give us a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| of protection up on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| And what they've done is the best they can do, I think, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| And I'm happy that they've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| And I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| And I appreciate Mr. Hill's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8081)|
| 2:14:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8086)|
| 2:14:46| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8086)|
| 2:15:00| Commissioner Eason, your microphone, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8100)|
| 2:15:06| Sorry, start that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| Yeah, I agree with Commissioner Hill and Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| And just wanted to add to that that I'm really pleased to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| a four-story concrete building that the developer has found a new use for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8114)|
| 2:15:19| There's a lot of embodied carbon in a four-story concrete building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| So I'm glad to see that it's not going to be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8122)|
| 2:15:32| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Hill, seconded by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8132)|
| 2:15:39| to approve the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8139)|
| 2:15:46| I do not see any other hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| So let's go ahead and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| I'm going to call the roll on behalf of Mr. Wise for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| Okay, are you, is that Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| It's Amy, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8162)|
| 2:16:03| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8163)|

| 2:17:35| We are on to agenda item number 26, and this is another use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8255)|
| 2:17:44| The applicant is Veterinary Center Development Group, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| The location is the north side of East Emory Road, east of Mays Chapel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8270)|
| 2:17:57| Approximate size of the tract is 2.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| The zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| The proposed use is a veterinary hospital, and the staff recommendation is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8288)|
| 2:18:14| the request for a veterinary hospital that is approximately 5,000 square feet with kennel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8294)|
| 2:18:21| facilities as shown on the development plan, subject to five conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8301)|

| 2:18:39| My name is David Knoll, and I'm here for Jake Watson, and I'm at 1816 –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8319)|

| 2:18:45| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| Do you see that there's opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| So, I wanted to ask the applicant if he would like to go first or the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| I will allow the opposition to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| And so, opposition, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| I see your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| I see that there are two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| Mr. Knoll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| Just myself, to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| So, do you guys want to split your time, or is one person going to take the lead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8350)|
| 2:19:15| How do you want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8359)|

| 2:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| So, you guys have a total of five minutes together for your presentation, so, yes, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8368)|
| 2:19:36| Knoll, go ahead with your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| David Knoll, 1816 Clinch Avenue, Boxville, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8379)|

| 2:19:49| And you can go ahead with your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| The use on review report, and I see your map, and we sent photos, all of the land surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8396)|
| 2:20:05| Dr. Rosenzweig's proposal is either vacant or residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8405)|
| 2:20:11| Mr. Watson had five tracts here of a family farm of 10 acres, and the property immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8411)|
| 2:20:22| to the north is his sister-in-law's property, and Mr. Watson's land was zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8422)|
| 2:20:32| When he approached the metropolitan, when he approached rezoning this, he approached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| it from the point of view of rezoning it for single family residences, and that's reflected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8436)|
| 2:20:46| a little bit on your parcel map information, but it just gives an address information for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8446)|
| 2:20:53| Dr. Rosenzweig's property is single family, and two of the lots, 7508 and 7510, are vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8453)|
| 2:21:03| are unused land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| Mr. Watson's property, you saw on the map there, it's pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| His house, which has been there since 1951, is pretty close to Dr. Rosenzweig's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8469)|
| 2:21:16| 7511 is a single family dwelling, as far as an address, Mr. Watson sold to Joseph Crabtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8476)|
| 2:21:26| You have a statement from Joseph Crabtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| I think you also have our photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| The surrounding land use, you say this, you say everything is either residential or vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8492)|
| 2:21:45| and you say that, correctly, that the property is .4 miles west of Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8505)|
| 2:21:52| That's actually a utility district and a beauty salon when you turn off of Norris Freeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| on Nemory Road, and after that, you don't see any, to our knowledge, use on review of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8517)|
| 2:22:07| agricultural land that's been granted or seen in business until you get to Dry Gap Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8527)|
| 2:22:15| And that's sort of a colloquial out there, you've got some letters from people about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| So it is an area that is traditionally farmland that's been left to be that way until this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8541)|
| 2:22:32| That's Mr. Watson's viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| And it's in your criteria, forgive me, I'm not looking at you, I'm just looking at this paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8555)|
| 2:22:43| but the criteria you say that it's comparable to the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| Well, we just asked the question, what is the character of the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| And it seems to us it's dominantly residential until Dry Gap Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8573)|
| 2:22:59| And you may have a different look at what the character is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8579)|
| 2:23:06| Mr. Watson's house is 88 feet from the property line of Dr. Rosenzwang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8586)|
| 2:23:13| His garage is 33 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| Mr. Watson and his wife are 77 and 76 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| They sold this lot, it gets in Dr. Rosenzwang's lot, it just gets into the history of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8600)|
| 2:23:26| and we sent you the deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| They sold their applicant, Mr. Ridener, this Dr. Rosenzwang's plot on April of 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8607)|
| 2:23:37| you have the deeds, and September of 2018, they also sold the land to Mr. Crabtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8617)|
| 2:23:45| Mr. Ridener came to the Watsons with a house plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| actually drawn up of the house he's going to put on the property that he buys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8630)|
| 2:23:56| That goes on for two years until Mr. Ridener quick claim deeds the property to Dr. Rosenzwang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8636)|
| 2:24:06| The next day, Dr. Rosenzwang and Mr. Ridener petition to give a development request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8646)|
| 2:24:16| to rezone it, or to have issues unreviewed, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| The Watsons are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| They were told by Mr. Ridener there'd be a swimming pool, a storage facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8664)|
| 2:24:31| a garage with his dream home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| So Mr. Watson, I think, he relied on his perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8673)|
| 2:24:42| You have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| Okay, I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| I'll reserve the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8688)|
| 2:24:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| All right, applicant, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| My name is Mr. Rosenzwang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| My address is 10808 Thornton Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8697)|

| 2:25:05| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| I'm going to take all Mr. Noll's points one by one, and then I'll give you my own version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8707)|
| 2:25:14| As far as the zoning goes, I bought this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| It's zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8718)|
| 2:25:19| I think when you look at all the possibilities of what can be built on agricultural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8719)|
| 2:25:26| which I've discussed at length with some of the people that wrote letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| I think a veterinary clinic, a small veterinary clinic in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8730)|
| 2:25:33| is probably the best on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| We have done everything we can to make this a beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| small, community-friendly veterinary hospital that's not going to be intrusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| or have any problems with any of the surrounding homes or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| We have offset this building 45 feet from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| Mr. Noll mentioned that Mr. Watson's house is 88 feet from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8755)|
| 2:26:01| We're putting on, we're adding 45 feet to even get to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8761)|
| 2:26:07| As far as Mr. Crabtree goes, I have tried on numerous occasions to contact him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| to associate this property for two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| Who knows if he is and when he's going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| He lives in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| He has chosen not to call me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| Mr. Noll mentioned letters from surrounding families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| I'd like to bring that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| Only two of these people that submitted letters put contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| I spoke to Jeff Stewart, super nice guy, two German shepherds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8795)|
| 2:26:39| I could hear him in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| When I spoke to him, he said, Mr. Watson was calling him two to three times a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8802)|
| 2:26:46| and telling him that we're rebuilding this commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| It's going to be a big development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| We've got to stop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| And when I spent time with Jeff and I talked to him and told him what was really going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| he said, his words, I don't mind if you put a veterinary hospital there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| He even told me that he would send a rejection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| I don't know if he did that, but you're welcome to call him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8825)|
| 2:27:09| Nice guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| He said, I don't mind if he heard all the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8830)|
| 2:27:14| I also called Alta Floyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| I spoke to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| She said she'd like to see what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8838)|
| 2:27:19| My contractor ran over there with the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| Spent 30 minutes with her and her husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| I called her the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| She has two golden retrievers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| Sadly, one passed away recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| And we showed her how we're placing the building, what the building's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| She also said she would write you and retract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| She is not against us doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| So the only ones that are against us is Mr. Watson and the Staley's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8858)|
| 2:27:45| And the Staley's wrote a letter from the husband, the wife, the son, the daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| and the grandchild with absolutely no way for me to contact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| I spent all day yesterday trying because I think when people actually hear the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8873)|
| 2:27:58| and what we're doing, this is not something that we're trying to do to impose on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8878)|
| 2:28:05| Veterinary medicine is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| We come into a neighborhood, into a community to be part of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| This Staley was writing letters about that we shouldn't be allowed because of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8892)|
| 2:28:18| And we shouldn't be allowed because it's going to be an outdoor bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| And all these things that just are not true that I believe is part of Mr. Watson's campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8901)|
| 2:28:26| to stop us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| And then as far as Mr. Reiner and his relationship with Mr. Watson, no offense, Mr. Knoll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8908)|
| 2:28:34| but that has nothing to do with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| I was not privy to any of their discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| This lot was transferred to my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| It's zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| We are going to do a great thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| It's low-key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| And somebody mentioned traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| We picked this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8929)|
| 2:28:50| It's a four-lane highway with a turning lane with great visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8930)|
| 2:28:54| There's nothing obstructing the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| If clients pull out of it, I'm going to pull out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| We look at the safety of the community and our patients, clients, and employees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8939)|
| 2:29:05| And it's a small little 6,000-foot building, 6 to 10 employees, low-key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8945)|
| 2:29:11| He said there's no outdoor runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8951)|
| 2:29:12| And I will stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| Thank you, Mr. Rosenzweig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| I don't see any other attendees having their hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8962)|
| 2:29:26| Mr. Noel, you did have 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| And do I understand there's other opposition speaking besides me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| Maybe I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| The only other person was Mr. Crabtree, and he said that he would be standing by to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8982)|
| 2:29:42| Well, I would point to the ordinance 4.1016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8982)|
| 2:29:49| The use should be compatible with the character of the neighborhood where it is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| and with the size and locations of the buildings in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| With all due respect to Dr. Rosenzweig, it's a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=8998)|
| 2:30:03| And I'd also point to Regulation 6.50.06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9003)|
| 2:30:09| The approval, in our opinion, would have an adverse impact on the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9009)|
| 2:30:15| because there are two veterinary hospitals in the Hulls Crossroads down past the .4 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9015)|
| 2:30:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9026)|
| 2:30:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| And Mr. Rosenzweig, I see that your hand is up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9027)|
| 2:30:32| Yes, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| As far as the character of the community goes, the closest building to our clinic would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9034)|
| 2:30:41| Mr. Watson's barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| He calls it a garage, but it's a barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| And then across the street from Mr. Watson, on the other side of Mays Chapel, is like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| an eight-stall old wood barn with hay bales, tractors, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9051)|
| 2:30:58| For Mr. Knoll to say that there isn't still a feel of some agricultural in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9058)|
| 2:31:04| if you look the other way, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9064)|
| 2:31:09| So if you look behind Mr. Watson's house, there's a big barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| And when you see the 7409, that's a huge barn with hay bales, with tractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9072)|
| 2:31:18| There is still an agricultural imprint on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| The other thing is, as far as the vet hospitals being in close proximity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| with all due respect, it has nothing to do with my right to put a vet clinic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9091)|
| 2:31:32| So, okay, your time is up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| So we're going to go to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| And the first hand I saw go up was Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9097)|
| 2:31:43| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| I have two questions real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9105)|
| 2:31:49| Number one is for planning staff, or just a general question about a use-on review of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9109)|
| 2:31:53| this type in an ag zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| Does the sector plan it being low density residential have any bearing on that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| Mike, I think that this was yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| Yeah, no, it technically doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| I mean, we have lots of different types of uses that are commercial that can happen in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9125)|
| 2:32:13| residential zones like daycares and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| So the underlying sector plan doesn't matter in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9136)|
| 2:32:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9143)|
| 2:32:24| And my second question, and I'll be quiet, but it's for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9144)|
| 2:32:30| It seems that the position of your building is towards the back of your lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| And it seems like the outside dog restroom area, I guess, or the outside pen is as close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9156)|
| 2:32:44| to Mr. Watson's house as it could possibly be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| I'm just wondering, in an effort to appease Mr. Watson, whose house seems very close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9166)|
| 2:32:54| that, is there a way to put that outside area on another part of the building, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9174)|
| 2:32:59| on the part of the building closer to Emory Road to just avoid disrupting him in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9179)|
| 2:33:06| way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9186)|
| 2:33:06| Or did you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9186)|
| 2:33:11| We can certainly, am I on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9191)|
| 2:33:14| Yes, you were asked a question, so yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9196)|
| 2:33:18| We can certainly move that to the back of the building, but it's only eight feet from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9198)|
| 2:33:22| the building, which still puts it 37 feet from the property line, which is still 70| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9207)|
| 2:33:27| There are no outdoor runs, and we only walk one or two dogs out at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9207)|
| 2:33:33| And in every clinic I build, there is a sign on the back door that says, you must clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9213)|
| 2:33:38| up after each patient you take outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| Not just because we don't want it to smell out there and be contaminated and be any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9221)|
| 2:33:45| of issue, but we have to do that to protect our patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| Because when they go out, if you have a dog that's sick, you certainly don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| walk the next dog out with contaminated feces out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9232)|
| 2:33:55| But if that is something that Mr. Watson feels would help him or alleviate some of his concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9235)|
| 2:34:00| certainly we would move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9240)|
| 2:34:04| Yeah, it just seems like that would be the entire site for the area for that pen to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9244)|
| 2:34:11| the outside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9251)|
| 2:34:12| It seems like it's the one place that is closest to Mr. Watson's home, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9252)|
| 2:34:17| If he wanted it moved, we certainly would move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9257)|
| 2:34:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9262)|
| 2:34:23| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9266)|
| 2:34:27| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9267)|
| 2:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| When I looked at this, I thought this would be an ideal spot for a veterinary clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9270)|
| 2:34:36| It's a rural area, and it's already zoned agriculture, and this is allowed an agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9276)|
| 2:34:43| zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| And I was really impressed by the fact that they are not proposing any outdoor runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9284)|
| 2:34:53| so that you get a lot of barking dogs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| So, I'm in favor of it, and I would move that we approve staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9296)|
| 2:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| So, Commissioner Graf, you're making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| Commissioner Uten, you were next in line, it looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| Yeah, I'm a little bit with Commissioner Smith on this one and Mr. Graf, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9312)|
| 2:35:18| I think that Emory Road is built for some sort of community services along its corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9318)|
| 2:35:30| I'm a little disappointed with how big this piece of property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9330)|
| 2:35:35| and how far back off the road this particular building and parking and everything is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9335)|
| 2:35:43| I would hope that you would want that up on the road as close as you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| to not intrude back several hundred feet off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9348)|
| 2:35:55| And it looks like there's a sewer line that goes through there and a little bit of drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9355)|
| 2:35:59| and that may be the best hope on the property and why they put the building where they put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9359)|
| 2:36:04| I would have just liked to have seen it closer to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| And then, you know, certainly the Mr. Smith's point with putting the outdoor area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9368)|
| 2:36:16| close to the residential use, you know, there's a 35-foot setback and it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9376)|
| 2:36:23| that eight-foot deep piece is into that setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| So, you know, the whole site plan could be oriented a little bit differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9386)|
| 2:36:31| to be a little more friendly and more oriented towards Emory Road, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9391)|
| 2:36:37| But I'm okay with the use and the intent and the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9397)|
| 2:36:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9402)|
| 2:36:45| Were you making a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| Were you seconding Commissioner Graf's motion or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9407)|
| 2:36:56| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| I don't know. I guess I'd want to hear something with some additional...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9427)|
| 2:37:08| Site plan changes before I would approve this particular site plan the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9428)|
| 2:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| Question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| The 2.2 acres, is it limited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| Could they subdivide the property further and reduce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9446)|
| 2:37:29| Or when we approve this, or if it's approved, does the 2.2 acres stay with the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9449)|
| 2:37:39| I had a look and they can't reduce it less than an acre for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| because that's the minimum lot size in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| I have to look in the ag, see if it also has a larger lot size requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| for non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| I don't know that off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| But, I mean, potentially they could subdivide if they've got enough land area to create a little lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| So, more than likely, since they have to have at least a minimum one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9480)|
| 2:38:05| they're not going to have a whole lot of space to create two lots if it's only just a little over two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9485)|
| 2:38:10| Can we limit it to the 2.2 acres so it can't be subdivided any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9490)|
| 2:38:18| Because I think it looks better, firstly, back off the road a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9498)|
| 2:38:22| It is predominantly a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9502)|
| 2:38:25| I do have a little concern with why it's necessary for a 26-foot-wide driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9505)|
| 2:38:32| Most of the roads in Knox County are not 26 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| So, I'm just looking to try to give it more of a residential flavor rather than a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9515)|
| 2:38:42| Also, I think some additional landscaping in the front of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| and the parking there between the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9527)|
| 2:38:54| So, those are my issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| I'm fine with it sitting back off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| But I understand why it might be better up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| Can I reply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9547)|
| 2:39:07| Can I reply to Commissioner Graf and Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| I'll make it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| As far as the reason the clinic is set where we put it, two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| One, the elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| The ground closer to the road is so low that I think that that would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9563)|
| 2:39:28| We'd have to probably bring in massive amounts of dirt to kind of fill that in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| which may also pose a threat to the surrounding neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| Runoff may be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9577)|
| 2:39:38| The other thing is safety of the pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| I know a lot of you have pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9581)|
| 2:39:42| I saw some pictures behind you sitting there in your offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| You know, if a dog gets loose, it's kind of scary if you're down on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9585)|
| 2:39:52| This gives us a little bit of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| You know, I've never had a dog get loose from one of the clinics I've built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| but it always scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9598)|
| 2:39:59| Or if a client's coming in and they're getting out of the car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| if a dog or cat gets loose, I don't want to be that close to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9602)|
| 2:40:07| So, if you said I had to move it, I would, but I'd prefer not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9607)|
| 2:40:15| That's our reason for the setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9615)|
| 2:40:18| Some of our reasons where we set it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| Did you want to address anything about the driveway width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9622)|
| 2:40:26| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9626)|
| 2:40:27| You tell me what size driveway you'd like, as long as they have room to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9627)|
| 2:40:33| We were going to make a really, really pretty driveway with landscaping and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9633)|
| 2:40:36| but if you feel that it would look nicer for the residents to move a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| I think the architect just drew it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| That's not anything we can fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9650)|
| 2:40:50| We've got another couple of commissioners that have their hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9650)|
| 2:40:54| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9654)|
| 2:40:55| Yes, thanks, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| Mr. Riddles, could you please talk about the uses in agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| just to remind us what could actually go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9665)|
| 2:41:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9670)|
| 2:41:11| Let me pull some of those up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| So, it's quite an extensive list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| I'm not going to go over every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| I'll try to get some highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9680)|
| 2:41:22| So, the permitted uses in the ag zone are houses and duplexes, churches, schools, libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9682)|
| 2:41:29| museums, obviously farming, garage apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| You can actually have a portable sawmill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| Daycare homes and group homes are permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| Then the use is permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| Some of these just don't really work on a lot this size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9706)|
| 2:41:49| but obviously aircraft landing field and hangars and equipment would not work on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9709)|
| 2:41:56| Boat liveries, cemeteries, dog kennels, indoor storage, livery stables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9716)|
| 2:42:04| lodging and boarding homes, rifle ranges, vet clinic, group home, public parks, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9724)|
| 2:42:14| It kind of goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| Some of the uses in this zone just aren't really applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9737)|
| 2:42:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9741)|
| 2:42:22| So, this would really have less impact to the community the way Dr. Rosenzweig has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9742)|
| 2:42:30| I would like to see the design closer to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9750)|
| 2:42:34| I'm in agreement with Commissioner Newton about that and Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9754)|
| 2:42:39| just to keep that one area away from the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| However, if he put up additional landscaping, I think that might help too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9763)|
| 2:42:49| But as far as having the vet clinic in this area, I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9769)|
| 2:42:56| It is a rural area and I think the neighbors would probably enjoy this as time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9776)|
| 2:43:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9786)|
| 2:43:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9787)|
| 2:43:08| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| I support the proposal as it's presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9794)|
| 2:43:17| I think that having the vet clinic set back further because of the topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| and because of pet safety is very logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9801)|
| 2:43:25| I think that's an appropriate location for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| Also, considering the sewer line location and easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| And I think that having the fact that it does not have outdoor kennel runs is excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9810)|
| 2:43:36| Having just the fenced in yard that's small with pets being walked by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9816)|
| 2:43:43| that would be far less disruptive than having a residence with a couple of dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9823)|
| 2:43:48| running right up to the fenced property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| And I think you would have less noise and you're definitely going to have the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| cleaning up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9835)|
| 2:43:55| So, that's a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| I think I'd rather have that facing, I'd rather look at the back of the clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9837)|
| 2:44:04| rather than looking at the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9844)|
| 2:44:05| So, I think its orientation and its location is perfectly appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9845)|
| 2:44:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| Last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9852)|
| 2:44:15| Do we make a distinction between a veterinary hospital and pets staying overnight that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| receiving treatment and boarding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| I mean, is this going to open up to like a kennel where you bring in your dog if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| go on vacation and they keep it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| Or is it just dogs staying there that are being treated or pets being treated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9868)|
| 2:44:35| They can definitely have pets stay overnight that are being treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9875)|
| 2:44:41| They do have a kennel component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| So, it's kind of how they operate their own facility on how they, what kind of animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| they will accept for that kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| It is a small portion of their existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| But a dog kennel, like a true dog kennel, is a use, commit, and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| Also within the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| So, if this was just one giant dog kennel, they could request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9902)|
| 2:45:07| But that's not what they're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| I was asking for, obviously, a vet clinic with a kennel that's in it that is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| typical of vet clinics in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| Okay, so I guess what I'm asking, are we approving a use, commit, and review for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| veterinary clinic or for a dog kennel and a veterinary clinic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9920)|
| 2:45:29| Well, the kenneling is a component of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| I just didn't know if it had to be requested as a separate thing or if it's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9934)|
| 2:45:38| Probably, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| I put it in there in the recommendation for approval, the clarification that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9940)|
| 2:45:45| do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| I'm not sure if it's absolutely necessary in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| I don't know that, unless somebody from a county staff could give an interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9950)|
| 2:45:57| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9957)|
| 2:45:57| But I would think that, you know, kenneling, to some degree, is an accessory used to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9957)|
| 2:46:06| veterinary clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| I guess an applicant might want to address what their intention is for that kenneling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9968)|
| 2:46:13| facility as well, because it may just be for their pets that are staying overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9973)|
| 2:46:19| Okay, let's hear first from the county then with regards to any kind of the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9979)|
| 2:46:27| I think I would be in agreement with Mike Reynolds that the kenneling would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| accessory used to the veterinarian clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9991)|
| 2:46:36| Okay, and let's hear from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| Um, Mr. Resnick, do you have any comments on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=9999)|
| 2:46:48| We're building a veterinary hospital because we want to do veterinary medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| But in general practice for veterinarians, having small kennels are part of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10012)|
| 2:46:58| We do not, it's not like we're going to be doing a large kennel facility, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10018)|
| 2:47:04| there's no outdoor runs, but it's a courtesy and a service for our clients or neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10024)|
| 2:47:10| who may have to go out of town and just need us to house their pets for a couple of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10035)|
| 2:47:16| It is part of our business structure, primary business, but it definitely is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10036)|
| 2:47:23| Okay, Commissioner Buston, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10043)|
| 2:47:28| I do, Madam Chair, I'd like to second the motion that Commissioner Graf made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10048)|
| 2:47:34| Earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10054)|
| 2:47:37| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10057)|
| 2:47:38| Okay, so we have a motion by Commissioner Graf and a second by Commissioner Buston to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10058)|
| 2:47:44| approve the request for a veterinary hospital used on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10064)|
| 2:47:51| Mr. Wise, are you still there or or will Amy be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10071)|
| 2:47:56| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10076)|
| 2:47:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| Yes, we're ready for the roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10083)|
| 2:48:04| Mr. Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10084)|
| 2:48:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10085)|
| 2:48:06| Mr. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10086)|

| 2:48:08| Mr. Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10090)|
| 2:48:10| Mr. Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10092)|
| 2:48:12| Mr. Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10094)|
| 2:48:15| Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10095)|
| 2:48:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| Mr. Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10097)|
| 2:48:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10098)|
| 2:48:18| Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10100)|
| 2:48:20| Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10102)|
| 2:48:22| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10104)|
| 2:48:25| Commissioner Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10105)|
| 2:48:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10106)|
| 2:48:28| It's 12-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10108)|
| 2:48:30| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| 11-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10115)|
| 2:48:36| Motion still carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| That we've reached the end of our agenda, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10119)|
| 2:48:46| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10126)|
| 2:48:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| I want to thank everyone for your patience as we're working through a new way of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10129)|
| 2:48:58| our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10138)|
| 2:48:59| I think this went very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| I hope to see you all in face next month, but in case we are doing this, we've got one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10141)|
| 2:49:10| virtual meeting under our belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| Janice, and good jobs for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| Excellent job for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10158)|
| 2:49:21| And for Janice, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10161)|
| 2:49:24| Janice, let me ask you, do you ever think that it might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10164)|
| 2:49:28| save time if we raised our hands to vote yes, so you don't have to go through roll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10168)|
| 2:49:32| every time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| Do you know that was my suggestion, but I was told that we needed to do roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10173)|
| 2:49:38| And we're still researching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| We want to make sure all the people who are viewing understand that the vote was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10180)|
| 2:49:47| so we'll research that and see if we need to do the roll call or just raising hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10187)|
| 2:49:52| could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| We're learning as we go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| So we'll research that and have an answer before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10196)|
| 2:50:03| I think it's helpful for people that don't have the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10203)|
| 2:50:09| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10209)|
| 2:50:10| Well, if they're not attendees or panelists, yeah, if they're just watching the video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10210)|
| 2:50:15| then they do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| So, yeah, I agree, Commissioner Smith, that it does seem a little redundant, but it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10217)|
| 2:50:24| allow everybody to know how everybody voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10224)|
| 2:50:29| So, with that, any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10229)|
| 2:50:34| I'm worried about Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| He's been sitting in the sun for the last three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| He's got sunscreen on my forehead, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10238)|
| 2:50:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10244)|
| 2:50:45| I have my hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| Oh, yes, Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10246)|
| 2:50:49| Great meeting, motion to adjourn, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| And we have Mike Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10252)|
| 2:50:55| Before we hear that motion, we have Mike Crowder with his hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10255)|
| 2:51:00| Gail took the words right out of my mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| I was going to make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10262)|
| 2:51:03| Well, I guess you can second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10263)|
| 2:51:06| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10266)|
| 2:51:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10267)|
| 2:51:07| I also wanted to ask Gerald, how did Linus feel about the last vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10267)|
| 2:51:12| Well, he was happy to have a vet clinic in his neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10272)|
| 2:51:16| He's very happy to have one closer by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10276)|
| 2:51:18| Although he's a fan of the Central Vet Clinic on Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10278)|
| 2:51:24| It's hard to pry him loose from his favorite doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| especially when he likes to try to nip to his favorite doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10287)|
| 2:51:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10293)|
| 2:51:34| Great meeting, Linus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| You did well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10298)|
| 2:51:39| Y'all did well as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| Talk to y'all soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10301)|
| 2:51:42| Bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200409?start=10302)|
