| 0:00:31| Welcome to the Board of Education's June 8, 2022 Regular Session Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=31)|
| 0:00:36| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=36)|
| 0:01:01| I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=70)|
| 0:01:17| Mr. Watson will not be joining us tonight as he is still traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=77)|
| 0:01:31| Are there any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=91)|
| 0:01:39| So a motion to approve by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Satterfield. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=99)|

| 0:01:51| And I believe we have a couple of special recognitions tonight. Dr. Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=111)|
| 0:01:57| Thank you, Madam Chair and Board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| I'm very excited to recognize two schools that recently achieved an important designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| Last month, Green Magnet Academy and South Oil High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| were honored by the Tennessee Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| with a STEM designation related to science, technology, engineering and math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| This designation recognizes schools who have committed to integrating quality STEM teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| and learning practices for all their students within their school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| And it represents a continuum of these intense application process for both schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| Only 27 schools across the state received the designation this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| So we're proud that Green Magnet and South Oil High School were included in that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| I want to publicly acknowledge Green Magnet principal, Ms. Jessica Holman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| and her team, along with South Oil principal, Tim Berry, and his team for all their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| Please join me in congratulating Green Magnet Academy and South Oil High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| So if we can have our friends from Green to come up first, we'll do a photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=169)|

| 0:06:13| which is the first elementary school to receive the STEM designation in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=373)|

| 0:21:30| Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| I just want to reiterate the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| opportunity for any board members that want to give input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| So I'm having Terry coordinate an opportunity for the search committee to get together to look at the evaluations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| the previous evaluation, the current evaluations that our search firm has sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| And she also sent a current evaluation that a neighboring county is using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| And then also any additional resources that you all might have that we want to look at to make sure that we have the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| evaluation tool that we can use given this new opportunity with the new superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| So if you all want to get that to Terry so that Terry can plan our meeting, our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| I ideally would want it to happen by the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| I know that my schedule is crazy, but we'll make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| And then we'll have it on the bring it to the board in July's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| And then hopefully we can vote and approve on that evaluation come August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| That's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| I don't think we've seen this yet, but could you send to the board, Ms. Coatney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| what TSBA has sent so that we can just review that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Because I think that would be helpful in giving you feedback to pass on to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| And as part of that, is it going to be the time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Because I know last year when we went through all this, we had decided we were actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| just because of data and stuff, we wanted that doing the review in June or whatever was not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| And we had talked about moving it to fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| So will that be part of the discussion as to actually when the review should take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| And so if you have memory of that discussion, please send that to Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| Terry probably has the notes, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| Yeah, actually that would probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Yeah, I'm letting you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Whatever you want to see in this evaluation, we're starting completely from the scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| So if we had previous discussions, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Well, I mean, my thought would be I think one of the problems so many of us had was not really what the evaluation was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| but with the timing of it, we actually could not get the data that we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| So I do think it's very important for us to talk to the data people within KCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220608?start=1413)|
