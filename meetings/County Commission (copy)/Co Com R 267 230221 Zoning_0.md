| 0:03:05| No. Yes. Seeing none, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| Good evening. The Planning Commission recommendation to County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=192)|

| 0:03:22| Thank you. Mr. Cannon, would you like to speak to your project? This is my first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=202)|
| 0:03:33| time. I don't I didn't have anything prepared. I'll answer any questions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| concerns but. Okay. Commissioners, do you have any questions or concerns with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| zoning item? Commissioner Lee? Yes. I have I had a few questions. I had some notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=225)|
| 0:03:58| that this was denied by staff. It was recommended to be denied by staff. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| and because it was not consistent? It was not consistent with the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| and so this is my first time and I've thoroughly enjoyed it learning in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| headaches but so I thought it was going to be fine and then when they posted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| recommended to be denied we said how come they said the growth plan and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| probably farmland that was so old that Pettigo ran through it and so it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| that little 7 tenth of an acre is on the left side of the road and the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| parcel the other 15 acres on the other side of the road were in the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| it was just this little chunk the one that we actually want to build on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| was missing and so it's not appropriate for agricultural because it's so teeny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| and I can't build on it because it's less than an acre which I learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| because you got to have an acre for ag and so it had kind of made it useless or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| unusable the way it was set up. So what are you going to do with it then? Build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=302)|
| 0:05:10| single-family home on it. One single? Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| Commissioner Frazier? Thank you Madam Chair that was my question just what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| the intention of the property and you you mentioned a single-family home and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| then Director Brooks because staff recommended denial and I just had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| question the recommendation was for RA was PR considered? I think we had we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=332)|
| 0:05:41| looked at PR because it matched the neighborhood right there but and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| correct me if I'm wrong I think I was asking for RA because it seemed like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| less of an ask where where PR could theoretically support more houses with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| less of a setback and so I could have tried to squeeze two houses on here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| I just want to put one and cut my teeth not go bankrupt on the first one yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| Is there any more discussion? Commissioner Schoonmaker? Yes. Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| question? Because of the unusual shape of this 0.7 acres of land if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=379)|
| 0:06:33| decided to move forward with approval for one home can we make then or should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=393)|
| 0:06:44| we consider possibly that if he's going to do a home there he cannot come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| to the BZA and ask for any variances because he's now created his own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| hardship trying to build on this unusual piece of property. Because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=413)|
| 0:07:02| something came up in work session about this property and and not allowing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| the purchaser of the property to get any variances on this on this land so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| could I'm assuming make the motion then to approve but with no variances. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| defer to Director Moyers on the legality of that. Respectfully Commissioner I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| don't think that would be an appropriate motion. The Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Appeals exists as a as an independent quasi-judicial body for a reason so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| don't think you have the authority to tie their hands in that in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| Even though that the staff has voted to deny this request? The staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=462)|
| 0:07:50| doesn't really vote. The staff makes a recommendation. The Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| is the one that's empowered to make the recommendation to this Commission. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| Commission is the only body that's actually empowered to change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| But you can change it or you cannot change it but I don't think that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| condition the change on withdrawing jurisdiction from the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| Appeals to consider any variances that it it might that might be brought to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| The board can certainly consider if the lot is substandard or too small to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| on that that doesn't constitute a hardship from a variance point of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| but we don't know. He might start putting down footers and find that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| there's a spring on the property and suddenly have a topographical hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| that he has to build around. So I again respectfully don't think that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| would be an appropriate motion for this body to support. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| I think to further clarify what Commissioner Skoonmaker is worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| is that the developer, the owner, we want you to be aware you can't create your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| own hardships for those to be considered at BZA. Just be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| Is there any more discussion regarding this zoning item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| Seeing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| Seeing none, I will defer to the District 7 Commissioner. Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| Yes, I'd make a motion to approve the rezoning from agriculture to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| Motion to approve per Planning Commission's recommendations by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=578)|
| 0:09:47| Commissioner Lee with a second by Commissioner Beeler. Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| Just remember we'll watch this and we'll show up at BZA if we see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| Seeing none, all those in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=600)|

| 0:12:22| I have some concerns about this just because of the five per acre that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| your ask. I'm noticing that the property surrounding it is either acre or half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| acre lots and even when you step out past that the areas are either three per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=757)|
| 0:12:46| acre or four per acre. How many homes are you actually thinking you'll be putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| on that property? So according to the Knox County Commission and I've been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| touch with Mike and we've been working on this project, we are not allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| put any more than 35 units on this land and there's currently a subdivision right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| across the road and they have the same exact zoning, the same exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| and I think it's five dwellings per acre as well, if not more. So 35 is caps as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=797)|
| 0:13:26| are allowed from Knox County Planning. That's what we're allowed to put on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| there. We are not allowed to put anything more than that. Now depending on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| layout, depending on all the other stuff that could be reduced once the engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| they start designing and you know working on this project. Actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| directly across the street from you, you have it looks like a parcel of several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| acres and then the one immediately if you're facing the property to the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| the strip is approved at less than three per acre. Commissioner Hill, can you speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| into the mic please? I'm sorry, did you hear me? Not quite, no. Oh I'm sorry, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| parcel that's a directly across the street on Shod Road, it still looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| it's one home that has, I don't know, five, six, several acres. Well I'm talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=854)|
| 0:14:22| about the lot right over, it's one to four dwellings per acre and then the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| behind it, it's five, you know, five dwellings per acre but a house over. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| it's, you know, it's more than enough land to simply do and put up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=875)|
| 0:14:45| 35 units and according to the staff there wasn't any problems to do it. Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| the staff isn't the final say. And that's what I'm hearing tonight. Right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| and my concern is even when you get out beyond that it's it's less than five per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| acre. None of them are zoned right at five and I do notice there's two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| streams running through. Yes. Through that. I have no idea how wide they are, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| much, what are your plans? I mean there's those two in the back, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| you going to cross over one with a bridge or something? Well as of right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| now ma'am I cannot, you know, assure you what exactly is going to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| because I am in the process to work with an engineer on this project and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| depending again, depending on the layout and because of the, because of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| creeks and stuff, that number of units would be reduced most likely. 35 is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| cap, what we're allowed to, what, you know, we asked for is maximum that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| put in there. Will we put 35? I'm not sure. I think, you know, we have to start on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| this project and that's, like I said, that's one of the reasons why we're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| too. This is the beginning of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| It might be 25 units, it might be 30 units, I'm not really sure until we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| the designing. Yes, and I understand that and I understand too that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| have to produce a site plan at this stage. I mean I do understand your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| dilemma in this too. Yeah, and I don't know the size of the creeks, I mean they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| would have to, you know, the engineer would have to work on it and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| surveyors involved and measure all that stuff, so I don't know exactly the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| of those creeks that are there right now. See, my concern is that looking at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| creeks in the back, I mean it's conceivable you cannot build in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| back section at all, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1008)|
| 0:16:57| because we don't really know how much buildable, usable land you have in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| that approving at five per acre could conceivably end up with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| squeezing six or seven per acre on the total amount of property. Do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1028)|
| 0:17:16| understand what I'm saying? I understand exactly what you're saying. I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| have about seven acres of buildable land, you know, considering all the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| and all that stuff, and again I am not really sure until we start working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| the project and kind of get the layout and see what we're able to do, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| plan is to put duplexes on these, or condos on them, not homes. Condos? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| All right, attached units? Yes. How many? Up to four in a row. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| Up to four condos. All right, well that definitely makes the difference. Yes. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| know, as opposed to full homes. Yeah, they're not going to be homes, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| going to be condominiums, pretty much four units in a row, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| you'll have another building and a few other buildings. So when you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| condominium, do you mean a truly maintenance-free community? Something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1088)|
| 0:18:16| like that, yes. Something like that? I mean, I'm not exactly sure what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| trying to ask me, ma'am. Well, typically when you think of a condominium, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| have an HOA that takes care of all of the... Yes, I understand that they have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| HOA, but that's, of course, the finishing project, and if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| decide to sell it later on, then we can arrange all this stuff. But as of right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| now, we're just trying to build them and ask your permission for it. All right. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| know that it was probably so easily approved because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| improvements there in Shod Road, and that everything Mr. Snowden's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| going to be dumping out on this new Shod Road that's going to be newer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| improved and greater, and I do understand you said that there will not be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| turn lane, and excuse me, I'm directing this to Mr. Snowden now, there will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| be a turn lane there or even a barrier where the street can be crossed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| in front of that section of property. Is that correct? Correct. Yeah, I was looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| at the plans just now. There'll be a right-in, right-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| configuration here. There, as you pull up to the train's development to exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| there'll be a median that'll be immediately in front of you, so you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| have to go right to the next median opening, and there's really not a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| flexibility we have to relocate those median or adjust the opening, so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| would be a right-in, right-out configuration. All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| Is there any other discussion? All right, thank you. Mr. J? Thank you, Madam Chair. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1193)|
| 0:20:04| this is sort of a question for Commissioner Hill, but also just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| general question. On this commission, we have said time and again, based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| data, based on reports, that we need more housing. We need all types of housing. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| need all types of configurations of housing, and we've constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| said that we want to encourage that to be on major arteries and growth areas in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| major corridors. This is about as a major corridor as you can get. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| Chadrode Extension with two lanes on each side, a median. This is a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| type of house that we need the inventory for. I'm confused at why we wouldn't, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| is exactly why we would put density in a corridor that can handle density versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| something similar far out away from infrastructure, so I would just sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| remind our commissioners, like, this is exactly what we're asking for. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| asking for different types of housing, clustered and concentrated in dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| areas, and it looks like a perfect example of what we've been constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| asking people to do is find innovation that brings people to more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| major corridors, so I think it's a good project, and I think it's exactly in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| right spot, and Chadrode is going to have 50 more of these because that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| we're building this major artery right through our community, so I'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| supporting it. Mr. Schumacher, you good? Anyone else? I'm prepared to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1290)|
| 0:21:42| motion that we approve this at not, at, how do I word that when it's less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1302)|
| 0:21:51| five on the surrounding properties? We can't hear you, I'm sorry. How do I word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| that when it's less than five? Four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| I'm prepared to recommend this at four per acre as it is truly consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| all of the other zoning that has occurred around that property. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1329)|
| 0:22:18| Motion is to approve, excuse me, motion to approve PR zone up to four dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1338)|
| 0:22:29| units per acre, correct? By Commissioner Hill with a second by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| Frazier. Commissioner Jay. Madam Chair, thank you. I'd like to offer a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1356)|
| 0:22:45| substitute motion to approve at five units an acre. There's a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| literally right below this at five units an acre. I think it's on a major artery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| and it's exactly what we've been asking for, for the type of inventory, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| think it's more than appropriate. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| It's five in this. Up to, that's five. The one right below that says up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| units per acre, right below to the left. And then there's another one at less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| than five units, or up to five units an acre. It's five or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1394)|

| 0:23:28| major growth corridor. I don't understand why we wouldn't approve more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| growth in our growth corridor. That's why I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| Can I just add something real quick, please? Yes. So before, you know, when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| started working on this project, I've had several meetings with the staff and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| were going back and forth before even submitting, you know, all the plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| all these rezoning stuff. So after talking with engineering and went on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| the engineering department and getting involved with them and asking them about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| the road and all that stuff, that's where we came with this conclusion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| that's where the staff kind of pointed us in the right, you know, in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| direction to ask five, you know, at least up to five units per acre. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| wasn't something easy because we've been going back and forth for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| last couple of months and have quite a few actually for about four months. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| I'm just asking to go ahead and approve this if it's possible. And like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| it's up to five units. It doesn't mean that we're going to have 35 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| depending on the design, depending on the layout and depending on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| with all those creeks and stuff, it could well be less than that. It could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| even be four. It's just at this point, I am not exactly sure until we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| designing the project and then coming up with a plan and coming up with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| design and then provide, you know, providing it to the staff so they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| review it. But I would kindly ask you to approve their, approve the five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1497)|
| 0:25:06| acres per dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Thank you, Madam Chair. And just to clarify, Commissioner Hill, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| what you were trying to achieve with your motion is that staff recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| 31.4 units as the total number of units that is appropriate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1519)|
| 0:25:27| this piece of property, given the topography and the blue line streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| I also just want to point out, too, that a general plan encourages a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| pedestrian-oriented neighborhood. And then the sector plan offers this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| as a great place for a mixed-use special district conservation subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| So that's probably where Commissioner Hill is coming from. The sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| is offering or encouraging larger lots in a conservation subdivision, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| would also be appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Can I ask you, Mr. Gervon, kind of what price range that you guys are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| at on these condos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| So the condos, as of right now, it's a project that we're thinking to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| and maybe rent them out instead of selling. That's the plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Okay. What would your rental be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| So depending on the price, everything fluctuates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Right, right. I'm not old news at that price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Depending on the price that each condominium comes out to be, anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| between $1,500 to maybe $2,000, depending on that price range, we can rent them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| Okay. Which that's completely appropriate over in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Yes, ma'am. Especially for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Yeah. I mean, I personally would like to see you sell it because, as a realtor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| we need more housing on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| And if the price is right, we would love to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| I'm going to put my mic...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Seeing none, Commissioner Hill, I mean, pardon me, there's a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1619)|

| 0:27:14| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1634)|

| 0:29:51| I would. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| We would like to request this evening that County Commission actually approve for 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1793)|
| 0:30:02| acres, 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| The reason that we're requesting that is since we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Since we went before the Planning Commission, we actually have gone back to our civil engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| Scott Williams, and asked him to design us a road that would tie into one of our properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| that is adjacent that actually is on an arterial highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| And so, we are going to use that road primarily for our residents to funnel them back out to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1835)|
| 0:30:45| And that should reduce down the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| We actually have met with the neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| They had a lot of concerns about the traffic on Clayberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| I think Planning Commission had the same concerns, just that we weren't tied into an arterial highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| and that we would be coming out through Clayberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| So, what we're proposing to do is bring a road back on to Willow Place Apartments and have our traffic go through there primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1867)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Fellow commissioners, any questions or discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1894)|
| 0:31:34| What are your concerns about the road access the way he's describing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| We shared in some of the concerns with the density using Clayberry Drive because it is residential street, dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| So, from the transportation perspective, we would much prefer them to access the arterial street where there's adequate turn lanes along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1908)|
| 0:32:00| So, they would access through Willow Bend Way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Is that the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| I didn't quite follow what you were...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I have a couple of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| I don't have the big drawing with me here tonight, but I can give you kind of a look of where our apartments are and where the road would tie on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1932)|
| 0:32:21| Did you guys pull up the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| So, if you look, the yellow highlighted ag that has the two buildings on it is the property we're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1945)|
| 0:32:34| Willow Bend is right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| We've actually built out 20 senior apartments there, but we want to come down the right side that would run by, if you know the area, it's the CARM building there or the CARM rental store, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1956)|
| 0:32:53| Or used goods store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| So, we'd want to come down and tie into our own property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1977)|
| 0:33:16| Just for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| You need to get back at the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Just for clarification as he's returning, the apartments they're tying into are existing low-income senior housing, one-bedroom, single-level homes, and the tie-in will be for the same type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2002)|
| 0:33:41| So, it's just a continuation of an existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Would you, if I'm clear, would you then be terminating any entrance and exit into Claybury?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2033)|
| 0:34:01| No, we wouldn't terminate that, and I don't think that the residents had any issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| They just wanted us to direct our traffic back onto our property and for our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| The people that were going to house our tenants to go out towards Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| So, it wouldn't prevent somebody from still going back through the other end of the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2063)|
| 0:34:23| It wouldn't, although we wouldn't open up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| The road would have a buffer there, just a slight buffer or medium between the CARM store, that open retail space there, and ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2066)|
| 0:34:36| So, it wouldn't be directly open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| It would open only onto our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| It would tie back into our existing paving and driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| So, am I clear in that, although the planning department voted to move it forward at how many units here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2085)|
| 0:34:58| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2099)|
| 0:34:59| You're asking this body to consider 12, which was your original application, because the other apartments that you currently exist at, this would all be an extension of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2099)|
| 0:35:10| I see one is zoned for 12, one is up to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| So, you're asking to be consistent with those and go above what was already voted through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2120)|
| 0:35:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2121)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Director Snowden, Director Brooks, can you speak to the access remaining on Clayberry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| Was that the assumption with the alternative access being presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| And also to you, I wanted to thank you for reaching out to the community and having that dialogue with them and giving them an opportunity to express any concerns and for you to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2138)|
| 0:35:49| We really appreciate when applicants do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| So, thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| I'll let Amy speak too, but Commissioner Frazier, to your point, first, I've heard of this connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| I mean, I think it's a good idea in the sense of it's going to bring traffic to that arterial street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| But I would prefer the connection to Clayberry be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2168)|
| 0:36:16| It's, you've essentially got a public street that's going to go through his development that's going to act like a public street because you're attaching two public streets together with a public, with a private street in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2176)|
| 0:36:27| And that's, that's problematic for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| Director Brooks, do you concur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| I concur with what Director Snowden just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| I have concerns about keeping the access open on Clayberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| I couldn't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| You concur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Mr. Moyers, can you, would that be considered a conditional zoning if we were to support his request, but with the condition that Clayberry would be terminated and he would have to funnel through his existing property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2213)|
| 0:37:07| Is that, is that allowed or would that be a conditional zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| It would not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| It is a conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Conditional zoning is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| It's contract zoning that's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Contract zoning, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| It would be conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| You do have the power to do conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| That would be a conditional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| That's, I will always defer to our first steps with the district commissioner, but I would also, I would, I'd be open to approving his request at a higher rate than it was sent to us, but with the termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2242)|
| 0:37:38| Because I, this is similar to North, I want to say it's like Northampton Commons, or it was another one that we dealt with before where they were kind of like shoehorning a neighborhood in behind another neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2258)|
| 0:37:50| And I think that out of respect for the existing neighborhood did not have that cross traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| I would be willing to support the higher one, but we'll see what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| If, if I'm, I'm not mistaken, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| Harris, and they, they did in fact have a, a neighborhood meeting, speaks to the fact that no one's here objecting to it on, on Claybury, the excellent job that was done with some give and take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2290)|
| 0:38:26| I think that the, part of the reason that they had talked about still leaving some access, although I don't think it's a deal breaker, was just for perhaps more of a convenience of the few employees that might be working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2306)|
| 0:38:49| And the truth of the matter is this being a senior facility, there, there are many, many less cars than there typically would be in a group of one bedroom apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2329)|
| 0:39:03| So the residents of Claybury were actually comfortable with not having that totally closed off because of that very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2343)|
| 0:39:14| This is not going to be a major thoroughfare anyway, even once it is completed because of the age of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2354)|
| 0:39:25| Is that, is that correct, Mr. Harris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| And the other thing that we had thought about with Claybury being open was easier for like E1, E911 services to be able to, to move through the neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2368)|
| 0:39:40| And so to be able to get to our seniors, because we do have, you know, calls and then also the fire trucks and you have to have a turning area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2380)|
| 0:39:48| So it kind of creates additional road work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Like you said, it's not a deal breaker for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| And it's just not something that came up within the, within the community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| So, again, I don't know that we have any opposition to closing off Claybury, but we did, we were mostly thinking for emergency services to be able to come through it a little bit easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2400)|
| 0:40:14| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| I still defer to our director of engineering and public works with that being problematic, tying in private and public roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2416)|
| 0:40:30| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| I appreciate, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| And I appreciate that the folks in Claybury, but as Commissioner Jay said, we've set a precedent already by not allowing access through a residential subdivision on another project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2432)|
| 0:40:45| And so you need to remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| I just want to thank you for having a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| And I think that's always good to, for you guys to come and talk to the community and find out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| It does speak volumes, not having anybody here to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Also want to say, we talk about all different kinds of housing and we're worried about all kinds of different housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| And sometimes I think our seniors on very fixed incomes kind of get forgotten in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| So I really appreciate that we are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| And I know the area, I know that you guys have done a really good job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| And with the economy, the way it is, I think you guys are going to probably fill them up really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| So I appreciate you looking out for that sector of the community that really needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| We have a, we have a two year waiting list on our senior housing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| So I'm not, not worried about filling it up, but we also are entertaining and wanting to get to that 12 unit per acre number because there is such a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2494)|
| 0:41:45| We were going to use Clayberry before it basically at 40 units or eight units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| So again, not, not necessarily opposed to it being closed off, but I guess it just kind of terminates and kind of walls us in, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2512)|
| 0:42:02| So, yeah, and I agree with Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| I'm always probably going to defer to Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| Sure. And in fairness to him, he is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| We did not talk about the additional road before, before tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| It was brainstorming and then we went out and talked to the neighborhood, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| Any more discussion? Seeing none, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| I am prepared to offer a motion to approve this at 12 per acre with the condition that when it's all said and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2549)|
| 0:42:40| Clayberry does end up being a, a closed road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2565)|
| 0:42:54| Motion is to approve up to 12 dwelling units per acre with the closing of Clayberry Drive, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2574)|
| 0:43:09| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Is it the closing of the drive or are they just closing off this, this development to the drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| Access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| That's, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Closing off access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Thank you. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| By Commissioner Hill with a second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Seeing none, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2615)|

| 0:44:56| Wish to speak to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| It's just a very simple project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| We're building three residential homes for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| That's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| We're just trying to split it up into three different lots and just to build three residential homes and sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| Commissioners, any questions or discussion regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| Commissioner Wheeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| I have a question for Mr. Chabon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| What would the access be to these three houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| Right now, we're actually in the process with the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| We gave them a copy of the design plan and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| We're going to enter from Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| And the discussion is right now, I guess the engineer, they're wanting us to use one driveway and just kind of share the driveway between three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2748)|
| 0:45:57| And we're just going back and forth to see if we can have another driveway for the front house that's closer to Washington Pike to have its own access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2757)|
| 0:46:06| And then the two will be sharing one driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| But the access will be from Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| There wouldn't be any access from the property behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| There's no access, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Is there going to be room for additional driveways there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| Is there a driveway there at that other property where it comes down beside it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| I believe there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| We were looking at this one today, just saw the plan literally today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| And I think the plan shows one driveway accessing two units towards the back at the existing location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| And then the lot that I guess would be closer to the creek or closer to Washington Pike and the creek would have a second driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2809)|
| 0:46:59| I haven't given that a lot of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| But my first blush on it would be to consolidate those driveways and have one driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| There is an existing driveway on the property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| It's just hard to see it with the overlays the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| I'll defer if anybody else has questions or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| Director Brooks, the Northwest County Sector Plan allows PR at one dwelling per acre clustered in rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| So why does he need a Sector Plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| And to the body, again, we've set a precedent in the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| A very similar case, we upheld the Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| So just remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Can you tell me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| Can you repeat your question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Just the Northwest County Sector Plan allows PR at one dwelling per acre clustered in the rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2873)|
| 0:48:02| And the Growth Policy Plan allows two dwellings in rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| So why are we not upholding the Sector Plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| Why do they need a Sector Plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| Well, the Growth Policy Plan, I think typically the way – the Growth Policy Plan is the one that controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| So everything needs to adhere to the Growth Policy Plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| I think that there's been some inconsistencies in how those densities have been applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2903)|
| 0:48:31| And when you look at the different Sector Plans, I'll just admit that based on when they were updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| you might see some differences in terms of the dwelling units per acre permitted based in that land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| It does, and that's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Because in the past, staff has recommended that we follow the Sector Plan or the most current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2928)|
| 0:48:56| In this case, the Sector Plan is more current than the Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| And so I guess I'm confused as to the inconsistencies and why now are we referring to the General Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2940)|
| 0:49:09| And again, because precedent has been set, we followed the Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| I just – I need some clarification because from a body standpoint, nothing has been communicated to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| Maybe I've missed something as to what we should refer to as what is taking precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2963)|
| 0:49:33| I think over the last five to six years, staff have tried to really make a concerted effort to make sure that all recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| they're not in conflict in particular with the Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| Because I think in the past that has been historically, there's been a disconnect there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| So there has been a concerted effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Maybe when they thought that it wasn't active or – anyway, I won't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2989)|
| 0:49:57| I think this body remembers for a while the Growth Policy Plan was seen as not current and then it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=2997)|
| 0:50:06| And then the map didn't apply and then it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| And so now we're back to that it does apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3009)|
| 0:50:16| And that's – please don't think that I'm directing that at planning staff or anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| It is just frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| I'm still going to encourage the body to uphold the Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Kind of following up on Commissioner Fraser's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| who has made the directive that we're now to follow the Growth Plan only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| and not to the most recent plan that's been adopted by not only Knox Planning but the Knox County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3048)|
| 0:50:57| Somebody's had to make a directive to you all to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| So I'd just kind of like to know, like Commissioner Fraser, what's going on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3061)|
| 0:51:10| I don't know that I can answer that to your satisfaction, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| I don't think that – one, I would probably – I've been out and then I've come back in to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3074)|
| 0:51:24| I think we're typically here to share the Planning Commission's recommendation to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| And that is one of the reasons I'll put in a – how important that the Advanced Knox process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3091)|
| 0:51:40| and to really take a deep look at how we do planning in this community and to clean up all these different layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3100)|
| 0:51:49| So I think that that's going forward where we'll start to address some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3109)|
| 0:51:59| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Then I will defer to the Commission District 8 Commissioner, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Could we scroll that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| The image that's on the screen, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Yeah, can we scroll that up to the – like the next map, keep going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| Yeah, that one, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| So, I mean, as Commissioner Schoonmaker, Commissioner Frazier pointed out, I think Mr. Murphy's going to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3149)|
| 0:52:37| the issue is over really the next item and the density as to whether or not this body should be allowing two units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3157)|
| 0:52:46| rather than one in this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| The sector plan amendment, for obvious reasons, I really don't have an issue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| because this property is literally surrounded by rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| So, I mean, I don't have an issue with the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| I think it is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| So, however, I do look forward to hearing from Mr. Murphy and discussing the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| So, my motion on this item is to approve the Northeast County Sector Plan Amendment from AG Agricultural to RR Rural Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| as recommended by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| Motion to approve per Planning Commission's recommendation by Commissioner Buehler with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3203)|
| 0:53:33| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Seeing none, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3224)|

| 0:54:01| It's for a rezoning from A Agricultural to PR Plan Residential up to two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| and the property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Mr. Murphy, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| It's Igor Choban, 6939 Glen Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Mr. Murphy, you've signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| Is there anyone else who is in opposition or wishes to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| So, Mr. Choban, I will give you time to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| and then I will give Mr. Murphy the equal amount of time of five minutes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| I mean, there's really nothing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| We're just trying to build two residential homes for sale on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| We're splitting them up into two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Simple, you know, straightforward, nothing crazy, and we're just trying to sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| And as Mr. Murphy is getting ready, Ms. Brooks, will you read us Planning Commission's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the PR plan residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| up to two dwellings per acre because it's consistent with the surrounding area by a vote of 12 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Mr. Murphy, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| So, this case is kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| There's been a little parade of requests in the northeast sector the last few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| for rezonings to the planned residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| Northeast sector is one of a couple of sectors where when the sector plan was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| the land use classification table talks about densities allowed in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3352)|
| 0:55:59| and it talks about densities associated with the agricultural land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| as well as the rural residential land use plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| In both that, agricultural and rural residential, in the northeast county sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| it says that in the rural area, the recommended zoning is one unit per acre clustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3373)|
| 0:56:20| That's for both agriculture and rural residential in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| So, that's what the sector plan says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| And that document, the northeast sector plan, this was specifically discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| and that piece of the land use classification table is something that people looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| when the plan was updated in the 2016 timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| I remember looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| I went to most of those meetings and I remember very much paying attention to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| as something that was really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| And to see that limit in there was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| So, two months ago on Millertown Pike, the staff recommendation said to be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3413)|
| 0:57:01| with all of the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| It recommended one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| Now, this time, this one came through and at the agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| there was a new interpretation that was presented where the staff said they looked at things again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| and they decided that the growth policy plan should be the controlling document here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| in terms of the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| So, let's walk through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| That was new information and I believe at the agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| Director Welch said that the county commission would get a memo on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| Let's talk through that because this is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| First, there is absolutely language both in state statute and the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| It says that things need to be consistent with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| State statute, there are specific instructions that land use decisions need to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| In our zoning ordinance, we've also got language in 6.30 that says amendments must be consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3477)|
| 0:58:05| and not in conflict and it lists out the growth plan, the general plan, the sector plan, land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| So, we've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Things need to be consistent with and not in conflict with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| I think I've talked about the funnel analogy before where at the top layer, the broadest layer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3497)|
| 0:58:25| you have the growth plan and that sets out your macro, your large concepts and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| and it sets out some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Then at your next layer, you narrow the funnel down and you get to our general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| which gets a little bit more specific on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| Finally, you get down to sector plans, which are usually the most specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| but we even have small area plans as well and corridor studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| So, we have a number of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| I kind of think of it as a funnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| The growth plan, what's really important is it talks about rezoning in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| shall be limited to the following districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| It lists out ag, the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| It says planned residential densities up to two dwelling units per acre based off things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| Then it goes on to say extensions of low density residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| densities of one to three dwelling units per acre in the rural area shall be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| to the following conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| So, it says that if you want to extend that zoning up to three units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| there are some conditions that you have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| All right, so we have some conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| If you want three, you've got some conditions you need to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| In our sector plan land use table, it goes on and it says, well, we've actually looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| and we've said that even if you meet those conditions, we still, for this sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| the northeast county sector, we want it to be one unit per acre as the top limit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| Now, that, you get into legal language of is that consistent with and not in conflict with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| We argue that it is consistent with and not in conflict with the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| or the growth plan and the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| By the way, there are things that are not in the growth plan for density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| like the urban area and the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| Those don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| Those densities aren't in the growth plan, but there are some limits imposed in the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| like five units per acre in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| So, we've used this analogy before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| Finally, I think I would argue that if we're going to change the way that we're interpreting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| well, this was something that was done through the public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| and if there wants to be a change, let's, you know, that can be proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| and you can do a text change to the sector plan in that land use classification table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| and take that back through the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| But an administrative change seems a little bit over the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| Mr. Chairman, you can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| Well, I truthfully don't have anything to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| It was just so much too much to process, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| I mean, I'm just looking at the maps and I'm looking at KGIS right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| I mean, everything surrounding it is R1 or, you know, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| So, you know, again, going back with staff, talking with them, discussing with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| They thought it was the best, you know, best way to go and best task to get her approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| and I just really, really, you know, want you guys to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| and hopefully we can get her approved and build these two homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| and sell them to those people that are in need of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Commissioners, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Just a clarifying point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Initially I thought you said three homes, and then again you said two homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| No, Washington Pike was three homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| This Cavalier is two homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| We're still in Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| Just on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Just the three, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| So on 1.74 acres, you want three homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| And is the home there going to be torn down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| And that shared driveway that goes to the house in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| that's what engineering is saying all the traffic has to go through that shared driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| And we're going to have a turnaround at the end just as Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| they've responded to our proposed plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| and we're going to follow up with them and do exactly what they're asking us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| It's going to be one shared driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| And Mr. Murphy then on the rural residential, they can do two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| Seeing none, I'll defer to Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| Just a question, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| So the neighborhood, you know, directly to the southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| which is three, I believe, units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| I guess I'll ask either Ms. Brooks or Mr. Murphy or somebody this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| Did you say that that was approved out of compliance with the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3791)|
| 1:03:20| Kevin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| I believe, Commissioner Beeler, I looked at that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| That one was rezoned back in somewhere between 95 and 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| so it was a number of years before the 2016 sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| These three in a row, as Mr. Murphy pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| three in a row in the 8th District we've had requests for a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| and PR at two units per acre in a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3832)|
| 1:04:00| This is the tiniest piece of property of all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| and it is in an area where there's more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3844)|
| 1:04:14| Mr. Snowden, how do you feel about three houses on this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| Is it feasible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| I mean, I look at it and I can see two, but three scares me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3863)|
| 1:04:32| I mean, I'll just be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| This being as small a piece of property as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| you've got a neighborhood here that's three per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| but there's no way on this size property you're going to be able to get the kind of infrastructure you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| in a three-unit per acre subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| But at the same time, I don't necessarily think it has to be limited to one house either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3894)|
| 1:05:06| Nobody's probably going to like this, but I'd be prepared to make a motion for 1.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| which would allow them to put two houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| So I'll go ahead and make that motion, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| to approve this rezoning at a density of 1.2 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3917)|
| 1:05:26| Motion is to approve the PR zone of up to 1.2 dwelling units per acre by Commissioner Baylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3926)|
| 1:05:35| with a second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| I'd love to hear the answer from Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| Yeah, I was talking to Mr. Bain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| My concern is, and obviously I'm put on the spot here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| I don't really have the topography map or anything like that to really give a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| but Mr. Bain said that there was sewer available there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| so that's one of the bigger constraints for density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| So just from really high level, 30,000 foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| I don't necessarily see why you couldn't engineer to have three there if you so wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3968)|
| 1:06:18| Commissioner Baylor, 1.2 would give you how many units, just two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| Two on 1.74 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3982)|
| 1:06:37| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| Can I just add something real quick here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| I'm looking, I have the layout, the surveyor layout for the three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| I mean, lot one, closer to Washington Pike, is 0.51 of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| Lot two is 0.49, and lot three is 0.75 almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| So I mean, almost all of them are at least half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| I mean, to put a house, some of these lots, they're 15,000 square feet, not even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| So I just think there's plenty enough room to put three houses on this lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| Thank you. Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Thank you, Madam Chair, and this is just a general statement to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| This is why, before I was even elected, I was advocating for some sort of concept plan at the time of a rezoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4044)|
| 1:07:36| Because nine times out of ten, the applicant knows exactly what they're going to do with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| and we wouldn't be having these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| And so as we move through advanced NOGs, I hope you all will support that during the rezoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4065)|
| 1:07:52| we do require some sort of concept plan, design plan, something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4072)|
| 1:08:01| Thank you. Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| The motion on the floor is to approve PR zone up to 1.2 dwelling units per acre by Commissioner Beeler with a second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4084)|
| 1:08:16| All those in favor say aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Select the new project, sir. Don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4103)|

| 1:09:00| Seeing none, Ms. Brooks, will you please give us Planning Commission's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve RA Low Density Residential Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| because it is consistent with the surrounding development and sector plan by a vote of 13-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4155)|

| 1:09:20| Yes, but I do have a question about Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| Can I ask about Washington Pike because I wasn't really sure about the exact answer or the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4163)|
| 1:09:31| Was it approved for three lots or was it approved for two lots only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| Mr. Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| I can answer. 1.2 was the density that was approved, 1.2 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| So two homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| You speak to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| We're just building two residential homes for sale for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| Commissioners, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Appreciate the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| This was the one that I was concerned about at BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| and you promised that you won't ask any variances there, so I'm good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4210)|
| 1:10:19| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Just to echo Commissioner Daley, we don't like to see applicants causing their hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| and then bring them before BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| So just to echo what he said, just be aware of those variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| We don't want to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| We don't want to see you guys either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Seeing no more discussion, I'll defer to District 3 Commissioner, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| Okay, you're finally in my district now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| I did actually talk to Alexander yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| and he confirmed that you're just doing two single-family homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| So I'm going to make a motion to approve the RA zone because it's consistent with surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| and sector plan, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4263)|

| 1:19:34| This question is for Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| Mr. Snowden, would engineering have concerns if someone is trying to develop a high density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4780)|
| 1:19:49| residential unit based on a top of a demolition landfill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4789)|
| 1:19:58| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| That's a risk that can be mitigated by the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| Obviously, that's a financial decision for them, but those things can be mitigated through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| different ways of excavation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| So, they would basically have to take off the top surface, dig out all the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| materials that are in the ground, and then bring in loads of dirt and fill that in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| make it stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Potentially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| I mean, our codes department inspects all footing installations, so they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| to be good sound material for us to approve that footing installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| Would you guys require a core sample before you would issue any kind of building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| to make sure that that has been, because I would have trepidations approving a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| on a demolition landfill, particularly for residential use where that property could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| Yeah, the way our ordinance is written now, the only time we can require a geotech analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4852)|
| 1:21:00| is if they are placing a lot of field, because obviously we want to make sure that field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| doesn't subside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| So, in this case, I don't necessarily think we could require that, but we certainly would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| make sure that any footings that were put on grade would be suitable for the foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| And the owner is fully aware of what they're getting into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4884)|

| 1:21:31| I talked to a builder and told him what was happening, and he knows about the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| and he said that, like Mr. Snowden said, the footers may have to be wider and deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| to account for all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| And the buyer knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| So, it's just more expensive construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| The motion on the floor is to approve planned residential zoning up to eight dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=4914)|

| 1:27:07| I had one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| So it's for the daycare, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| That's really why it all started, was for the daycare, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5233)|

| 1:29:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5385)|

| 1:30:02| I'm a civil engineer and a rule follower, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5402)|

| 1:30:09| Assuming we're the engineer on the project, we'll design it within the Knox County stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5409)|
| 1:30:15| We've been using permeable pavers, infiltration basins, rain gardens, those sorts of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5415)|

| 1:30:26| It's a pretty robust stormwater ordinance that we have to stick to, so we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5426)|
| 1:30:33| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| The CA zoning doesn't have lighting or landscape design standards, and it allows substantial signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| Was neighborhood commercial considered at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| We worked with Mike Reynolds in planning to land on this zone for the vision that Mr. Crony had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| so I'm not sure what other ones would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5453)|
| 1:31:01| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5461)|

| 1:31:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| Did you state what's going on with this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| Mr. Crony, his vision is to do some apartments on the backside and some commercial on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| kind of an internal, pedestrian-friendly recreational area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| That can communicate with the restaurant on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5486)|
| 1:31:33| That's the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| There was a concept plan that we submitted with the rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| to kind of give an idea of what he was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| And then all access will be on John Sevier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5505)|

| 1:32:00| and provide better access for the entire corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5525)|

| 1:34:33| R, B is a heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| There is a lot of flooding there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| The soccer fields just down from this property does flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5681)|
| 1:34:49| But it's down from the property, I'm sure, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5689)|
| 1:34:58| Yeah, you all see the soccer fields there down below it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| Across the street there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Go back up, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| Or back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| There you go, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| That piece of property right across the street had to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| Richie, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| Three foot, four foot tall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| To be usable because of the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5714)|
| 1:35:25| Mr. Snowden, do you see any problem with the flooding there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| I mean, I know where storm water will be on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| Yeah, I don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| Mr. Smith talks about compliance with our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| but one of the reasons the floodplain gets a lot wider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| I guess, downstream there is the elevations are a lot less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| He sits up a little higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| so I don't believe necessarily that he'll have the same challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| as some of the properties where those soccer fields are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| Mr. Smith knows that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| That challenge is there on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| While you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| do you have any heartburn going to PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| I'm not as familiar with that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| The density that the owner is looking for is 12 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| for that back portion for his apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| and that's kind of what we've shot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| That's kind of what we've shown in that site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| what the property would yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| So I would assume that the PR would allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| Would it allow 12, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| Yeah, 12 units per acre on the residential part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| is kind of what he's wanting to do on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| That's the only heartburn I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| is I'm not familiar with that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| I want to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| You're wanting...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| You're asking for 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| That's what we've got on our concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Amy, can he do 12 at PR, just to confirm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| He can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| I'm ready to make a motion if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Let me find it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Approving the CA general business zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| for the portion of parcels 08, 03, 02,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| and PR and F floodway zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| for another portion of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| because it is a minor extension of the existing commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5851)|
| 1:37:37| So it's not RB, it's PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5859)|
| 1:37:52| Motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| is to approve the CA general business zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| for a portion of parcel 08, 03, 08, 02,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| and PR planned residential and F floodway zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| for another portion of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| because it is a minor extension of an existing commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| Bye, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| With a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| Commissioner...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| I mean, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| Mr. Director Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| Thank you for the promotion, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| Amy, I want to ask you what I was asking you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| Has Planning Commission at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| considered PR for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| My understanding is that they did not have that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| of consideration of PR on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| I hate to insert myself in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| and I'll just interject for your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| that normally, if we're going to do a zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| it needs to be considered by the Planning Commission first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| They considered RB, they approved RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| to come up with PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| without it having been in front of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| This is the second time this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| It happened on the tailors on the Karate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| where they didn't consider transition zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| So we got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| Sounds like we got a problem in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| That they're not considering all options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| And they can't obviously consider every option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| But my concern is just that if they didn't consider...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| I mean, we've gone from RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| that has no density limitation effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| to PR with 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| And that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| except Planning Commission hasn't considered PR at 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| Normally, nobody challenges it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| I guess no harm, no foul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| But if somebody were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| the courts generally say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| that we don't have to pay attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| to what Planning Commission says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| but we have to get their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| If they could come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| we don't like PR, we want RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| And at that point, this commission could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| well, too bad, we're the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| we're going to do PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| But it can be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| if they haven't considered it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| Now, RB and PR are sufficiently close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| maybe it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| It's not the same as they considered RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| and we're going to do CA or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| But still, normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| you want Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| to at least look at that as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| I'm not telling you you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| I'm just for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| Okay, since you tell me I can't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| I'm going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Motion stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| Motion stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| Are we going to include up to 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| Any kind of density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| Well, PR is up to 12 anyway, correct, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| You have to request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6040)|

| 1:47:34| The proposed zoning would allow up to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| However, the applicant is only proposing 2.2 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| Commissioners, any discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| Mr. Fraser, can you tell us a little bit about the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| what your intended uses are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| It's a residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| We're doing approximately right now our preliminary site plan is about 142 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6483)|
| 1:48:10| residential high-quality neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6495)|
| 1:48:23| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| I need to abstain from this one, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| I'm actually combining both of these as I'm speaking to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| When I first drove out on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| I almost had a heart attack because of the way that it lays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| But on the top, in fact, it is beautiful, overlooking the bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| and had a wonderful conversation with Ms. Walls about the plan for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| And we have jointly discussed and agreed to the 2.2 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6539)|
| 1:49:06| I'm very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| It's going to be very high-quality homes, brick and rock fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6548)|
| 1:49:18| And the thing I'm really excited about is it really does fit a niche in Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6558)|
| 1:49:27| because, in fact, we lack homes in the roughly mid-fives price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6567)|
| 1:49:35| We go from more of a starter or a second home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| and then we jump into million-dollar homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| So this will really be a good thing for our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| And, in fact, it's one of these developments that, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| I think from the road you won't even see it, barely see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| because of the slope at the beginning of the property forces the whole development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6598)|
| 1:50:05| up on the very, very wooded ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| So I would like to go ahead and propose that we accept this recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| planning commission from a to – or, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6614)|

| 1:50:39| with a second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| Madam Chair, I had a question for Director Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| and really it kind of gets into zoning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| The traffic impact letter talks about maintaining the same level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| With 1,900 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| Is that likely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| I think it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| I would hate to kind of really speak in on it until –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| obviously this is a traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| We'll receive a traffic impact analysis with the 130 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| so there will be a lot more robust analysis done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| One of the things that we've actually talked to TDOT about, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| is their improvement at the interchange that's to the west of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| Their termini stops before West Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| so I'm trying to get them to extend their improvement to allow for that left turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| onto West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| There's some other conversations ongoing that might be a help to this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| I don't want to speak too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| but I think we can definitely work with our traffic engineer to mitigate any of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6706)|

| 1:53:23| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| I know that not all of this property is actually usable or buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6804)|

| 1:53:35| Was that also discussed in your conversations, Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6815)|

| 1:53:43| No, we did not discuss the 1.83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6823)|

| 1:56:18| Mr. Forrester, would you like to speak to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| This small section is part of a substantially larger parcel that actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6983)|
| 1:56:30| I can't see the road name there, but it actually crosses both sides of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| but part of this property already has the appropriate sector plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| which is CA, and we're asking for the area in blue, which is barely half an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| to be brought into that as just a minor extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| The area that has the CA designation, the size of it really doesn't allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| for any kind of appropriate commercial-style development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| This is a commercial node in kind of, I would say, more of a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7016)|
| 1:57:02| It's maybe one of the limited commercial nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| It's a very popular commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| It has post office, fire station, market, deli, and church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| I believe there is demand for some commercial retail to support the residents of this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| not only this commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| I would submit that it satisfies the requirements for a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| but no opposition on this item, either planning commission or here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7043)|

| 1:57:43| What do you plan to do with the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| I mean, it's .53 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| So, it will be an acre and a half, two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| but the portion that comes to the corner of the right-of-way there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| that's part of the property that we're going to subdivide out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| from this larger multi-acre track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| So, this .5 acres allows us, there's a children's branch stream there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7083)|
| 1:58:09| allows us to handle our stormwater in a more appropriate manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| to collect it with permeable pavers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| versus having to install any kind of large retention type area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7096)|

| 2:03:25| I'm trying to find the acreage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| Close to two and a half acres, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| Two point four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7413)|

| 2:03:39| Twelve homes, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7426)|

| 2:03:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7431)|

| 2:04:09| We are having a lot of growth on Fox Road and it's really having a hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7449)|

| 2:04:20| So I've been pretty concerned just hearing from the residents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| especially going five on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| I think that I'm the most comfortable at three units per acre as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| five only because George Williams and Fox Road is just really, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7473)|
| 2:04:40| having a tough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| Matter of fact, Director Snowden and I have been over to George Williams a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7483)|

| 2:04:50| stuff, and Fox Road is the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| So I think that's where I'm going to have to give you the three units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| acre on that instead of the five of what you guys are looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7498)|
| 2:05:06| And I apologize for that, but it's just from what all of the neighbors are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| saying and just the traffic on Fox Road just makes me really uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7510)|
| 2:05:16| So is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| Yeah, I will make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| So the motion is three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7518)|

| 2:06:48| Mr. Stewart, would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| Just to say that the area, it would suit a light manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7611)|
| 2:07:04| The plan is to put retail up toward the road and then potentially a light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7624)|
| 2:07:11| manufacturing facility behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| It's just we've been trying to develop the property for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| It's kind of odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| We think we've got a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| So that's the motivation for bringing this before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7647)|

| 2:07:32| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| I just want to, on this one, bring commission's attention to this is the CB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7655)|
| 2:07:41| and we don't see a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| The CA and CB are less preferred zones now due to generally a lack of standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7662)|
| 2:07:49| around landscaping, lighting, noise, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| And then particularly when I was looking at the CB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| the description is actually, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| illustrative of why this might not be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| In the description of the actual zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| it says the nature of such businesses here is to attract large volumes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7687)|
| 2:08:13| automobile and truck traffic and have adverse effects on surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| Hence, they're not appropriately associated with nor compatible with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| Now, right to the south, you can see a bunch of pink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| which is planned residential for dwelling units and acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| You can see ag just to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| And then the PR slot that doesn't have a density on it, that was actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| they just had a concept plan at the same planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| So there's a condition that was proposed to add a 20-foot landscaping buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7718)|
| 2:08:44| for adjacent residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| That was a condition planning commission put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| But there are no other conditions or anything that limit this to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| a light manufacturing use or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| So just keep in mind that there's a lot of uses allowed in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| ordinance that could be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| You know, once you rezone, they put in the landscaping buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| and then there's a lot of uses that can be just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| pull a building permit for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Would you like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| I mean, the landscaping buffer, the 20 feet, it's on the south and west sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| I mean, we would do that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| There is a whole lot of development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| This is very near that intersection, fairly busy intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| It's not going to encroach on the residential at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| We intend to develop it in a way that it supports the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| not detracts from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| That wouldn't serve our purposes at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7783)|

| 2:10:25| My understanding, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| I wasn't there for the internal staff conversations on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| but that that wasn't discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| And to my recollection, it wasn't discussed either at Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| But did the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| you don't know if the planning staff even mulled that idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| No, I think it was more of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| probably the debate of whether or not to extend the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| allow extension of the CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| But is this not a prime example of where neighborhood commercial would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| ideal because he's talking about commercial on the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| I think it would take additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| I would want to take a closer look at this one in the context of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| neighborhood commercial for the specific site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| since it wasn't requested or discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7873)|
| 2:11:19| Could anyone else have discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| I drive through there quite often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| and I don't think it's a bad choice for CB or neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7895)|
| 2:11:41| either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| It's just whatever fits the gentleman's plan the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| which we don't know what that plan is yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| Do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7908)|
| 2:11:49| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| I'm not aware of what neighborhood commercial is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7910)|
| 2:11:56| You're limited neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| If you're trying to build a gas station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| like the shale across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| you can't do that neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| but you do it in general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| It would require more intense design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| which is something that we would actually like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| Well, I just wasn't aware of it when I made the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| In reviewing everything and looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| this suited what the potential buyer wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7944)|
| 2:12:32| To be honest with you, CA was very close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| but it's kind of a gray area because it is a light manufacturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| and so I thought the best approach would be to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| and see if the zoning would be acceptable to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7962)|
| 2:12:48| I mean, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| I mean, I want to make a nice piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| I want to put it to its highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| I don't see a gas station or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| It's going to look attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| It's going to have a nice barrier between the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| There's nothing, even though there's going to be a barrier on that side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| there's really nothing behind it, like away from dry gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| It's all commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| Like there's construction and a crossfit there on Cunningham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| and then what I'm planning is something nice along the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=7996)|
| 2:13:25| and then be able to do some light manufacturing in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8005)|
| 2:13:31| Director Brooks, is CB, does it have lighting requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8011)|
| 2:13:38| There's no lighting requirements in the CB zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| That's the only concern that I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| is that the PR that's going in beside you there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| you will have that 20-foot buffer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| We don't need any light pollution because those neighbors will have a backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| The street, of course, will be lit on the front side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| but the backside of that neighbor's is their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| I don't think that's going to be an issue just because of the way it's the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| That would be the backside of whatever we put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| so I don't think that would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| There would be vegetation in the backside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| so I don't anticipate that being an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8051)|
| 2:14:20| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| Can you guarantee this body that it would be an environment free of noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| odor, or congestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| I can't guarantee that about this room or anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| It's not going to be like a rock crushing plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| I'm not going to let something like that go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| It's going to be, well, I don't care to tell the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| the gentleman I'm talking to manufactures an artificial stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| sells it all over the country that actually works better than brick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| and looks better than stone, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| but it's got a weep system behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| There will be some dust that won't leave the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| but it just didn't quite fit CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| I didn't think, and so that's why I've applied for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8107)|
| 2:15:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| So you've got the gas station there on the corner and that gym across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| street, a CrossFit place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| And then there's a landscaping place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| No, I think that's going the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| So where would you enter from, on High School or Cunningham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| No, okay, so if you're coming up to that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| I think it's Cunningham, or no, it's Beaver Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8140)|
| 2:15:47| and then I always get those flipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| So when you're on East Beaver Creek, the gas station's on your left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| CrossFit's on your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| If you turn right on Dry Gap, there's actually two entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| One was for the farmhouse and then one was on down toward the barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| And there's a sidewalk all the way down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| So as far as the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| we can put it pretty much anywhere down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| Obviously we'd want to place it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| in conjunction with staff where it would be the least intrusive to traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| and would serve the site the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| We've also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| I'm trying to talk to the gentleman who owns the commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| There's like a construction yard behind the CrossFit to see about getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| potentially access to the backside of the property off Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8189)|
| 2:16:36| I don't know if that's going to happen or not, but I'm going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8196)|
| 2:16:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| Mr. Snowden, were you at the January NOx planning meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| Since you were not present, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| You were there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| Oh, well, I'm reading the minutes here from that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| and there was a motion made to deny the rezoning to CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8221)|
| 2:17:07| and it was a six to seven vote, which you don't see that very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| So do you remember why the planning commissioners initially voted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8232)|
| 2:17:17| or attempted to, to deny that, although it lost by one vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8237)|
| 2:17:22| Do you remember that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| I don't have that good a memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| Yeah, I don't recall any specifics regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| Well, let me let the staff, since she's our authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| I think it's based on a lot of the discussion that you all are already having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| in terms of the intensity of the use and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| extending that intensity further down into the closer to these residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8262)|
| 2:17:48| Okay, because it was next to the residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| If I could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| What I recall, I don't recall any discussion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| It was about the vegetation barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| That was prior to the condition for the vegetation barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| They had a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| It was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8286)|
| 2:18:07| But once it was settled on the vegetation barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| they were questioning me about whether I was okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| Of course I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8293)|
| 2:18:14| And then I think it passed 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| I have a question, Mr. Wall Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| So could I make a motion to change it to neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8311)|
| 2:18:37| Is that permittable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| Well, it's the same as the one earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| From what I can tell, neighborhood commercial was not asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| was not considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| Is that correct, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| Was neighborhood commercial ever considered for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| So it's Commissioner Frazier was talking about precedent earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| We set a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| No, we just go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| So it's close enough, but it's a very different zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| It's a zone that goes from certain kinds of uses and very little planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8346)|
| 2:19:12| to a different kind of zone that has different kinds of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| and different requirements for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| Again, normally this is the kind of thing that you'd put in front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| planning commission before, whether they rejected it or accepted it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| you get their input on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| But if Mr. Stewart can live with neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8371)|
| 2:19:43| if I were Mr. Stewart, I'd probably want to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| and he doesn't have the authority to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| but since we're bringing up a new proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| he might want to consider himself whether neighborhood commercial will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| what he wants it to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8397)|
| 2:19:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8398)|
| 2:19:59| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8399)|
| 2:20:00| Amy, could you do that kind of manufacturing in neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| I've got it pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| The general description of neighborhood commercial provides opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| locate limited retail and service uses in a manner convenient to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| and yet not disrupted to establish residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| is intended to provide for the recurring shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| and personal service needs of nearby residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| You get into uses permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| You've got grocery stores, household supplies, clothing, shoes, garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| drugs and medicines, small appliance, baked goods, delicatessens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| Business and personal services, beauty and barber shops, laundry, banks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| laundromats, business professional, travel, finance, accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| veterinary clinic, wireless communication facilities, demolition landfills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8445)|
| 2:20:52| It's the opposite direction of what he wants to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| It would be a down zone than an up zone for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| That's not the direction he wants at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| I just wanted you to be aware of, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| You're better off at keeping it at CA than down zoning it to neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| I didn't recognize the nomenclature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| I actually read that and looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| The only thing I saw that fit what we're trying to do is the CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| And I hope you do see that our concerns are really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8476)|
| 2:21:21| You're not being recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| We follow Robert's rules of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| Mr. Lee's got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| I guess I'm kind of concerned about this because that neighborhood behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8490)|
| 2:21:37| and it kind of being out of character, not consistent with what's currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8501)|
| 2:21:42| Well, our goal is to make it consistent with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| We're not looking to come in and drop an eye sore and we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8509)|
| 2:21:50| That's why I was talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8510)|
| 2:21:51| It'll be more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8511)|
| 2:21:52| something more retail up toward the road that'll fit the neighborhood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| that with the vegetation barrier and it's going to look nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| But the way the property situated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| that's why I was talking about the access from Beaver Creek is so that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| could have the manufacturing actually behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| So like in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| if I'm able to put this deal together with the potential buyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8532)|
| 2:22:17| or I don't know if he's going to buy a rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| if we're going to develop it for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| but it would be the manufacturing in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8541)|
| 2:22:26| And then he would have a display area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| like a nice store up front because that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| that road gets a whole lot of traffic and we want it to make it look nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| I mean, that area is really coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| It's developed wonderfully in the last 10, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8556)|
| 2:22:41| I mean, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8561)|
| 2:22:42| there's a lot going on out there and we want to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8562)|
| 2:22:50| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| I don't think we could do it there, but if you look at the aerial view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| you will see the neighboring PR parcels has not been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8578)|
| 2:23:11| Actually, I think that's, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8591)|
| 2:23:15| I think, I think that's an old photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| So all the woods you see to the, I guess that's the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8598)|
| 2:23:23| That's all gone now. That's been, that's a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| It's, it's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| Commissioner Frazier, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8613)|
| 2:23:38| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| Thank you. Yes, it is being developed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| Actually, they're doing a lot of grading across the road and on your side of the road also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8629)|
| 2:23:50| Kind of where that red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| That one little house across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| And you can see the dry gaps actually divided there in front of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8635)|
| 2:23:59| It's, it's wider. It's kind of got a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| I mean, it's, it's, it's, I think it's well suited for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| Mr. Lee, the reason I went ahead and did mine, our B is not a good zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8645)|
| 2:24:11| Because it's the, the property owner can go in and start grading without any type of plans or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8651)|
| 2:24:19| So that's why I asked for PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8659)|
| 2:24:20| It's still basically the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| CB and CA is totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8662)|
| 2:24:25| So our NC neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| So I wouldn't recommend trying to change it to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| Best thing to do is, and we've already said it's not going to fit his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8672)|
| 2:24:37| You could send it back on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| You would send it back for them to discuss neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| But it's not going to fit his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8683)|
| 2:24:50| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| Is there an issue if it comes from us as far as returning this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8698)|
| 2:25:04| Because I do have some concerns that we're talking about some zoning he's not at all familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| Are you asking if it's, if it's okay for you to send it back to Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8714)|
| 2:25:15| Us, for us to send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| So that he's not in any way penalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8718)|
| 2:25:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8719)|
| 2:25:20| That's totally fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| That's when I would make a motion to send it back to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| For consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| Oh, I would make a motion to send it back to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8729)|
| 2:25:35| We need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8735)|
| 2:25:36| We need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| Do we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| To give them some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| I mean, again, the reason that we're talking about it is to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8740)|
| 2:25:44| I think neighborhood commercial but we've already kind of determined that that won't suit Mr. Stewart's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8744)|
| 2:25:50| So I'm not sure that I'm not sure what it does to send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8750)|
| 2:25:55| And actually neighborhood commercial would be downgrading it from what it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| So it'd be less commercial, not more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| And so that that wouldn't work for us at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| Could we to explore any other options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| There's there's a limited universe of what those options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| But if that's if that's what you wish to do, it's certainly within your purview to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8774)|
| 2:26:20| That's what I'd make a motion for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| Explore all of our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| The only problem is there isn't another option, but there's only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| It's either this or it stays what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8791)|
| 2:26:39| Yes, motion is to send back to planning planning commission to explore other potential zoning options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8799)|
| 2:26:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| By Commissioner Lee with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| The gentleman's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| There's only what he brought is his option, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8817)|
| 2:27:04| And then down zoning is not what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| So it's either he keeps it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| You deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| If you don't want to give it to me, you deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| And he stays where he's at at C.A. or you can improve it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8831)|
| 2:27:16| We're just punting him back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| He's going to go in front of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| He's going to be like, I don't want to be down zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| And the only up zone is the one they already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| So what are we really asking planning to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| Like give them industrial because they're not going to prove industrial, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| There's a limited amount of options that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| And the option that he wants is the option that's in front of us, which is the option that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8855)|
| 2:27:41| I don't see any point of sending it back down to I don't even know what planning commission would even say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8861)|
| 2:27:49| Because he's not going to consider down zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8869)|
| 2:27:54| And it's his money that he's paying to have commission and planning to analyze the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8874)|
| 2:28:03| So I feel like we're wasting his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| And if you don't want to give it to him, then fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| Just vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8887)|
| 2:28:08| Don't give him the I don't I think wasting his time is it's not polite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8888)|
| 2:28:14| It's the best way for me to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8894)|
| 2:28:20| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| I just want to recognize Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8904)|
| 2:28:25| He asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| And for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| Stewart, maybe what you're looking for, if there are some conditions that maybe planning commission should have thought and added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8910)|
| 2:28:36| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8916)|
| 2:28:37| Originally, you could ask them to do things like a lighting condition, landscaping, noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8917)|
| 2:28:46| And you could even consider potentially asking if there's a condition on limiting it to some of the uses in CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8926)|
| 2:28:52| I was looking through the ordinance and there's not a great zone for light industrial on small parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8932)|
| 2:28:58| Like I was looking and it's like, well, planned commercial is the one you might want to look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8938)|
| 2:29:02| But that says, you know, you're looking at more like 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| So I think it's I think commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| I still find commission struggle with it, but they didn't go and actually work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| Are there some more conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8951)|
| 2:29:12| And I've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| There's one I saw several years ago that was they zoned it up for the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| But then they said, but we want to apply the neighborhood commercial landscaping, lighting and signage and a couple of other things to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8958)|
| 2:29:27| So it was a fairly simple condition to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| So that may be what you're looking for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| Like we can apply like if you want to make sure he has a 20 foot buffer on one side or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8972)|
| 2:29:37| You guys have more than the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| You want to say that he can't have lighting on the back side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| We are allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| We're allowed to do whatever we want to a certain degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| I don't think if we're going to send it back, I would say, can you send it back to announce to analyze the conditions that would be applied to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8988)|
| 2:29:55| Not just, hey, take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| And with no direction, I think the responsible thing would be to send it back to planning commission with, hey, are there any conditions that would make this a more comfortable or palatable property zoning to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=8998)|
| 2:30:17| Or we could discuss it here and apply it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9017)|
| 2:30:22| Again, I don't want to waste the gentleman's time and money by jerking him around and trying to force him into something that he doesn't want or is not good for his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9022)|
| 2:30:33| So I just want to make sure that we're being responsible with his time and his money as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9033)|
| 2:30:40| I'm not exactly familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| Exactly what the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| Saying no lighting on the back of the building that would shine over on the neighborhood, that's not going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| As far as landscaping, we're going to landscape it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| So if that were a condition, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| I'd rather not spend going back and back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| I mean, if there are conditions, I mean, it was recommended by staff at past, you know, NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| I just like to get it done so we can move, you know, maybe move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9069)|
| 2:31:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9077)|
| 2:31:18| Well, I mean, I see the applicant doesn't really want to go back to planning commission as I was going to make a couple of suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9078)|
| 2:31:27| One suggestion would have been to modify the motion to ask for additional conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9087)|
| 2:31:35| But I mean, would it be appropriate if someone wanted to offer a substitute motion to either approve it or deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9095)|
| 2:31:47| That way we're not, I mean, we could at least get a chance to vote on the matter being settled and it not going back to plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9107)|
| 2:31:57| Just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9119)|
| 2:32:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9120)|
| 2:32:03| My concern with that, Commissioner Beeler and Commissioner Ward, is that once you're denied, you're denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9123)|
| 2:32:13| And if, I hope you will consider it a potential courtesy to give this option to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9133)|
| 2:32:22| And if you want to narrow parameters in a substitute motion, that certainly is, you know, I have no objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9142)|
| 2:32:30| But I just, I don't want to see you just throw it out and I don't want to see you locked into conditions that are just arbitrarily dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9150)|
| 2:32:40| If it's not really in your best interest also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9160)|
| 2:32:43| So that really is just a suggestion to give you and planning another chance to kind of take a deep breath and re-look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9163)|
| 2:32:53| If, you know, if that's not your preference, you don't have to take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| But if we deny it, then you're dead, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| So that's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9182)|
| 2:33:07| I'll amend my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9187)|
| 2:33:10| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| I'll amend my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9193)|

| 2:33:21| Ms. Brooks, I'm trying to remember the items that we've kicked back to Knox Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9201)|
| 2:33:29| Historically, they've just stuck with their same decision, have they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9209)|
| 2:33:35| I don't recall all of them, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| But, you know, to go back to what Commissioner Ward was saying a few minutes ago, if there are certain things that you all want them to consider, please itemize those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9218)|
| 2:33:49| Like we want, these are our concerns with this particular zoning and we want you all to look at lighting, noise, additional buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9229)|
| 2:33:58| Just be very specific on what you'd like for them to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9238)|

| 2:34:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9242)|

| 2:34:30| I travel it every three or four times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| These trees are mature, large mature trees are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9273)|
| 2:34:37| They're not going to be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| So, I'm going to make a substitute motion that the Planning Commission's recommendation approve the CB business and manufacturing zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9279)|
