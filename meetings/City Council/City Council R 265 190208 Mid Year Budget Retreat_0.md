| 0:00:30| So good morning, everyone. Thank you to this annual budget retreat with City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| Council. This is something that we've done every year since I became mayor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=35)|
| 0:00:42| I believe the former mayors did it as well. I want to welcome everybody to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=42)|
| 0:00:49| event today. This is a public meeting, of course, and I first want to say to City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=49)|
| 0:00:56| Council or to make sure people know that City Council was in a workshop until 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| p.m. last night. So I want to thank you for your commitment. Yes, so we'll make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=61)|
| 0:01:12| sure we have a lot of coffee, but thank you. That was the recode workshop, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| first recode workshop, and there will be more, but I want to thank you for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| work that you did on that and thank you for showing up today for the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| retreat. You're certainly earning your meager salaries these two days, but I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| want to make sure everybody knows we are really happy that CTV is also here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| they are filming us today. So are we live or we're just... He nodded his head. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| live. We're live. All right, very good, and it will also be recorded and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| available for people in the future to see. So you have an agenda before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| you. If you look at it, after my introduction, we will have the mid-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=118)|
| 0:02:08| financial update from our Senior Finance Director, Jim York, and then David and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| Bill, David Brace and Bill Lyons will lead us in an overview of our various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=134)|
| 0:02:23| programs, projects, and services. This is just a small sample of the work that, by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=143)|
| 0:02:31| the way, these really talented people, if you look behind me, we have a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| staff, and when I walked in and I see these faces, I feel really fortunate as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| mayor to have such an outstanding staff, both my senior staff who are around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| table here with council, but all of the staff in this room. We have great talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| serving in this city, serving the residents of this city through our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| government. So I want to give a round of applause to our talent behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| So every year, as we are both looking at our mid-year review and as we plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=183)|
| 0:03:15| the new budget, there are challenges that we have to face, and we have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| prepared to do those, but there's also opportunities that we can't let go by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| and so that's what, you know, we're always focusing on both the most basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| services that are critical, but also how do we move Knoxville forward and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| people with it, right, the people that we have to invest in and that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| responsible to. So today we're going to start with the mid-year review, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| we'll go into some discussion of some of our ongoing projects and some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| opportunities that we have, and then we'll have, throughout all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| this, there's time for discussion, and then certainly time for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| afterwards. So any questions from anybody before we get started? All right, so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| going to hand this over to Jim York, our finance director, and if anybody sees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| counsel heading to the coffee make way for them, they will need it more than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| rest of us. There's something wrong with putting the finance director on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| When council members have been been up late the night before. I've done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| many times. I think this is my 31st time here with the city of Knoxville. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| also my last one, so, but just note that that clapping is fake. Most of them are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=277)|
| 0:04:48| probably saying, thank God it's over. But anyway, so if you fall asleep, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=288)|
| 0:04:55| doesn't bother me, you know. Now they dim the lights. Really putting me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| up to a different standard. I'm going to say that one of the nicer things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=303)|
| 0:05:11| that people say about me is that I'm a Scrooge. That's one of the few I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| repeat, so, and so when we talk today, I'm going to do a past, present, and future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=315)|
| 0:05:24| So just think of it in that term. The other thing that I do want, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| have have learned this in my time here, is it please ask questions because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| can go goes a whole lot better when when people are asking questions and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| engaged in this process. Okay, so for the past, we're going to talk first about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| last year and where, again, we're going to focus on the general fund. Here is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| general fund ending fund balance since the July or June 30th of 2010. At that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=355)|
| 0:06:06| point, it was around 60.6 million. It peaked here at the end of fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| 17 at around 94.6, and it, last year, it dropped to 84.4. That's a drop of around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=374)|
| 0:06:25| 9.85 million, and again, we're going to talk about where we thought we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| going to be as well. A year ago, when we were here, we were forecasting that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| that would decline by about 17.8 million dollars, so again, we only went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=396)|
| 0:06:44| down by about a little over 9 million dollars. Now, most of that change is due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=404)|
| 0:06:52| to the Hall income tax, and you're going to hear me talk about Hall income tax a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| bunch today, mostly because it's going away, but had the Hall income tax come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=415)|
| 0:07:03| exactly as proposed, we would have been in about 16, a little over 16.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| dollars down for the year. So again, that one revenue source, which is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| volatile and which is going away, basically had a significant impact on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| ending fund balance for last year. In terms of where we forecast, if you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| take that one out of the equations, our forecast was off by about six-tenths of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| one percent. We underestimated our revenues. We also underestimated our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| expenditures by about the same amount. Both of them are about six-tenths of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| percent, so again, in that range, it's pretty close except for that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| revenue source. So, any questions about where we did last year or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| before I get into this year? Well, I just want to make the point, and it'll show on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| the next page, I believe, that of your fund balance, the amount of the fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| balance over the committed and assigned is really our opportunity fund, is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| we call it. Because, you know, when you see it going down, there's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=489)|
| 0:08:17| line that should be across there that shows this is really what we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| have to be prepared for any downturns or whatever, and what we've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| committed to other projects. And the rest of it is what we use when there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| opportunities, right? When there are investments that we need to make. So, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| not bad news that it is going down that way. It's because we have used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| it to invest, and some of it is, basically, because we've used it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| invest in projects that will create a return on investment to us as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| community. Okay. Jim, when does the all-income tax expire? 2021, you'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=532)|
| 0:09:02| doing, Council will be doing the 2021 budget, or 21-22 budget, and for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| budget, you will have no all-income tax. Councilwoman Welch, did you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| question? Yes, Mayor, thank you. So, where is that line? Sort of what's the... He's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| going to show you here, in this one here. Jim, let me ask you real quick, since we're on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| all-income tax. So, you said without, if we fast forward to 2021 right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| there'd be 16 million dollars difference. Had we been, last year we forecast 4.9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| it came in a little, about 11 and a half. So, it came in really hefty last year. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| was shocked at how big it was. I think most people were. So, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| question is, the amount that you see from the all-income tax, does that vary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| Oh, you're going to see a slide here. It looks like it's crazy. It's all over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| course. I've told the Mayor this, and I'm going to tell, you know, I've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| this for 40 years. I have never seen a revenue that big fluctuate. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| crazy, in terms of, it's all over the board, truly. Okay. So, we know it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| away. Yes, we do. We've been talking about it for a long time, anticipating. But, we also... Could you all pull your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| microphone close, so it can be picked up, and for CTV and all, it has to be really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| I think we used to be 500 tons, and I've had 500 hours of sleep here. Can't pick it up. Okay. So, we know that the fund's going away, we know it's going to zero, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=622)|
| 0:10:33| also know, in terms of projecting for next year, that everybody's returns right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| now on investments are terrible, in the negatives, is what I'm seeing. So, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| going to probably really impact any Hall income tax revenue for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| Okay. Just so you know, okay, let's talk about the Hall income tax. The Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| income tax that we receive in the current year is based on the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| calendar year. Okay. So, what you receive for, what we receive for the 19-20 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=660)|
| 0:11:08| will be based on calendar year 19. Okay. So, there is a lag, just got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| understand that lag. Okay. Okay. Now, I can't tell you what the market's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| do, you know, I don't know that anybody could. If I could, I wouldn't be standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| here. It's not doing real well right now. But, again, just to understand that. Also, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| would point out, and again, honestly, the market has a lot to do with it, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=689)|
| 0:11:38| have, my sense is, is that the Hall income tax that the city receives is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| based a lot on what we call escort distributions, and those could be totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| different than what the market did. Okay. So, now again, the market's going to play a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| part in that. The market was actually down for the whole calendar year as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| last year. But, again, the escort distributions could, could bump that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| up. Also, the escort distributions could knock it way down. It's just, again, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| hard. I can't really forecast what it's going to be, except in 2021, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=734)|
| 0:12:21| pretty easy. Now, my fear is, is at some point we're going to get hit hard. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| don't know when. Except, you know, in 2021, you know, that's an easy forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| But, and again, we've got charts here later on the Hall income tax to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| about. Let's talk a little bit about fund balance. We break the fund balance down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| into two different categories, because people say, you know, our fund balance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| like 85 million dollars. Yes, it is. Our total general fund fund balance is 85| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| million, but we start breaking it down. So, you need to kind of understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| There is a certain portion of our fund balance that is non-spendable. It relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| to prepaid expenses, inventory, you know, those two items. If you're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| interested, I can explain what prepaid items and, and the inventory, you know, are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| but I don't think you want to talk about that. We have encumbrances that, that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| be restricted, but mostly what we have is we have committed, committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| encumbrances, and we have assigned encumbrances. Okay. Encumbrances are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| things that we had in the pipeline at the end of the year, but they had not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| been completed. So, if we had a purchase order or a contract out last year, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| are either committed or assigned. Those are things that we know are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| happen, because we've already basically entered into some sort of legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| agreement, but they just didn't happen by the end of the year. So, we take those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| off the top of the fund balance. And again, you can look at last year, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| probably about four hundred and forty thousand dollars, give or take, last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| in total encumbrances in our general fund. Now, we have a policy. Our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| says that we will set aside twenty percent of whatever our total general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| fund budget and designate or commit to that and say basically we're taking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| off the table. The size of that for this year is about forty five point four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| million dollars. Okay. Now, going into the year for this year's budget, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=870)|
| 0:14:39| appropriated fund, a portion of fund balance. We've already said this is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| if things come in at the plan, this is where what we will use in fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| That's about eight million dollars. Okay. You start taking all that stuff off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| top, that brings you down to the unassigned fund balance. And for at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| end of last year, that was around thirty million. That is your unassigned fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| balance. It doesn't have any so-called restrictions on it. Right. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| what I refer to as the opportunity fund, the opportunity part of this. If there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| are opportunities that we know are good for investing in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| community that then returns, gives us a good return because of reinvestment, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| that's what we look to when as we are, and you'll see, you know, coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| this next budget and some of the things that Bill and David will talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| opportunities before us that we want to take advantage of. So the numbers we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| looking up here end at July 31. Yes, June 30. And so when you look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| actually, the unassigned or that opportunity, that varies across the, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| know, depending on the year and depending on what we've invested in in different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| projects. And it was 25 million, not 25.5 last year, 30.3 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| I see some confused faces. I contribute that to sleep, but deprivation. So any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=962)|
| 0:16:13| more questions before I go on on that? We're going to shift now. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| this is the end of Christmas past. So now we're going to go into Christmas present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| One slide before. Okay. We talked, I know we talked a lot about this, a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| bit about this last year, and that's bond rating agencies typically look at, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| kind of a third-party look at our finance, and they're really looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| our ability to pay off the existing debt. Our bond ratings, and we have three, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1001)|
| 0:16:49| Fitch, it's a triple A. That is the highest rating that anyone can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| receive, triple A. Okay, Moody's and S&P, Standard & Coors, everybody calls it S&P,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1014)|
| 0:17:03| have us rated at AA1 and AA plus, respectively. Those are the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| highest ratings. Now, again, that's a pretty, you know, again, the third-party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1029)|
| 0:17:17| look. When you're borrowing money, that's a very critical piece because, again, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| ratings go down, the interest rates that you pay will go up. And when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| borrowing millions and millions of dollars, every little bit, you know, has an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| impact on that. Now, just to give you... How long have we had that gem, that rating? We have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| that probably for, I want to say, 12 to 14 years. I could go back and look, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| it's been somewhere in that vicinity. No, our entire time. So, again, just to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| you some idea... And that's the highest, historically, right? It's the highest the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| city's had. It's the highest the city has had. The highest rating. The highest rating. To| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| give you some idea of what that is, again, and I've been here way too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| long, but when I came, I think we had a split rating. We were at an A- and an A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| Now, all A's sound good. A- is just two grades above investment grade. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1095)|
| 0:18:24| you go down one tick from A-, you're at BBB. That is what we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| investment grade bonds, which means banks can borrow, you know, loan to you. You drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| below that, you're considered what used to be called junk bonds. Now, it's called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| high-yield bonds. Well, you know, again, I've been around a long time. I can call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| them junk bonds. So, that gives you some idea of what this does. It takes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| long time to build it up. So, and again, these are the highest ratings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| are very rare. There are a lot of people that may have, you know, the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| highest ratings. In the state of Tennessee, including us, there are only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| seven governmental entities that have at least one triple A. Now, there are a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| couple that have more triple that are triple A across the board. Those are few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| and far between. But out of every municipality, and again, including the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| states, counties, and even utility districts, but utility districts would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| rare to have this kind of rating. There are only seven inside the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| Tennessee. So, again, it's a pretty good sign that people are looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| it. Now, again, I want to say that there are a couple of things that go into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| triple A or any ratings. Some things we control, some things we don't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| One is the local economy, how flexible it is, how dependent it is on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| one company or one entity. They look at our management style, you know, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| do we handle budgeting, how do we handle lots of things. And then they look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| actual raw numbers. So, again, they're going to look at those unassigned fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| balances, they're going to look at total fund balances, they're going to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| our debt ratios, and so forth. So, there are a lot of factors that go into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| We can maybe control some of those. We can't really control, you know, some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| the economic things. So, for example, I think I used this last year. Everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| familiar with Detroit. Detroit could have had the greatest management in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| They didn't have good numbers, so, but because of their economy and because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| their numbers, you know, they're going to be a pretty low bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| rating. Because, again, they can't do it. We talked, I think I talked again a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| ago, if you look at Alcoa, and Alcoa is a well-run city, but it's basically a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| one-horse town. Something happens to that one horse, they can't control it. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| going to be a lot harder for them to pump that up just because they're so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| dependent upon one entity. So, okay. Okay, now we're going to talk about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| mid-year status. Again, we're present through the end of December, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| this is all general fund. We had roughly 101 million in revenues and sources, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| we had spent roughly 112 million dollars at that point in time. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1295)|
| 0:21:44| basically, we were down about 10.9 million dollars. Again, that's not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| Again, in fact, that's probably better than it normally is. Again, one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| other reasons you have fund balance is for cash flow purposes. Again, and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| shouldn't forget this, the city's general fund has two months out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| year that are positive, and one month it can go either way. So, for at least nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| months out of the year, we're going to spend more than we take in. And why is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| that? Explain that. And really, the reason is because of property tax, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| going to spend a lot more time on property tax, but property tax come in at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| the end of October, and at the end of February, and then there's a little surge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| here at the end of December. And it's really like the last three days of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| October, and it may be the last week in February, but that's when a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| property tax comes in, and so those are positive cash flow months for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| Like I said, December can go either way. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| Now, mid-year status, and this is kind of a forecast of where I think we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1372)|
| 0:23:02| to be at the end of the year. Real property tax is going down, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| going down for, or we expect to end the year lower than what we expect, what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| budgeted. Last year, and we always, and again, there are two types of things. When we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| a budget, we're trying to forecast where things are going to be six to eighteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| months out, and trust me, we're going to be wrong on most of those things. We hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| to be close. Last year, we had forecast that we would have growth of like 1.38%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| growth in real property values. Our actual growth was 0.34%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1418)|
| 0:23:46| in growth in property tax. Again, there's a slide later that will talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| Okay. So we are expecting now, because our assessments came in much lower than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| what we had planned, that we're going to end the year negative in terms of real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| property. Okay. Now, the next one is probably one that I wouldn't normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| talk about, but I need to, I want to point out a couple of things. Lower than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| expected revenue from cable franchise fees. We get, last year, for this year, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| had budgeted 1.95 million from cable franchise fees. We're forecasting it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1459)|
| 0:24:26| going to be in the more 1.7 million range. Now, again, that's down. Again, 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| million, I wish, you know, a lot of people wish they had 2 million. 2 million is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| nothing to sneeze at, but in the scheme of things, it's not a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| revenue source, but it has some things that are very typical about a lot of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| revenue sources, and that is, if you think about this, the cable franchise fee is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| tax on cable TV. It is not a tax on Internet. Okay. Think of, and we have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| Millennials in here, think of what's happening. Millennials and even, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| a lot of people below that are cutting the cord. They're accessing, if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| watch TV, they're watching movies and TV through the Internet, not cable TV. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| what does that mean going forward? If you, if you just think about that, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| going to happen as we go forward, we're probably going to see either that flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| line or start going down, just because of change in demographics. There are a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| we have several revenues like that. If you take a, again, we talked a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| last year about gas tax, and gas tax for the last two years have gone up, but only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| because they've raised the rates, but if you look 20 and 30 years before, for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| last 20 or 30 years before they raised the rates, it was basically flatlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Didn't grow at all. I suspect that once we get through the next year when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| raising gas tax another penny, that that's going to happen again. Why does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| that happen? Look, everybody here, you know, probably think of, again, Millennials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| they don't know this, but if you, most people think about what kind of car they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| had 10, 10 or 15 years ago, compare your gas mileage on that car to what your gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| mileage is today. The gas tax is based on consumption of gasoline, and even if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| drive the same number of miles that you did 10 years ago, and that, that car that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| you had 10 or 15 years ago, and you're driving a different car, you're using a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| whole lot less gasoline, your gas taxes are flat, or down. You spend less on gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| I mean, I drive a hybrid car, you know, a lot of people are, you know, going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| electric cars, hybrid cars. You're going to see that happen on gas tax. Other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| states are facing the same problem. They're kind of addressing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| differently, but we have a lot of revenues that are kind of faced that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| that way. Yeah, we did have somebody who wanted to come in. Everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| welcome. Come on in. So, but, and again, these are, those are not the only two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| Beer tax. Again, the change in beer tax for, you know, collections. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| formerly based on price. State passed a law said, you know, now it's based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| consumption. The only way your beer tax rose, people have to drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| more beer. So, now maybe that's desirable, and maybe after your RECO meeting, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| that, you know, some of that went up last night, but I don't know about that. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| that is not an official recommendation. However, unofficially, it sounds good to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| I wouldn't know. I wasn't there. So, okay. So, so again, that's the only reason I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1672)|
| 0:28:02| point that out, because a lot of people say, well, what about other, other sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| of revenue? But we have a lot of restrictions on other sources of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| They're, they're kind of structured incorrectly. They're structured, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| probably when the cable franchise tax was enacted. That made good sense. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| market has changed. We're subject to the market just like everything else. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| Now, on the positive side, we're seeing higher than expected local option sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| taxes. Same thing on state shared sales taxes. We're seeing higher, higher, higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| on state shared sales tax. Business taxes, again, and, and we estimate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| because we really don't know, because we won't know until, until June. Last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| we didn't miss our estimate by very much. We said 6.72, and it came in like 6.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| million. It's almost 6.8 million. So, so we're pretty close, and we think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| that's going to be pretty much in line. Again, if you look historically, it kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| of stays in the range, too, but it is there. We are getting higher interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| earnings. That's because, again, we invest every dollar, single dollar that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| to try and earn interest. Interest rates are up. Now, again, the good side is we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| going to earn higher interest rates. Bad side is, is when we borrow, we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| pay higher interest rates. So, okay. The one thing that, again, is positive, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| more on the expenditure side, is lower fuel cost. Gasoline prices have come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| less than estimated, so we are saving on gasoline tax. Now, I'm not so sure we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| saving that much on diesel, because the gap between diesel and unleaded has, is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| is basically increased, and it's now more than what we would normally expect. So, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| we're probably not saving a whole lot on diesel. So, cap, which is primarily driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| by, you know, diesel, I'm not sure we're going to see that kind of thing, but, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| for the rest of us, we're probably going to see lower fuel cost. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| Sorry. Remind us, what was the forecast on real property, growth, growth in real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1804)|
| 0:30:16| property? Well, I think it was 1.38 percent, and it came in at 0.34. Okay. And it came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| in at what? 0.34. So, will you tell us what that translates into? We've got a slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| coming up on that. Okay. Okay. Wait for a second. Okay. Well, again, 1 percent, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1830)|
| 0:30:43| is not tax, let's see, probably a million bucks. What, what is a penny on the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| rate? Five hundred and three thousand eight hundred dollars. What's that? Okay. So, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1849)|
| 0:31:00| again, you think about that, that's roughly two cents on the tax rate. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| Here's our forecast for the end of the year, and we're going to, you know, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| we had last year, and again, this assumes hollow income tax come in exactly at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| budget at 4.9. I wish I could tell you what hollow income tax is going to do. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| can't, so it could be higher, could be lower. I think if hollow income tax comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| in at 4.9, we're going to be real close on these numbers. Our budget was 219| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| million. We're now forecasting that we're going to get about 221. Again, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| holding hollow income tax costs. We're saying that our expenditures were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| budgeted at two point, excluding the reserve, 225 million dollars. We think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| now that our expenditures are going to be roughly 227 million dollars. Now, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| includes some changes that we're going to have in a budget amendment that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| going to be bringing to you probably in the next, not next council meeting, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| probably the one after that. So, so again, revenues are going to be up about two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| million, expenditures are going to be up about two million. Now, by charter, the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| has to budget a reserve of no less than one percent, between one percent and five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| percent of the budget. Again, for last year, 2.3 million. We did not expect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| spend that, so, so again, that, that's just a number that we have to do to meet a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| charter requirement. Okay, if you take that, and again, had we spent the reserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1954)|
| 0:32:43| we would have, and every, again, everything came in exactly as budgeted, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| spend about eight million dollars in our fund balance. That would have dropped our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| fund, total fund balance from like 84, 84.8 to about 76.6 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| Okay, now, again, we don't expect to spend the reserve. So again, if these forecasts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1982)|
| 0:33:11| we're going to, we're going to spend about six million dollars more than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| we bring in, that should drop our fund balance from like 84.8 million to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| about 78.8 million. Okay, and I'm getting into numbers, you notice how it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2003)|
| 0:33:32| starts to quiet down when I start talking numbers instead of words, so, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| either I'm, you know, explaining it well, or you're just bored out of your mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| and it's probably the latter rather than... If you would sing as you're doing this, I think it would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| Well, if I were to sing, everybody would evacuate, and maybe that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| Okay, this is our general fund budgeted revenues. You can see property taxes, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| expected about a hundred and two million, almost a hundred and three million in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| property taxes. Now, that's all three categories. That's real personal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| public utility. Actually, you know, and just to give you some idea, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| estimated personal property actually came in higher than what we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| Public utility, we expected to drop about a half percent. It ended up dropping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| about four and a half percent. So, again, those numbers are all in flux. Okay, local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| sales tax, a little less than 42 million. KUB, around 20 million. KUB is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| going to come in higher than what we expected. Other taxes, and that includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| business taxes, cable franchise fees, budgeted a little around 24 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| State sales taxes, about 15 and a half million. All income tax, 4.9. Other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| other other intergovernmental is like 4.75 million. Okay, now all of these above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2094)|
| 0:35:04| this line are either what we call taxes or intergovernmental revenue. That's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| 97%. Those two categories constitute 97% of our revenue. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| everything else. Okay, about 5 million, you know, a little less than 5.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| million. So, again, we have to pay particular attention to everything above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| that line. And, again, the fund balance gets you back to that 8.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| million dollar use of fund balance. This just looks at it in terms of pie chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2131)|
| 0:35:40| See, property tax is about 45%. Local option, local sales tax, about 8%. KUB is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| around 9%. Other taxes, about 11. All income tax is about 2% of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| Jim, let's make the point. I know a lot of people won't be able to read these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| numbers, even maybe on your printouts, but all of this will be online after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| meeting so that you can see the numbers better on your screen. Okay, and I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2165)|
| 0:36:14| you to remember this number, the property tax at 45%. Okay, well, yeah, that includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2174)|
| 0:36:22| fund balance. Okay, if you take fund balance out, because fund balance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| really not a revenue, just what we talk about recurring revenues, property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| are now 47% of the revenues that you need to operate, keep your operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| going. Okay, just recurring, those are things that are probably recurring items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| and you got recurring expenditures, you know. So, I've taken fund balance out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| Again, property taxes represent 47% of the pie. Local sales tax, about 19%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| It doesn't change significantly, but it is a little higher. So, remember that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| 47% number. Okay, this chart I don't expect you to read, but this breaks it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2221)|
| 0:37:09| down. You can see that, you know, typically what happens is that, you know, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| have a tax rate increase, the percentage of the pie from property tax goes up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| then it typically steadily declines as a percentage of your pie, because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| property taxes, again, that biggest piece of the pie grows at a much slower rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| than everything else. Okay, and again, that's a, you know, one takeaway that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| wish you, I want you to know, is that property taxes, the biggest piece of your pie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| is not your fastest growing. If it were, that would solve a myriad of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| issues. Okay, again, this is real property values. You can see that this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2267)|
| 0:37:56| reappraisal year. City doesn't really gain from reappraisal, because you lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| the tax rate. So, that's what happens there. So, these are assessed values. These| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| are not, and this is real property, only does not include personal nor public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| utility. So, you can see, you know, we, our total, and this is all in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| thousands. So, our total assessed value is like 4.7 billion dollars. That's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| market value. Market value is a lot higher. Okay, there are three distinctions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| here. There's residential, blue, blue, just blue is residential, red is commercial, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| the other kind of tilly color is industrial. It's a very small percentage. Okay, City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| Knoxville, and again, I wish I had one of these slides for Knox County, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| it would be totally different, or at least outside the county. You could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| probably flip-flop the percentages here. If you took just outside Knox County, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| might probably even be less. Outside of Knox County, residential is a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| higher, and commercial is a whole lot lower. So, City of Knoxville is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| commercial hub of Knox County and the entire region. Outside of Knox County, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| mean outside the city, right? So, and again, the assessment ratios are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| different. So, for example, commercial is assessed at 40% of the value. Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| is assessed at 25% of the value. So, for example, if you had a $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| business and a $200,000 residential, the $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| residential is going to be assessed at 25% or 50,000. The $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| business, and that includes apartments, are going to be assessed at $80,000. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| they pay a higher percentage of taxes in residential. But again, what we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| in the city, again, is commercial, very disproportionate commercial, and outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2397)|
| 0:40:06| the city, you kind of flip-flop. I think there's a real important point in what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| Jim's putting up here that he did mention at once, and that is we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| gain from inflation in property. And that's why you might figure, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| gosh, my house was worth way more than it was in 18-19 than it was 10-11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| and the residential portion really hadn't moved that much. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| only way we can we can increase those dollars is through growth, and you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| see the success of the commercial growth there, you know, as well, and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| it's appraised. But the fact that property tax can't gain from inflation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| really, really puts a real strain on our budget, and budgets all over the state as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| well. Okay. This is our growth in property values, and again, you can see 10-11, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2449)|
| 0:40:59| was about 0.73, you know, one and a half percent. This is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| highest it got. It's always been less than two, but it was close to two here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| you know, drops down here, low ones, low ones, low ones, jumped up a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| here, now dropped way below one. So again, this is growth. This is growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| So it kind of stacks on top of one another, right? Yes. It's not that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| property values went down from 1.46 to 0.34, it's just it didn't go up as fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| as the year before, as much as the year before. Jim, is this all property or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| residential, commercial? This is real, this is residential, commercial, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| industrial. Now again, this is real property only, does not include personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| property, does not include public utility property. But real property, just trust me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| real property, if you took all three of them, real property is probably 90 some odd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| percent of the total property value pie. Jim, did you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2521)|
| 0:42:09| theories on why it didn't meet expectations? Well, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| several reasons. One, okay, is all property tax, when we go back and we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2535)|
| 0:42:24| 4.7 billion, that's a pretty large base. You know, the way percentages work is, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2544)|
| 0:42:33| know, the bigger the base, you could have the same amount of growth, but as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| percentage, you know, for example, I'll use New York City and, let's see, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| think of a small city, Oak Ridge. Okay, 1% growth in population in New York City is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| probably worth more than, you know, 100% growth in Oak Ridge, and I made it, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2571)|
| 0:42:59| know, and that's just because the way percentage works. And so the bigger your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| base is, you know, in order to move at the same lot of percentage, you got to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| to grow a little bit more. Then there's some other things that happen. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| some things that come off their tax base. So, for example, again, let's talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| pilots. Just those come off the tax roll, so that can tamper the growth every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| time you do a pilot. Now, you're still going to get the taxes, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| going to be in a different form than real, you know, in property tax. You're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| going to get it in form of the payment and move taxes, but that does kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| distort. And then the other thing is, is maybe, you know, growth is just not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| much as what we expect, but again, it's a combination of kind of all three of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| things. So, okay, local option sales tax. Again, you can see we're forecasting now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2624)|
| 0:43:56| at about 42.3 million dollars. Again, that's higher than what we budgeted, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| by much, but still higher. But, you can see, I'm a little concerned because for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| the last three years, it's been kind of flat. This year, this jump is attributable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| to a couple of things. One is, you know, we're just coming kind of out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| recession. We got a bump from Amazon, but then it's kind of flatlined. This one, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| a little bit surprised that we haven't had that kind of growth this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| because I'm expecting that to kind of stay in a fairly narrow band, too. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| when you think of what happens, people are going, buying more and more online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| Now, Amazon is an exception because we do capture a portion of that sales tax, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| most online sales, the city and neither the city nor the state capture a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| whole lot of online sales, because you have to have a physical presence inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| the state to get and collect any sales tax on online sales. So, for example, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| you're doing something, a business in New York or Chicago, and they don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| physical presence here in the state, neither the state nor the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| are going to get any sales tax. Trust me, more people are going online, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| going to affect your sales tax growth going forward, unless there's a change in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| state where the state passes a law that allows us to capture out-of-state sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| Okay, so that's an important consideration. Okay, this is Hall income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| tax. It's all over the place. Okay, seriously, I could throw a dart and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2734)|
| 0:45:47| just as accurate in forecasting as when, again, but when you think of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| forward, it's going to be pretty easy, you know, it'd be pretty easy to forecast. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| this is the change, and this is a percentage change, and again, this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| pretty big number. So, you can drop 34% one year, go up 88%, go up 27%, go up 127%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2762)|
| 0:46:12| I think, well, let's see, this year, statewide was about 15%. We went up 219%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2772)|
| 0:46:23| Knox County was about 15%, you know, so that's everything outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| Jim, could you go back a slide? And so, the last few years, it's been, well, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2789)|
| 0:46:37| since 12-13, and you budget typically between 4 and 5 million? I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| typically budgeted about 5 million dollars, because honestly, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| likely, and next year, I'm not sure that I'm going to budget 5 million next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| because the rate's actually going down from 3% to 2%. Right, so for the last six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| years, it's been a huge pad on the budget. If you budget 5, and it comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| you know, between 12 and 8.4. And remember last year, I said how much of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| that affected fund balance? Okay, had we not captured that, our fund balance for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| multiple years, our fund balance would be, again, a lot lower. Right. Those forecasts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| with the exception of Hall income tax are pretty close. Might change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| slide to Hall income revenue. Okay. Well, in two years, it won't matter, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2838)|
| 0:47:27| not going to be here anyway, so. Okay, this is our expenditure chart. This is by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2847)|
| 0:47:37| function. This is what you think it's going to be. Again, public safety is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| 42%, parks and recs about 4%, public service about 11%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| engineering is 3%. Some other things. Non-departmental, and I'm going to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| about non-departmental. Non-departmental is mostly the unamortized portion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| pension system. Transfers and general governments, basically, you have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| categories that kind of lump a bunch of things together, but the big ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| is you would expect is public service. Again, non-departmental is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| pretty big, and transfers are pretty big. We talked a lot about transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| I'll show you some transfers here going forward. This is by type, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2899)|
| 0:48:28| includes transfers, and I've got another slide, so I'm not going to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| much. If you include transfers, the total cost of pension, healthcare, and salary is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2911)|
| 0:48:41| around 44%. Okay, what you would expect. Non-governmental, again, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2921)|
| 0:48:50| includes the unamortized pension, and again, I've got some another slide here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| going forward. Transfer is about 18%. So, but you've got fleet, you got risk, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2935)|
| 0:49:03| got utilities grants. The biggest chunk is still salaries. Okay, you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| transfers out, which is probably a better number. The percentage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| what we spend excluding transfers is around 68% of our budget is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| gone, and I put the unamortized portion here to give you some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| notion. It's about 68% of our total revenues, our total expenditures are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| spent on salaries. Again, not unexpected. We are a service-driven organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| Most service-driven organizations have a higher, much higher percentage of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| expenditures going to salaries. Okay, what's important, and remember we talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| about that other pie, is 47% biggest share of your revenues. It's growing by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=2994)|
| 0:50:03| again, maybe a little over 1% per year. This is 70% of your expenditures, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| it's growing by probably four and a half percent. To me, this is the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| significant. The biggest piece of your pie is growing at a lot lower rate than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| what your expense, the biggest portion of your expenditures are. That's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| hard, hard thing. We talk now recurring revenue, recurring expenses. Your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| recurring expenses, at least the biggest portion of them, are growing at a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| faster rate than the biggest share of your recurring revenues. And again, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3039)|
| 0:50:49| one's kind of an aberration, and that's just because we took some things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| There's some footnotes here. Last year, our salaries and benefits grew by 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| That's probably, again, slightly aberrational. That's very similar to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| happened here. It's when we had changed an assumption on the pension discount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| rate. When we dropped it from like eight to seven and three-eighths, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| skyrocketed, and those are significant numbers. We changed it from seven and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| quarter to seven and an eighth. Okay, our total amortization on the pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| last year, just as a few other factors, but primarily driven by a one-eighth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| change in the discount rate, was roughly three million dollars. Okay, so small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3097)|
| 0:51:47| changes and some numbers, you know, have significant impacts. If you were to drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3107)|
| 0:51:54| that another, you know, another eighth of a point, probably goes up three million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| dollars. People talk about the market. I'm pinching to say, well, okay, market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| performance is one thing. The biggest factor in a lot of these things is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| are you assuming as your discount rate? Because you're assuming that over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| next 80 years, probably. That has a huge impact on what you do. People| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| look at those market performances, and I do too, but again, that's probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| least, you know, not the least, but far less significant of what kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| assumptions you're making. And I think it's worth pointing out, in doing that, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| taking risk off the city for the future. We were, the city's gotten so much trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| and we got so far behind. We were assuming over eight percent growth every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| year in the market. Well, that's great until it doesn't happen, and then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| exposed. We're, as Jim pointed out, we're assuming a lower and lower growth rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| We're paying more now by being more conservative in that assumption, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| we're really buffering the city in the future against another market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| downturn where we'd assumed being way up here, and it came in way down here. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| assumptions are, I think, are much more responsible. And the new plan, the newest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| plan, is actually at a lower discount rate. The newer plan is at a five and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| half percent discount rate, okay, but if you look at what we call the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| contribution, the normal contribution would be what it is if it were fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| funded. Actually, the percentages of a payroll are roughly the same, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| between the old plan. Now, the only reason they're the same is because the old one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| uses a seven and eighth and the new one uses a five and a half. If they, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| were using a five and a half, I guarantee you that on the old plans, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| skyrocket. It would be a heck of a lot more than, you know, these 17, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| probably around 10% and 17%, depending on which, whether uniformed or general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| government. If we went to probably five and a half, I'm sure those would more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| than double. We'd be talking 34, 35, 40% of payroll for a normal cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| contribution and probably, you know, 20, 25 on general government. So again, big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| big changes there, again. But the important thing is, again, probably if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| were to forecast where we're going to be next year, salaries are going to go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| about somewhere between three and a half and four percent. Forecast property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| it's going to go up about one, one percent, maybe a little higher, maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| little lower. But again, so you're looking at, this is this, this is what we call a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| structural problem in terms of revenue. When one piece just grows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| exponentially faster than another piece, okay? Okay, I get the sense I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3284)|
| 0:54:54| about to get the hook, so I better step it up. Okay, non-departmental, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| transfers. Again, it's just so forth. If you take our total transfers and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3300)|
| 0:55:09| contribution to the pension, what we consider, we consider that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| non-departmental expense, this breaks those up. You can see where the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| pieces of the pie, you got solid waste, capital projects, mass transit, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| amortization of the unfunded liability on the pension. Give you some, how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| that is in terms of dollars, this is going to be up next year about six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3330)|
| 0:55:37| hundred and thirteen thousand. I'll talk a little bit more about that, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| close to, it's around twenty million dollars. You're going to talk about why it's up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| I'll talk, well I can. Okay, and again, this is just raw numbers. You can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| the unfunded liability is 19-4. Next year, and again, you'll see it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3352)|
| 0:56:00| it's one of the things that are going to drive it, it's going to go up six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| hundred and thirteen thousand. I don't, it's one of the few numbers that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| actually know what it's going to be next year. We're still in the process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| forecasting, we've already forecasted that. It's going to be, again, up six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| hundred thirteen thousand, so it'll be twenty million four hundred seventeen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| thousand dollars. Okay, this is our estimated pension total, this is total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| this is not, this is not, this is unfunded amortization and normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| contributions. You can see it's still headed up, it's going to go up, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| depending on market performance, depending on what assumption rates you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| use, and so forth. And you can see for the next 19 years, it's going to keep going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| up, then it's going to drop here, and we're assuming we're going to hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| hundred percent funding out here, you know, and then it's going to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| grow just as a function of salary, you know, normal salary increases and a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| other things. But again, it's a long ways off before we see that taper off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| Do you want to talk, Jim, what we did with that unfunded portion several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| ago, basically treating it like every year we're going to make a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| and pay that down over a long window? There are two ways to treat the unfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| liability. You can treat it as a percentage of payroll, or you can treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| it like we are now, and that's what we used to do, is treat it as a percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| of payroll, and it just adds on. Your normal contribution is what it is if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| it's a hundred percent funded, and that's always expressed as a percentage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| payroll. So, for example, on uniformed it's a little around 17 percent, so for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| normal contribution, and it's about eight to ten percent, depending on which plane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| you're in, for general government. Okay, now if you take that unfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| amortization and you treat that as a percentage of payroll, that will drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| your percentage of payroll up into, in the case of uniforms, probably to over 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| percent of salaries. General government probably up around 20 percent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| salaries. Now the odd thing is, is because we have a closed plan, meaning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| there are no more people entering that plan, what happens is your base as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| percentage of payroll goes down, your percentage of payroll goes way up. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| what we did a couple of years ago, we decided that we're going to treat the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| amortization of that unfunded liability as kind of a fixed cost, you know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| we're going to express it as a fixed percentage, and we do that calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| internally. We work with the actuaries to do that, and again, that's what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| talking. The amortization of that unfunded liability is, if you just take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| these numbers, two-thirds of that total pension cost is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| amortization of the unfunded liability. So roughly 20 million, or maybe another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| 10, which would be your normal contribution. Okay, and again, once it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| fully amortized, then it drops off, you know, that's why you have that big cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3548)|
| 0:59:16| Okay, anything else? Yeah, Jim, what is our total pension liability right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| Our total pension liability, I'm going to give you two numbers. One's out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| CAFR, there's a lag between the CAFR. Our total pension liability in the CAFR is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| 204 million. Our total pension liability in the next CAFR is going to be around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3574)|
| 0:59:41| that's net pension liability, is going to be roughly a little bit over 210| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| million dollars. That's the unfunded? That's the unfunded portion that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| amortizing, and again, that's going to be done over the next 19 years. So Jim, going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3591)|
| 0:59:59| back to your pie charts on expenses, so the pension at 4% and 5%, does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3599)|
| 1:00:07| include the unfunded portion? That does include the unfunded portion. It does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| Yes. It assumes the growth in the unfunded. Oh, I meant the pie chart on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| expenses. This one? No, that one. This one does. So that? This one does not. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3619)|
| 1:00:34| unfunded is in this piece. Is there something else in that non-departmental? Yeah, there's another piece in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3634)|
| 1:00:44| non-departmental. It's pretty small. It's basically what we pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| retiree health care coverage, but trust me, the total thing was about 20 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3647)|
| 1:00:56| dollars and about 19.6 million, you know, is unfunded. So this excludes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| transfers? This excludes transfers, but it does include the non-departmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| because those are true recurring costs. Okay. You know, and really, in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3667)|
| 1:01:15| look back, if we did this like over 10 years, this would be a truer comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| because again, pension used to be included in just plain old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| salaries. Right. I guess I'm just looking at that in relation to the 40% versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| 5%. It seems... Well, unfortunately, whether you like it or not, again, I told you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| next year, the amortization of the pension liability is going to go up 613,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| That's part of that 4 to 5%. Last year, it was greater just because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| took that one-year hit because of the change in the discount rate. So that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| of flatlines, but I still expect the amortization to go up going forward. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| if we start shrinking out 10 to 12 percent returns annually, yeah, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| that'll change it, but I don't expect that to happen. I'd be more concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| about coming up with 6 and 7, you know, 5 and 6 percent returns rather than 10 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| 12, but you still look a little, you know, puzzled. I'm just amazed at how quiet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3737)|
| 1:02:29| it's gotten. So, I mean, I know that people are sleeping out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| How is our debt service represented in these charts? Okay, our debt service is really not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3754)|
| 1:02:47| represented in any of these charts because this is a general fund. The debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| service piece, at least the payment comes from two sources, comes from our debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| service fund. I can talk about debt service and I'll be happy to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| debt service, but it's not included in here. Okay, there is one, again, one slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3780)|
| 1:03:09| when we talk about the future. I'm going to definitely talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| debt service because it's significant, but if you have any questions about debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| service, I'll be happy to talk about them right now. So, okay, I got to my slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| anyway. So, things that are going to affect us going into 1920. Higher pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3802)|
| 1:03:31| costs, as I just mentioned, 613,000. I already know what the amortization piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| is. Okay, salaries, cost of living, we talked about, again, that's part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| four and a half, you know, three and a half to four percent. Elections cost, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| that fluctuates every other year. This year it was budgeted at ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| thousand dollars. That's just kind of a buffer in case we did have something on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| the election. Next year it's probably going to be three hundred and twenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| thousand in that range. So, we're going to take, as we do next year's budget, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| got to prepare for another three hundred and twenty thousand dollar expense in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| just in elections. Okay, we've already talked about limited new growth in real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| property, potential federal cuts. I have no idea, you know, feds are, I feel more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| likely it's on the downside than the upside, but here. I want to talk here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| about a possible recession, lower growth in local option sales tax. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3867)|
| 1:04:35| there was an article in, I think, about a week ago in the paper where it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| Knoxville is a recession-proof city. That's a misnomer. We are not, trust me, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| are not recession-proof. We are maybe a little more recession-resistant, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| are definitely not recession-proof. Most economists are forecasting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3891)|
| 1:04:59| recession, the tail end of this calendar year, first quarter of next calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| So, when you think about that, what are the things that are, property taxes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| typically not affected by, at least on the near term, are not affected by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| recession. But local option sales taxes, state shared sales taxes, big ticket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| numbers, those are affected by a recession. And, like I said, don't pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| any attention to the thing that says we're recession-proof because we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| Now, we're still better off than most places, but if the country gets sick, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| get sick, too. Now, ours just may be a milder variant of the sickness, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| get sick as well, okay? The other thing is cost of new debt. If you recall, last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3943)|
| 1:05:52| when we did this budget, we said we were going to issue 54.2 million dollars, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| think, but we did not expect that we were going to borrow it at that time, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| did not budget for the expected cost of that new debt. Now, next year, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3965)|
| 1:06:13| expecting that we're going to go to market. I still don't know when we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| going to go to market, but we're going to go to market. Right now, if you were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| ask me, the cost of servicing that debt, or basically paying off that debt, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| going to go up, going to be somewhere around four million dollars a year, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| Now, that's four million dollars that we are taking out of a stream that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| used to pay pay-as-you-go capital, and now you're going to service debt, service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| on that, so you basically just lost what you're doing in pay-as-you-go capital by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| four million dollars. That's it, and again, that's assuming we only borrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| 50, 52 million, so that gives you some, you know, idea. Four, you know, four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4011)|
| 1:06:59| million dollars to just pay. That's basically what your principal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| interest payment is going to be, you know, pretty big principal and interest payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| okay? So, will we be retiring any debt? I mean, is there any debt that we're paying off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| We retire debt at least a portion each year, because we're like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| everything else. We've got more than one issue, so we do pay down, you know, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| portion here, but our payments, you know, it's like anything else, you know, you pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| off a car payment, you're paying down some of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| principal, so we do have that reduction. The first time that we're actually going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| to see that total payment go away is like 2021, so it does stair-step down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| and there's another stair-step down to about 2027, but, you know, really, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4062)|
| 1:07:51| we're going to try and do some, when we do this issuance, we're going to do some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| kind of do probably something what we call a wrap-around piece of debt, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| we're going to try and minimize what our initial costs up front, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| something that, you know, I feel like a used car salesman when I'm talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| about that. It's like, what do you want your car payment to be? You know, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| finance anything, so, but, you know, so we're going to try and structure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| debt so that it hits us a little less in those front years, but what that does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| again, just so you know, we pay less principal in those front years. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| means overall, over the life of that debt, we will pay more in interest costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| because we're paying higher principal out in the out years, so, but we'll, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| kind of do, do some, some kind of financing, but what that does is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| takes all those stair-steps out in those out years, so, you know, just understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| that is there is no, no magic kind of thing that we can do. I mean, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| to have, we're going to have about four million in cost. We'll try and minimize those in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| in the, in the, in the front-loaded years, but again, it costs us more over the life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| of that. Again, it's still a responsible financial, you know, plan, but, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| everything that we do has trade-offs, and that's what we have to do. We trade off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| lower principal payments in the front, pay, cost us longer, longer to retire that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| you back in load a little bit more, your interest cost over the life of that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| way up, so, okay. Like I said, I've, crowd's quiet, so this basically, I doubt that. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4164)|
| 1:09:37| know better than that. So, Jim, very quickly, I know we talked, we talked. She's uplifted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4177)|
| 1:09:48| after a night, you know, by this speech, so. I'm really excited. I think the, the pigeon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| slide where it drops off in 19 years, you know, we proactively knew we had an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| we weren't going to hide from it. We developed a system to pay that unfunded portion off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| over 20 years, Jim. I mean, that was, we knew that was there. We wanted to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| it, pull it out separately versus a percentage of payroll and salaries. So, we tackled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4209)|
| 1:10:16| We laid it out there and set up a plan to tackle that unfunded portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| Well, we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| And we put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| And we put money down on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Well, we did several things. What he just mentioned, we also, we took $10 million from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| the fund balance, applied it towards that. And we also had pension reform. So, we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| we knew when we came in that we had a pension system that had been sweetened considerably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| over the years, such to where it was not sustainable. We still believe in the pension system and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| we tackle the members of city council who have been on for as long as I have. We worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| together with the employee groups and came up with a reform plan. And that's the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| plan that all new employees come into starting, I think, January 13th. Is that right? Somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4259)|
| 1:11:07| So, there are three ways that we have tackled this. And so, I feel pretty comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| where we are with it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| I think another really important takeaway is investment and growth is where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| more revenue within the system. We know property tax growth starts to diminish several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| after the tax increase, Jim. And so, we need investment and growth. That's incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| So, Jim, remind me, the $54 million that we've obligated ourselves for but we haven't taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4295)|
| 1:11:46| the debt for, that was like the urban wilderness was $10 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| $10 million. Roughly $40 million for the public safety complex or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4311)|
| 1:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| That was a portion for Pacific Auditorium Coliseum. And then there was, I think, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4320)|
| 1:12:09| other little smaller piece that we had. But those are the three big items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| And you don't see that happening between now and the end of June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| I do not see that. I do not see us borrowing between now and the end of June. But if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| ask me for the calendar year, then that may change the dynamics a lot. But at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| once you borrow, you're going to start paying down the principal and interest. Now, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| this is probably a good thing because you don't borrow before you have to because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| start paying interest from the day you borrow. I'm a believer you don't want to pay any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| interest than you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| So that $4 million a year in additional expense, plus you're decreasing income with the haul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4370)|
| 1:13:01| and haul income tax going away, projecting out. So based on that, based on the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| increases and decreases that you got, how long can you sustain this balance without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| a tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| That feels like kind of a loaded question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| Well, I can tell you at least another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| I understand that. But we're going to live here longer than another year. So what do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| you think? I mean, we're coming at that. You're coming at it. I mean, it's coming to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4410)|
| 1:13:37| Just like it came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| Absolutely. No, I'm not critical. I'm not critical. I'm just saying we got to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| about that. This next council's got to think about that. And I'm not making critical. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| just saying, I mean, it's coming at you. You're going up in expenses. You've got to be thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| about that. And you've got to be planning for it. I just wonder what your projection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| is. You're just like, well, I think we can get by. I think you've got to be thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| And I think part of it is you have to make choices as you go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| And we tackled that when we came in, those of us, four members of council and this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4448)|
| 1:14:15| We had the unfunded pension. We came in right as we were digging out from under the recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4455)|
| 1:14:22| We had unfunded pension liability. We actually looked at the first two years we tackled the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4462)|
| 1:14:31| pension, basically. And I think it was the third year when actually we had a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| And what we did is we looked at, I had two different budgets submitted by our departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| One was, if we didn't have a tax increase, what would, and you had a 7% reduction if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| I recall right, they had to come up with a budget with a 7% reduction. And what did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| look like? What would we cut out? What would we no longer do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| And then if you had a full budget, if you really looked at what you would normally ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| for, what would that look like? And we analyzed that. And we made the decision that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| cut back and you wouldn't have the kind of investments that you've seen. We would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| basically paying the most basic bills, but we wouldn't make the investments, which then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| helps to grow the economy, create jobs. The investments, when you look around Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| over these last, you know, seven years, the kinds of investments that we've seen. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| so we laid that out at, you'll remember at the, at the, at the state of the city, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| budget luncheon and talked about our two choices. And what we proposed was the investment mentality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| You know, we raised the taxes and this is what we can accomplish with it. And so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| the next mayor, you know, two years from now, three years from now or whatever, we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| to decide in this, on the council that remains, what, what choice do you want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| do you want to kind of stop where you are, pay the basic bills, provide the basic services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| or are there opportunities that you want to be able to invest in and therefore you, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| make a, you know, the mayor make a proposal to raise taxes in order to do that. But we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| you know, we, I remember the day we presented that budget luncheon, we had a standing ovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| at the end from the 800 or so people who were there because we laid out a vision for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| what we hope to accomplish with that. This is the reason why we are making this choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| You know, we could just pay pension and pay basic, do basic services, basic public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| or we could do all the things that you have seen that are happening around us. So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| council, the five of you who remain after next December, you and the new mayor and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| new four, the other new council members, will come to a point where you have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| that choice as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| So, Jim, what do you think? I mean, is this, I mean, I get all that. I've lived all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| I know you do. I wanted to make sure that others understood that who are newer to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| But you've got income that's going away and you've got income that's going down, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| got expenses that are going up, and based on where you are and what services we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| to provide, I mean, what do you see that? I mean, do you think that we can get through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| you know, two years or three years? Is that, is that going to come out to a point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| I'm going to answer that. They're going to be, you've got to ask yourself a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4638)|
| 1:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| So a lot of the time...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| One is, is what do you want to spend on capital? What do you want to spend on recurring services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| How willing are you to have your bond rate downgraded? You know, how much are you willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4655)|
| 1:17:43| to... Those are some tough questions. Now, and your answers to those questions, quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| honestly, are going to depend on, you know, wind and weather. You know, so if the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4670)|
| 1:17:58| are you want to keep going at a certain rate, you want to borrow more money, you know, that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4678)|
| 1:18:06| if you look at the whole scheme of things, you know, and you're not willing to lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| capital, you're not willing to lower services, it comes a lot sooner than later. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| that's just the way the math's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| And so there's no direct answer, I mean, there's no actual answer, but it's, it's variable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| right? Based on those kind of questions that are made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| But I mean, it, I mean, you're right. It's, those, the factors that are coming are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| It's just a question of when, unless you change, change certain things. I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| Jim, what is our rate now compared to what it has been for property tax? Because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4719)|
| 1:18:46| rate goes down when we have reappraisal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| The rate is, the actual rate is a lot less than what it used to be. I can remember when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| it was well over three, three bucks per hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| I think that gets to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| But it's about 2.42 now, 2.4238.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| Tax increases are structured, really, in city government. I mean, you can't really get around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| that. I mean, the federal government, when inflation, everybody makes more money, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| taxes automatically go up. The biggest portion we have is property. And any time the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| goes up, the rate is set down. So the, you know, that means for the biggest portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| with our expenses going up, if the taxes aren't, if that rate isn't adjusted periodically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| we're always going to fall behind much more than the, that's why the state can go on for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| a lot longer with the same sale. I don't know how long it's been since they've had a sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| tax increase, but all of that increase in what things cost has caused state revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| to go up. And I think that's just a sad, you know, reality of where we are in local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| We don't benefit from inflation in the taxes we get in for the biggest portion. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| means the only way that gets adjusted is the, is that, it would be the equivalent as every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| time you bought something that costs more money, the state had to then adjust the sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| tax rate down, which it doesn't do. So I think that's just, just something that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| keep in mind that, and David pointed out a little bit ago, on property tax, if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| get new investment or new redevelopment, that is just going to be flat, period. It'd have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| to be adjusted manually by votes every few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| Totally neutral slide. This is just our budget calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4830)|
| 1:20:38| But I'll answer questions. I'll answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| This is just a quick question. This came up last year, and I'm wondering if you can just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| remind us the city's, how the city invests in all public schools and how that's structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4844)|
| 1:20:51| how much funding goes to not just public schools, but local options sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| Okay, let's talk local options sales tax. The local options sales tax is two and a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4857)|
| 1:21:05| percent. The city, and we're going to divide that down, out of that two and a quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| 1.625 cents goes to Knox County Schools, .625 comes to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| Outside, and sales taxes, local options sales taxes are what we call CITUS based. And CITUS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| based means it's based on the point of sale. So if the sale occurs inside the city, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| city gets that money. If it's in unincorporated Knox County, Knox County gets that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| If it's in Farragut, Farragut gets that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| Okay, for unincorporated Knox County, that same split holds. Out of the two and a quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| it's 1.625 to Knox County Schools, .625 to Knox County. In Farragut, the split is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4905)|
| 1:21:54| It's 50-50. So that's what, 1.125 cents goes to Farragut, 1.125 cents goes to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4914)|
| 1:22:06| Okay, now that's the split. Remember I told you that the city is the commercial hub. It is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4926)|
| 1:22:15| the retail hub. And that 1.625% is roughly 72%. Okay, now this number is going to sound odd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4935)|
| 1:22:25| but roughly, because it's not just coincidence, 72% of the entire taxes inside Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4945)|
| 1:22:36| that includes Farragut, unincorporated Knox County, and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| Take everything combined, and roughly 70, it varies a little bit, but it's over 70%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| and it typically averages around 72% too. That's just, again, coincident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| About 72% of the total sales taxes collected in the entire county are collected inside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4972)|
| 1:23:02| Okay, now translating that to the school, and again, I'm not, I don't even pretend to be an expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| in the school budget. Sometimes I don't even pretend to be an expert in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| But the largest source of revenue to the schools is probably the BEP. That's done by a certain formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=4993)|
| 1:23:24| The second largest source to Knox County Schools is the local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5004)|
| 1:23:34| The third is property tax. Okay, now, so let's translate those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5014)|
| 1:23:41| Knox County property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| Knox County property taxes. City of Knoxville, city of Knoxville, everybody in the city pays Knox County property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5024)|
| 1:23:54| Roughly, this is rough, roughly 40% of the total property taxes for Knox County as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5034)|
| 1:24:02| come from inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| Roughly 40% of the total property taxes collected inside Knox County come from inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5046)|
| 1:24:14| Okay, that's the third largest source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| The second largest source, roughly 72% of the second largest source comes from inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5059)|
| 1:24:28| So, BEP, again, I don't understand the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| There's a workshop this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| No, I'm not planning on going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| He has budget things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| I think he's going to send Boy 7s, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| But the BEP is also affected by Knox County students inside the city limits and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| Disproportionate, and again, you add up all those factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| a much larger percentage of the total of Knox County Schools budget is generated inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5101)|
| 1:25:10| Okay, I think you probably said that, but to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| So the 1.625% of the local option sales tax generated within the city goes to the state and becomes part of the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5114)|
| 1:25:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| It's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| It goes directly to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| Now, you could take the same logic of the state sales taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5131)|
| 1:25:39| which does prepare, you know, come back to the schools, because that's the state sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| Again, if you take Knox County as a whole, 72% of that's going to come from inside the city limits, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5146)|
| 1:25:54| Jim, on your slide that shows our projected local option sales tax, that is just the amount that we will get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5154)|
| 1:26:04| That is just the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| It is not the amount that, a portion of that does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| He's already accounted for the fact that 72% goes already to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| That's $42 million, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| I want to say, and again, I'll do the math for you later, but I think I'm going to be close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| That's going to translate into roughly $110 million going into Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| And again, that number is pretty close, but again, I'll give you the exact math later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| And by the way, by law, the municipality does only have to pay what percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| 50%, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| So we have this, I think by, was it referendum, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| There have been three referendums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| The first referendum was for a one cent tax on 1% sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5213)|
| 1:27:01| When that referendum was passed, and that was passed a long, long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| 100% of that first 1% of that 2.25 goes to Knox County schools, or goes to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5228)|
| 1:27:17| And that was actually passed when there was a separate city school system as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| So the second one was a half, let's see, half cent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5242)|
| 1:27:30| I put it from one and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| I think I've got these right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| And then the third one was a three quarter of a cent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| And I may have those two flip-flopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| And those are split 50-50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| And you do, again, do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| That's where you get the 72%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| In Fall Park, what years did those happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| Well, the last one was in 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| So it hasn't changed since 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| It has not changed since 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| The time before that, I want to say, is sometime in the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| and I think the first one was in the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| And when did we go out of the school business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Maybe the late 50s, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| When did the city go out of the school business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| 86, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| I think it was 86.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| Before that last referral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| So, Jim, the growth rate of salaries and benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| how many employees do we have now that we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| what's our total number of employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| Our total number is roughly a little less than 1,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| I think it's 1,544, but I can look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| Is that increased over, I mean, is that part of the reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| It's increased slightly, but not, you know, maybe by one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| By one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| So you still have some unfunded police and fire positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| We always, just bear in mind, we always have turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| So at any one point in time, we are always going to have vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| But at one time we had, we were funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| I think it's four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| We fund the approved number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| 416 or 416.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| That's what it's funded at, even though we don't have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| Even though we don't have 416.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| Or 324.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| So we're okay in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| One of the key changes on the pension was the 10-year bested up from five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| Has that, have you seen that make a difference in terms of the salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| and benefits and, you know, the growth rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| Has that had a significant impact or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| You know, again, and I have not studied this in depth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| my guess is in the uniforms positions, it probably has some impact on recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5384)|
| 1:29:53| Probably more so on police than fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| I forget that I said that, Chief, but I think that's the way it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| So I think that it's probably had some impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| How much of an impact, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| I think what you are seeing, and this doesn't have to do with pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| again, it's the change in, again, I keep harping back to millennials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| the expectation, I think, of millennials is they're not going to be here for 30 years, 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5416)|
| 1:30:23| I think most of the millennials, the expectation is they're going to change jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5423)|
| 1:30:30| you know, more frequently than a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| The model of people coming to work for one place and working for their life has kind of changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| It's been changing for a long time, and it's not just, it's just now getting with millennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| So I think if you're looking at, obviously, from a personnel standpoint and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| we've got to be in tune with how that thing is going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| and how we structure our salaries, benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| and everything structure is going to have to be geared towards that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| because, again, I think that's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| And so, again, how we do that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| Again, that's going to be for people that follow me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| but I think we've started to see some of that, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| So hopefully that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Yeah, that's good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| Oh, calendar. Yeah, the calendar there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| And one other just note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| Dr. Lyons and Mayor Harrell will talk about this later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| but, you know, one important aspect of RECODE is the ability to invest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| especially along our corridors and higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| So when we look at revenue and growth, that is an important tool in how we grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| and the ease of growth in areas that we want that type of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| So that's an important factor, too, moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| Okay. Calendar. Again, a couple of important dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Obviously, February 8th, that's today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| We've had our budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| Y'all are free on February 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| except we will be back here for the legislative breakfast, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| A week from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| You're not planning another RECODE the night before, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| The mayor will be holding her budget hearings February 25th through the 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| and there's one day in there where there's none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| I think it's the 25th, the 26th, and the 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| and I think the 27th doesn't have anything scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| April 26th is when the mayor will do her State of the City presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| May 7th is our first reading of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| MPC has a hearing on capital improvement on May 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| Council budget hearings right now are scheduled for the 16th of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| Public hearing is scheduled for the 16th of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| There's a tentative date of the 17th for council budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| but I think the expectation is that will not be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| Second reading is May 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| That's when it's scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| The last day, the last possible day to approve the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| and the tax ordinance is June 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| And, again, just a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| if nothing is passed by council before midnight on June 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| then whatever the mayor's proposal is goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| So this is not like one of those, you know, we don't shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5613)|
| 1:33:39| We don't adopt a continuing resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| You have a deadline, and it requires some action on your part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| and if you don't action, something else happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| And then, obviously, July 1st is when the next fiscal year begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| Jim, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| You did a fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| And this is, as you said, this is your last budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| It is my last budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| and for four council members it is their last budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| So, Jim, would you please introduce your finance team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| and have them stand up so we can recognize they're all working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| Voices in the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| Some of them I can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| So Robin Shelton's back in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| Cheryl Davis is in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| Miranda Brock's in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| Pam Coughlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| Everybody in finance sits in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| Close to the door, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| Well, again, one of the rules, voice-violated rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| we always like to have our back to the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| Pamela Coughlin's back there somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| and Penny Owens is back there somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| but is there anybody I missed that I can't see back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| If there is somebody, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| Well, we want to thank all of the finance team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| because they are really crunching numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| and working with all the departments to, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| get all the requests to do the anticipated revenues, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| We have to, Jim and some of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| have to figure out what we can expect for the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| and then we work to put together all the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| and the requests that then will be presented to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| and then we work to put it together to present to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| So a lot of work's going on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| between now and April 26th when you will see our proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| So thanks very much to the whole team there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| So we've been here an hour and a half about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| so let's take a 10-minute break and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| We have lunch at 1130, so when we come back in 10 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| then we will get into the next phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| which is reviewing some programs and services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| and then that will leave us up to lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Okay, so next and final item on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| is to share some of the programs and projects and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| that we provide as a city to people, to our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| And our theme is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Investing in an Inclusive, Thriving, and Sustainable City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| It's basically kind of an overlay of the stuff that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| is to think about how to help Knoxville thrive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| how to make sure that we're ever-growing in inclusiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| and that we are sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| and looking to the future and making preparations now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| that will affect future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| make sure that how it affects future generations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| will be in a positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| So we go to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| Who's leading this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Oh, you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| So apparently I'm going to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| So, you know, I think from the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| of my administration, we put out that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| what makes a great city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| and have throughout each budget year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| talked about how we are continuing to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| on making Knoxville a greater city than it already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| And so we've broken down for the purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| of this presentation three main areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| And I have to say that what we cover today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| there are a lot of things that we are not covering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| And if you just look at all the folks in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| the work that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| it's impossible to present over the next hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| So we picked some of the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| that we particularly wanted to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| but know that there's a lot that is not being mentioned today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| But we want to focus first on our quality core services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| which of course is public safety, our police and fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| and then our public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| We want to talk about some of the ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| that we invest in people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| both in our focus on neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| on affordable housing, health, accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| youth, and social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| And then we want to talk about the big ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| that create prosperity, opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| and a higher quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| These are the economic development projects that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| some of the major infrastructure improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| and the ways that often this helps us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| many of these projects leverage the private investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| which is what really helps us to grow the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| create more jobs, and create a higher quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| for folks who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| So I'm going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| Bill and David are going to do most of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| but I will pop in, as you know I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| when I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| that there's additional information to give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| So, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Yep, thank you very much, Mayor and members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| And of course, remember, all of our department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| our chiefs, our senior staff are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| to answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Yeah, thank you very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| members of City Council and the Cabinet and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| So core services, I think I've been through 16 of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| over my career, budget retreats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| and core services are oftentimes at the foundation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| And so health and safety of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| sanitation, police, fire, and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| are the bedrock of what we do on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| And so, again, we've got a slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| really for each of these functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| Later in the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| we'll talk about very specific projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| We could have a 30- or 40-slide presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| just on police, just on fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| but we've got one highlight slide on KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| You know, my roots are in the fire service many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| and so I'm impressed with what Chief Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| and Chief Sharp do on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| watching the transformation of law enforcement and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| over the last two decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| an incredibly professional, accredited organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| So just some bullets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| 416 authorized officers, 380 sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| I know that Mayor O'Hara mentioned this to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| that there's a recruit class now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| There is ongoing recruitment happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| all of the time for police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| As many of you know, it's a challenging time to recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| The economy is doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| Unemployment is low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| And plus, just the challenges of law enforcement now with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| it's a hard job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| and it's become harder over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| But with that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| Chief Thomas and others have been working with civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| and with the other functions of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| to help support recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| And how do we keep officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| how do we recruit officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| and are there unique ways that we can recruit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| So we're doing continuous postings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| current recruit class, back-to-back recruit classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| We've looked at our system for selecting officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| We have implemented a lateral recruitment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| So I think the message is we want to get to that full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| actual sworn officer, 380,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| and we're working diligently to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| And Chief Thomas, I'm not sure if you have any thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| or a harrow on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| I just want to add, as we said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| we budget at the 416,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| so that's not something we have to add to the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| when we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Can I just ask, how many are in the current recruit class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| We've got an academy that's going to graduate in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| that's 10, and we had hoped for 35 in that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| So it's just our recruitment pools have really gone...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| Did we start with 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| We started with 10, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Started with 10, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| You know, I'm always impressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| with just the number of responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| that KPD does on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| and it's, again, a backbone of our neighborhood security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| and safety and the relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| that our neighbors have with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| Fire department, very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| Thousands of calls, over 25,000 calls last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| with 47,000 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| and again, Chief Sharp and the team that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| I know Chief Compton and others are here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| and Chief Morris are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Just a professional organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| There is currently a recruit class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| Chief, do you want to talk about the recruit class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| Because it's a larger recruit class right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| and we're seeing just a great organization with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| Yeah, this is one of the largest recruit classes we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| We started with 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| I actually started with 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| We had one dropout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| We've had two that actually deployed on the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| so they didn't get to finish, but they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| So we'll be graduating 32 recruits tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| Everyone's invited, 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| Severe Heights Baptist Church on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| It's been a really good class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| This class brings us to full strength or within one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| Thank you very much, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| And so, you know, if you look at the vast majority of responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| obviously it's the first responder EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| You can see the number of overdoses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| But there's all the other activities in addition to the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| and medical and rescue responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| There's a fire education, the fire training house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| We've got incredible relationships with not only Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| but our EMA state and local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| So seven firefighters were deployed to South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| and oftentimes that is the case with major incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| throughout our region and in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| And we're fortunate to have resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| and a great team to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| So I'm going to talk about a specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| I know we had a workshop on the Tenova opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| for the public safety complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| which would include or will include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| the Knoxville Police Department, Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| the pension offices, and municipal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| And so I have been leading a series of tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| Actually, Councilwoman Welch and I were there this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| and I have a series scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| Dr. Lyons and I met with representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| of the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| their executive board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| There is a tour with that board, the executive board, on the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| Actually dropping some hard copies of this larger presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| to that group as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| And so this project, again, is a longstanding investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| I think the mayor and even previous mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| Mayor Brown and Mayor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| identified the need to find a new location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| and an investment in the operational facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| for these key core services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| So the $40 million, that number is what has been budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| As you can see on the screen above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| and as we presented at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| this project fits very nicely on a portion of the Tenova campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| Tenova Hospital has closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| We've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| The city did not have a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| or a portion of a decision in the closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| so we had nothing to do with the closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| That was a business decision by Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| Could you repeat that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| It was a business decision by Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| So we, again, the KPD, KFD pension court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| fit very well in existing facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| with the addition of a new court building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| All the other buildings are existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| with a parking structure, plenty of surface lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| and potentially a location to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| or exploring the idea of some urgent care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| As we know that Fort Sanders Covenant Health and UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| have seen an influx as a result of the closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| of the emergency room here at the Tenova site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| There's also an opportunity for redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| on the north site, the shaded green area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| and potentially the preservation of the historic hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| Walked through that again this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| and it's an impressive structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| has an incredible history to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| And then the Clark Tower, which is that square in white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| the city does not have a need for that square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| 90,000 square feet, but we're working with the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| and other groups, non-profit organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| to see if there's a potential use or reuse of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| There's significant resources that would have to be put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| So this project has many puzzle pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| I think you will see a request from redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| to initiate a redevelopment area just on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| That allows us to have some tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| should this project move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| We'll be back to city council with some other agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| but wanted to highlight this important investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| for our core services of police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| Before we get too far, I want to go back to the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| There you go, there's fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| So I'd like to ask the 698 overdose calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| do we know whether or not that is an increase from last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| or the prior year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| We saw exponential increase for the last three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| but this year compared to the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| it is finally just about leveled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| It's not gone down, but it's leveled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| It's up just a small percentage over the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| So that's a little bit of a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| It's still obviously way too high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| but we have seen the growth just about level off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| And then one other question for Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| So could you maybe just tell us briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| Could you speak a little louder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| Could you tell us briefly, Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| what the Type A and Type B crimes are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| Type A is crimes against persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| things like homicide, rape, aggravated assaults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| and Type B is property-type crimes, break-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| And is that number higher or lower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| Are we seeing a downward trend, upward trend, or is it flat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| Our crimes against persons were just an uptick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| I think we haven't done our final numbers yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| but maybe 1% or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| The property crimes have been going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| I think we were somewhere between 8% and 13% down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| Rough numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| All right, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| All right, so transitioning, again, still in core services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| And this is a big overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| Again, we could have very detailed presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| for each of these subjects and departments within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6535)|
| 1:49:02| So public works, and that includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| the Public Service Department, Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| Fleet, and Engineering, and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| So if you look in total, that's over 520 public works employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| in those departments, 110 million in operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| And again, they manage everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| and I'm going to zip through this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| If you have specific questions, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| But I do show on the right, we're in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| That was a priority that oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| these facility upgrades take many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| That was initiated early in the Haslam administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| funding for a study followed by acquisition of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| And the building that we're in now is a consolidation of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| into a single professional office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| really for the foreseeable 50 to 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| So everything from leaf collection to paving to sanitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| I think it's important to note that a large portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| of our sanitation is to our vendor waste connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| that pick up the majority of our household garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| and the recycling and bulky waste in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| City crews do leaves and brush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| and then we have a robust system for downtown garbage service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| that the city does, and that has grown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| as we've seen growth and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| in our central business district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| Just a few more slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| and we're going to talk more about sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| when we talk a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| So everything from sidewalks to signalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| to pavement, street markings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| On the top right is snow response, stormwater pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| mowing, maintenance of all of our park systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| I could sit here and list all of the things we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| We would be here a long time, and you'd prefer not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| So I cannot say enough about the men and women in Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| I always say they are the behind-the-scenes folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| that make the city run every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| and you only think about them if it doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| If you get your garbage mist, or if there's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| Again, you don't think about salt and plows until there's snow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| and then you think about it, and you call Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| So lots of good things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| We'll talk more in detail here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| And we're going to transition now to investing in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| Right. I get the lucky part, the people part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| You know, we are a municipal corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| and you heard that sort of gives you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| It sounds kind of clinical and corporate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| worrying about where the dollars come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| and that's absolutely critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| and that's what we spent the first part here and for Mr. York on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| But aside from all of the physical things that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| and the development that we do and the taxes that we collect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| it really is about the people who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| And I think as we've gone through the last few years under Mayor O'Hara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| we've become much more intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| Not that this wasn't always a key part of what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| but much more intentional about the equity piece, the inclusion piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| making sure that this city works for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| provides opportunity for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| and we've addressed a couple topics that weren't even on the city government agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| just really three or four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| Now, housing has always been out there as something that we participate in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| but that's been mainly a federal set of federal programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| And as the federal government has withdrawn, to put a mild word on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6748)|
| 1:52:34| from a lot of this arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| then we have started stepping in and filling major parts of that gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| at the local government level with local government funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| Take affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| This is a topic that we really didn't hear that much about until two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6767)|
| 1:52:55| That's how recent this has come into the narrative about city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| I know you hear about it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| We think about it every day because it is a very critical component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| of being the kind of city that we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| And affordable housing is provided by a complex set of actors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| who we work with and built on a complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| and we think very effective set of relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| We have up there the list of the actors that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| We've got non-profit housing assistance organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| You all know of CAC and there are other non-profits in the housing world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| You've got non-profit developers, people who are in the housing world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| but they're not actually in the for-profit mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| And you have seen much of their work as well, KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| Helen Rodman-McNass and Archodo's Foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| And then the for-profit developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| And the challenge, of course, with the for-profit developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| is that building affordable housing, the fixed cost in building any decent housing unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6833)|
| 1:54:01| if you can't recover a certain amount of rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| that world has to have some supplemental income other than rent to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| And that's where we come in on the governmental sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| both working with our federal partners as well as using our own funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| I do want to just clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| Bill said that just the last couple of years there's been a focus on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| The city has focused on it for decades through community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| But I think what you mean is just in terms of the public being aware of the increased need for more rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6867)|
| 1:54:36| And that's where we've seen a lot more public discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| But it's something that through the community development department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| and through a lot of these players, as just shown on this previous slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| through public meetings, that's been going on for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| Right. I'm very glad you pointed that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| It's just post-recession and in a thriving economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| more existing affordable rental units as they completed their affordability period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6900)|
| 1:55:09| as you all know, then we're moving to market rate apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| And so we've had to double down on how to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| And that's what we'll be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| Right. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| Yes, we have not only been going on a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| and we have Becky Wade who spent her previous career at KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| We have people here working on this for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| I mean, it's been a critical part at all levels, including the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| but it's really become a major part of the public narrative just in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| I'm glad you clarified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| And we not only build new community development mainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| it doesn't only involve itself in the construction of new units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| but it's protecting the existing stock is a key part of what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| keeping the housing affordable and in the kind of condition that we really want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6951)|
| 1:55:57| a quality of life for people who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| And that's done through a series of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| And, again, Becky Wade is here and Linda Rust if you want to get any detail on any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| Owner-occupied rehab, rental rehab, energy efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| that goes not only through community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| but also through our sustainability efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| And you all know of the major KEEM program we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| and we'll talk about that a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| that put large amounts of funds working with TVA into repairs that allowed somebody to stay in their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6983)|
| 1:56:31| because the utility bills became something that didn't overwhelm them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| I mean, you pay rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| If your rent is reasonable and your KUB bill is $400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| that's not really going to help you stay in your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| Accessibility is a key part of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| And we have accessibility improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| We have programs for them and also lead pain abatement to make sure that these homes are safe for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| is a key component as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| I actually started in community development, economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| These programs have been ongoing for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| ongoing, incremental, every year, slow and steady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| I feel like sometimes in the affordable housing discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| we forget about all this longstanding work that helps people stay in their houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| and live there in an affordable way, especially the KEEM program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| Lowering utility bills $100 to $300 a month has an incredible impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| Not just KEEM, but also the KUB Round It Up program that we all continue to invest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| Right, and we have been involved in explicit placement of city dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| into very large and effective programs that have been very helpful over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| I think everybody who drives down MLK and see the great transformation in the Five Points area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7059)|
| 1:57:45| and we're working with our partner, KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| and we have spent about a nine- or ten-year effort that's gone across a couple of administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| to then do a program at the level that we would like to do involving large amounts of local funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7074)|
| 1:58:02| again, because federal funds weren't available at the level that they had previously been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| And the Five Points project over time with KCDC has brought in over 1,000 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7086)|
| 1:58:15| along with our Affordable Rental Development Fund, and 462 for Five Points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| and then 597 when we get to the Redevelopment Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| That's $13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| That goes into infrastructure that supports the development of city capital funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| leveraging $73 million of other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| Now, you're all familiar with the Affordable Rental Development Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| That is the fund that wasn't around just a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| We funded it for two years, and obviously we will be continuing to fund that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| and coming to you with continued requests for funding for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| That began two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| As I said, we went $2 million and then $2.5 million to get up to $4.5 of city funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7133)|
| 1:59:00| That largely works with our for-profit developer partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7140)|
| 1:59:07| And then you've seen a number of projects that have come up under that fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| the Restoration House, Middlebrook Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| We have Young High Flats that's coming along as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| We are very pleased, and I really want to compliment Becky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| and everybody on her staff at the effective use of city knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| to leverage not only that kind of investment we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| but to leverage units that basically are serving 1,400 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7171)|
| 1:59:38| 597 units, that's about 1,400 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| And those are people who are now or will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| counting those that are in the pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| in affordable and really high-quality housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| And we're very purposeful when possible, especially on the larger projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| to have those near public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| and that obviously keeps them an element of the affordability as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| I guess one item we're going to talk later about RECO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| and I know you had a workshop last night so we won't spend too much time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| but the impacts on RECO for the ability to have sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| that help meet this need is also an incredibly important factor for all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7213)|
| 2:00:20| Now one thing that we have done, and actually city council voted on this a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| was to say let's give the mayor authority to grant a payment in lieu of taxes, a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| You all are very familiar with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7231)|
| 2:00:32| We've discussed many of those over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| For affordable housing, without going through any but-for process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| without taking it to council, to be able to effectively deliver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| and make that commitment to those projects so that people who want to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| have confidence that they will be able to not have their taxes increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7250)|
| 2:00:55| once they create an affordable housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| This is critical because having that pilot makes that project possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| I mean all of these would survive any but-for test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| They make the project possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| They're part of the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| And they're also supplemented by our placing money through the affordable housing fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| that community development implements in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| So when you see a project, not only will it have some gap funding that's been evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| through the fund, it will also not be subject to increased property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| That pilot period extends during the length of the affordability period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| Mayor O'Hara mentioned that some of the projects do come off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| and are committed X numbers of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| and they have come off because of the demand for housing of the affordability focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| and gone market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| These are committed to be long-term projects that serve people for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| and the pilot will go along with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| We have Arbor Place, Tillery Place, Holston Oaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| and you all can see what many of the others are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| To pause a second on this, this is really critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| because as we support affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| they are not going to produce property tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| and we're also putting additional money from city funds into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| We're doing this because it's absolutely essential, the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| and a high priority in the way we look at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| But it means we're obviously going to be counting at other sources of tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| in order to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| So as we develop just in our housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| this assures that not only are we going to have an amount of that housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7349)|
| 2:02:34| supported through a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| but it also basically depends on economic success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| and activity in other areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| Bill, let me ask a quick question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| What is the average affordability period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| I think I will defer to Becky on that, the average affordability period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| It's right around 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| So these new projects are going to be there quite a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| and I'm assuming that subsequent councils and administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| are going to be continuing to support these sort of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| so we have a good solid base of quality affordable housing in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| Can I ask a quick question on that, probably for Becky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| So when we partner with or do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| when KCDC creates new affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| that's permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| But when we create new affordable housing through partnering with private entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| or I guess some of them are for-profit, some of them are non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7412)|
| 2:03:39| that's not permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7419)|
| 2:03:46| It's 10, 15, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7426)|
| 2:03:53| For a non-profit agency to have a mission of affordability of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| for example, the picture of Millbrook Gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| that was developed by the Holocaust McNamara Center to house veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| That's permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| That's their mission, that's what that was created for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| Same thing with Restoration House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| They have a mission to do supportive housing for families with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| So that's their mission and that's permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| The private developers that receive low-income housing tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| have an affordability period that they commit to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| and typically that's 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| So that's what they've committed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| that's what our firms have committed them to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| But in the past, some will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| Well, I was going to say, do any of them ever continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| Most of them continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| Those examples there of rehabilitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| a lot of those are owned by LHP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| They have re-upped and are back to get rehab tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| to improve the properties and reinstate their affordability period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| Because that's their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| That's what they do is operate affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| And if you look over at Arbor Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| all the units that are just east of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| a lot of those have stayed under this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| and also had massive improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| and are much, much better units than they were prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| So I think the typical case is for those sorts of units to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| Some do roll off, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7535)|
| 2:05:42| Obviously, we'd love for everybody to have a decent place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| an affordable place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| and as we all know that isn't always the case for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| And we spent a lot of time recently discussing affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7552)|
| 2:05:56| We have spent an awful lot of time discussing homelessness over the years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7556)|
| 2:06:01| Like affordable housing, that involves a partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| a series of partnerships and direction of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| and many actors and players in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| There are federal funds that flow through the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| They go out to agencies through the continuum of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| We have state funds with the Tennessee Housing Development Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| and it goes a lot to agency grants to deliver services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| both to prevent homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| and to help those who are homeless to get back into a home, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7585)|
| 2:06:33| We have approximately a million dollars of local funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| that are going into grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| Now we have the day space you're familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| We also support a lot of case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| which is also critical in many cases for keeping people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| not only helping those who are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| but keeping people from becoming homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| Low-barrier shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| Probably by this time most of you have heard about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| This is a proposal that's still being evaluated by Salvation Army and VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| We're optimistic that we will get to success there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| That will be in a location that's very near the interstate pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| that you see there on the Salvation Army property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| but that's not finalized yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| That is a gap that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| We have obviously the partners who provide shelter, CARM and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7643)|
| 2:07:32| We have many that can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| There are still barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| They're minimum, but there are barriers to getting into that shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| What we need is a shelter that anybody can go to, literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| who needs to get shelter from the elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| And that's what this would be about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| and would help fill in the pieces of the serving homelessness puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| And the low-barrier shelter, as Bruce Spangler will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| has a focus on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| So you come in there because your focus is to get off the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| and to seek housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| which is not necessarily the focus of anyone going into an emergency shelter, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| They're coming in from the elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| But this is targeted to really help those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| who can't now qualify or desire to go into existing emergency shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| but are willing to work with VMC to actually get their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7701)|
| 2:08:29| Also, look at all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| When you look at those partners, those are just some of the partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| We still have the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness, where quarterly we meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| and we have, I don't know, 30-plus people who come to that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| representing a number of organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| So when you look at these figures for the money that we really touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| and move out into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| you have to multiply that five, ten times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7732)|
| 2:08:57| of money that's being spent in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| to try and address prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| and getting people to support services and getting people back into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| and long-term support through our permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| A lot of money is being raised and is being invested in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| to try and help individuals who are facing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| And to talk a bit about the area under the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| you see the two pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| That saves the day space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| That investment is very purposeful to not have the most minimal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| we think unacceptable standards for any human habitation that existed prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| as you can see in the top photo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| and have that be a place that people can go during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| with the idea of getting in, being provided services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| being connected with providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| and anything from counseling to escape prostitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7789)|
| 2:09:52| to having people who can help make arrangements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| to get the services folks need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| and possibly set them up to get into one of the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| That area is one to help people get out of that status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| rather than to enable people to stay in a very unacceptable set of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| that are bad not only for them, for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| I think we all knew the series of problems that presented there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| and we're going to continue to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| Public service, David Brace taking a large lead in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| KPD in helping with the safety in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7824)|
| 2:10:29| plus security for folks who are under that bridge area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| are all part of that equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| Bill, I think it was appropriate when you said safe space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| because that is also what this affords people who are homeless at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7841)|
| 2:10:46| There was a lot of victimization going on prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| So people now know that if they have something going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| they can go to that space, and it is safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| and they can access services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| Beyond the human component, there's also just a water quality component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7859)|
| 2:11:02| Second Creek is right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| and so obviously stormwater and what was running into Second Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| because of the lack of base facilities, restrooms, potable water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| This has also served as a conduit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| There are a lot of people that want to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| They're energized to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| And so the security that is there in many ways can help people that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7879)|
| 2:11:25| literally people will pull up with a car and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| we want to hand out food or we want to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| And so we help communicate to them, hey, here are some other ways to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| Why don't you connect with one of these longstanding partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| so that the help can be in a way that's positive for all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| including those in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| And so we are also tracking usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| and it's the security that's down there is kind of doing a pencil check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| of a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| So we'd like to be able to report back to you in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| on what's the usage during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| I think we need to get 12 months under our belt in a warmer season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| I think now when it is cold, being out in the sun when it's not raining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| may limit some usage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| But I think as it gets warm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| people will utilize that shaded space and the tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| and we'll get back to you on those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| There were more people there yesterday than I've seen because it was quite warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| Yeah, I think it's also building that relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| So we have case managers, we have social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| that are engaging and building relationships with folks that need resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| and oftentimes building that trust of what this space is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| that the security guards are really there for the security of the folks that are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7954)|
| 2:12:40| They're not there in a negative way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| They're really there to provide security that if you want to go in and rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| and you want to feel safe, charge your cell phone, get a drink of water, use a restroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| you've got a safe place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| We had the opportunity to meet with some of the people who were providing those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| It was really a very moving experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| And when they came into Mayor O'Hara's office, they know folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| The case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7985)|
| 2:13:06| The case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7986)|
| 2:13:07| They know folks by name, their stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| and there's an awful lot of work that can go in just getting somebody who is trusting enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| and wants to take that next step to reengaging with society through the services that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| But that's a lot of very difficult work that involves a major human component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| and investment with people providing them, and that's part of what that million dollars is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| You'll see a few more improvements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| We're going to do some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| Actually, when the design was done, we went down and met with folks in that area to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8012)|
| 2:13:38| what other needs do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8019)|
| 2:13:40| Some things came up, like a cell phone charging station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8020)|
| 2:13:44| So we're going to do some painting just to kind of beautify the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| We're actually going to wrap the columns on the interstate with some type of attractive wrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8028)|
| 2:13:55| So we're going to try to make just the area visually more improved and attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| And so you'll see those happening as it gets warmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| It was difficult to do some of that work in the middle of the winter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| but Chad and engineering are working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| I was just going to say, do we know how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8048)|
| 2:14:10| Dr. Spangler confirmed for me that the social workers are going out since so many folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8050)|
| 2:14:16| especially in the very cold, were not in the shade under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| They were up at Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| How far are the social workers going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| What kind of information do we have on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| Because a lot of folks who moved from under the bridge are now sleeping around on business stoops and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8066)|
| 2:14:34| and I just want to make sure that they're getting really up towards Woodland and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8074)|
| 2:14:39| is where I'm seeing more of the homeless population scattered about and away from the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8079)|
| 2:14:46| My understanding is they are going to where the need is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| We are also obviously building relationships, and KPD is handling Officer Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| If you've not met Officer Clinton, fabulous police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| Go ahead, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| Officer Clinton, homeless outreach is his mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| and he has been going out into the other areas where people have dispersed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| and connecting those providers with those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| So he's been following the transient population where they've been going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8115)|
| 2:15:20| We've been making an awful lot of investment in making the city accessible for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8120)|
| 2:15:26| and we have a disability services office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| and all of our departments work in concert with that office and Stephanie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8129)|
| 2:15:34| and we continue to invest large dollars over years in all kinds of facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| to make sure everything from parks being accessible to our facilities, our recreation facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8139)|
| 2:15:47| and that's ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| So we're going to continue to be really discussing neighborhood infrastructure now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8151)|
| 2:15:56| and infrastructure that helps connect and improve the health of those in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| And so, again, we have a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| Well, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| We are in the process of starting our comprehensive sidewalk study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| So as many of you know, for new sidewalks, the older model was a call-in model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8169)|
| 2:16:17| So people would call in and say they wanted a new sidewalk, and we would evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| That was a model that I think oftentimes left out parts of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| and so this comprehensive study is not about condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| Right, Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| It's not about condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| So we're talking about connectivity and missing links.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| And so we know a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| We've got those on the list, and we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| If you look at sidewalk projects in development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| there are a number that we are funding and working on at various stages right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8203)|
| 2:16:48| and the mayor actually has increased funding for that in the current budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| And so I think the goal would be to hand a new team here in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| I think it's going to take about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8218)|
| 2:17:00| Is that correct, Jim, to complete the sidewalk study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| We'll brief back council and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| but really the next mayor is going to come in and have a guide for sidewalks in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| that's comprehensive, that weighs all of the factors related to new sidewalk construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8232)|
| 2:17:18| We do significant work on our existing system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| So we have a sidewalk network that is a facility that ages and needs to be repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8242)|
| 2:17:28| A repair is a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| You really can't go in and patch up a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| You take it out, you put a new sidewalk in, and it's there for another 40 to 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| So we also do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| We also have a curb cut program, again, related to accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| So there's a lot bundled into sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| And, again, if council ever needs more information on that, that's its own presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| But, again, the study, significant number of projects that are at a number of different stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| It could be the preliminary design, right-of-way, construction document design, bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8276)|
| 2:18:04| And they take time because of the need oftentimes to buy some property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8284)|
| 2:18:09| But large list, and, again, we can get you more details as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8289)|
| 2:18:15| So sidewalks and greenways, these are the ways that we connect our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| and they're also a great way to stay healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| So walking, connectivity, being able to get to a transit stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| being able to get from your house to a park on a sidewalk or greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| being able to walk or ride to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| And so right now we have a number of projects in development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| I think all of you know about the Northwest Greenway Connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| There's two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| One is in the right-of-way phase right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| which is from the pedestrian bridge over Western to Victor Ashe Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| which is a large regional park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| We were also funded state TDOT dollars, enhancement dollars, to go from Western to Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8331)|
| 2:18:59| Now that's much earlier in its phasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| Using federal money is great, but we have to do several things extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| That takes some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| Just the process takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| But that is funded through this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| We are also looking at the Fulton High School to Cecil Avenue connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8353)|
| 2:19:17| which is First Creek, that First Creek connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| So we just finished one by Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| This would get you from Fulton to Cecil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| We know there's that intersection there at Cecil and Broadway is an important connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8364)|
| 2:19:29| and that is being evaluated now by the engineering team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| Williams Creek, there's property that has been bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| It's in the Williams Creek, really kind of urban forest area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| So from Brooks Road up to Chestnut and then the ability to get up to the botanical gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| And then a big priority that's early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| but I think is the next one that Parks and Rec will be asking for city dollars for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| is the East Knox Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| That is from Caswell Park up to the botanical gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| That's an important priority for that community portion of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8398)|
| 2:20:03| There are also greenway projects throughout the city that we work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| Public service is responsible for facility maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| We do small neighborhood connections and trails in the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| and what the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club does with other types of greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| These are the 10-foot wide asphalt greenway connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| the traditional greenways throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| Oh, I also forgot to mention, you all know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| we have a long-term, like the sidewalk study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| we have a long-term plan that helps guide our greenway decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| Again, to help guide not only this administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| but as other administrations come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| there's a document to say here's where it needs to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| That's a long-term plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| I think there were about 40-plus million in greenway projects in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| So that's not a two-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| It's really a 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Or 20, the mayor said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| So speaking of greenways and sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| it's all about how we move people through our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| We're incredibly fortunate to have the Knoxville Area Transit CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8461)|
| 2:21:06| Melissa is here, the team at CAT, as many of you knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| Melissa is the acting director now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| Melissa, raise your hand. Here she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| She's done that, I think this is her third, is it third time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| Fourth time as the acting CAT director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| We're working on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| But the ability for us to help move everyone throughout the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| but especially those that need to get from their home to their place of employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8488)|
| 2:21:33| to get kids from their home to places of employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| or to the Change Center or other recreational facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8498)|
| 2:21:41| And so I think the mayor has shown an incredible commitment to transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8501)|
| 2:21:47| and we look forward to moving that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8507)|
| 2:21:53| So this is going to be like the public works slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8513)|
| 2:21:57| There are so many things that we do in the world of parks and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| And I've just got some pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| So again, the ability for citizens to walk to a community park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8526)|
| 2:22:12| to take transit or drive or ride your bike to a regional park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| Again, the neighborhood park is where you walk with your kids and you walk your dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| and you enjoy a time right in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| But you may go to a regional park to play a sporting event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8542)|
| 2:22:27| to spend a longer day with your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| We have pools, rec centers right in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| The kids with the green shirts on, we have a summer rec program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8553)|
| 2:22:38| And it's one of those things that many people don't know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8558)|
| 2:22:41| but for an incredibly economical price, kids can have an engaging experience during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8561)|
| 2:22:47| Cheryl Ely is here to my right and is last year her and Aaron, the deputy director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8567)|
| 2:22:54| looked at how that program runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| What can we do to enhance it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| Can we have longer hours that meet the needs of parents' working schedules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| How can we make sure that the activities can be enjoyed by all members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8582)|
| 2:23:08| So there's the day-to-day recreational activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| and then there's a small fee for going up to Pigeon Forge to ride go-karts or to go to a pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8591)|
| 2:23:17| And so that program has been, I think, revamped and will continue to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| And then you just see play sets and swimming pools, and we take kids to climbing gyms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| And it's also all ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| In many ways, our rec centers are from the very young all the way up to seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8609)|
| 2:23:35| We have three pools, really four pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| One of those is leased out to the folks with emerald youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8618)|
| 2:23:43| We have the adaptive rec center and then two outdoor pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| Excuse me, two indoor pools because we have one south too, a south recreation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| But, again, those are important for people, especially kids in the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| to have a place to go that's safe and they get exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| And so we need to continue to support these and have made a big commitment to that over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8637)|
| 2:24:04| Okay, so we do a lot to work with our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8644)|
| 2:24:09| We've already mentioned some direct programs that the city offers through Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8649)|
| 2:24:14| We also do a lot of work with our partners, with non-profit partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8654)|
| 2:24:20| You all know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| As a community, we've invested in them, volunteered with them, worked with them for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8662)|
| 2:24:27| Groups like Boys and Girls Club, Emerald Youth, Girl Talk, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and 100 Black Men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8667)|
| 2:24:36| A lot of different groups that are out there that work with our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| some with facilities and some more in a mentoring capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| So through grants, through Avis' community relations department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8684)|
| 2:24:50| we help leverage the private dollars that they raise to provide support and opportunities for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8690)|
| 2:24:58| Here are a few examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| Save Our Sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| As you know, about five years ago, we also started the Save Our Sons initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| which particularly focused on perhaps the most vulnerable group of youth in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8706)|
| 2:25:12| which were young men and boys of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| We saw through the statistics that if you were a young African-American man or boy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8715)|
| 2:25:22| you had a much greater chance in being affected by crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8722)|
| 2:25:29| in violent crime, either by being the perpetrator or by being the victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8729)|
| 2:25:36| And so we knew as a community that we needed to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8736)|
| 2:25:42| So many of the youth-serving groups that we already talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| many community leaders came together to focus on Save Our Sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| We also have a roundtable, as we do with the Homeless Roundtable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| that I attend, that I chair, but Avis really staffs, she and her team staffs that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8754)|
| 2:26:01| And we're pulling together all these different nonprofits to really identify a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8761)|
| 2:26:07| to identify how we can advance their work and the city's work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| to create more opportunities for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| So some examples, the Chain Center opening, as you all know well about the Emerald Youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8774)|
| 2:26:21| the sports complex and educational facility in Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8781)|
| 2:26:28| the block party at the Urban Wilderness Gateway Park just last week, I guess, or two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8788)|
| 2:26:35| KPD announced with Big Brothers and Big Sisters a special mentoring program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8795)|
| 2:26:41| where our officers and others mentor, sign up to mentor the kids, the littles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8801)|
| 2:26:48| And so that's called Go Big Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| There's one of our officers there and his mentee that he's had for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8810)|
| 2:26:55| It was a really great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| And I have to say I was truly impressed by both of our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8817)|
| 2:27:04| and by the story that they shared about how their experience as a mentor has been important to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8824)|
| 2:27:11| and not just to the young men that they mentored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8831)|
| 2:27:16| Another example there on the right is Parks and Rec completed a playground renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8836)|
| 2:27:22| and the kids couldn't have been happier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| You see them there at West Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| So now we want to move on to the bigger ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| those economic development initiatives and major infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8851)|
| 2:27:38| that really create the opportunities to grow that tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| and to meet the needs of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| And here you see some of the examples that we're going to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| So let's, I think, David, are you going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| Yep. So we'll jump into these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| Actually, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8875)|
| 2:27:56| Yeah, Bill will jump in and start with Rico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| We're going to bounce back and forth on these big ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| I think we discussed this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| Investment is a critical economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| Investment, the ability to be competitive with other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| for keeping talent, attracting talent, bringing jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| And so investment matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| We can't grow the tax base just through inflation, but we've got to have investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8893)|
| 2:28:18| Right, and I'll add one other limit we have on growing the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| For years, cities grew by annexing, reaching out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| People would develop greenfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| The city would annex the greenfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| We were no exception, and some might say we were fairly aggressive about that over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| And that has all been eliminated by action of the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| So in order for us to grow, we have to grow from the inside out through redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8920)|
| 2:28:46| And we're thrilled with that because not only, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8926)|
| 2:28:50| we took that stance under the past two mayors purposefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8930)|
| 2:28:55| because we did not think more sprawl in terms of environmental stewardship for the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8935)|
| 2:29:01| was the right way to go through the outgrowth and annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| Rather, we thought we had great opportunity in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8946)|
| 2:29:09| not only to provide places for folks to live and shop and play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8949)|
| 2:29:15| to grow the tax base, which was essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| and to do it in a way that made us a really functional urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| Now, recode, I don't think anybody in here needs a lot of talk about recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| other than to say that it does provide a fundamental building block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8967)|
| 2:29:32| for that to happen in an efficient way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| and that is through the corridor being open to mixed use and much more intense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8974)|
| 2:29:41| That will help in greater housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| It will at least indirectly and in some cases directly help with the affordable housing challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8983)|
| 2:29:48| and it will be an effective way for us to take the next step as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| to grow our tax base and provide the services we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8992)|
| 2:29:56| And I've got, what, 30 slides on recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| Do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| We'd like a good five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| Yeah, all right. Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| Let's talk infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| Right, and in order, when we talk about corridors and the core of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| and the tax base and all the opportunities there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| I think all of you have noticed the tremendous transformation on the south across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9012)|
| 2:30:19| Severe Avenue streetscapes is absolutely critical to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| We've invested large dollars, 10 million street state improvement project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| that some of it is laying before us like the roundabout that's coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9028)|
| 2:30:34| But all of that, I think no better and more obvious lesson for anybody who traverses that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| can be that that public attention, that infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| including the investment across in the old Baptist Hospital site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190208MidYearBudgetRetreat?start=9043)|
