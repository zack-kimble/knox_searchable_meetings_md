| 0:00:15| County Commission work session for the month of March. And Commissioner Bussler, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=15)|
| 0:00:28| the seventh month of commission. So if there are any voice votes, you don't have to worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=28)|
| 0:00:34| But if there's a roll call vote required, you will be the lead off voter this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=34)|
| 0:00:41| the seventh month of commission. Also, you have the honor of if you would lead us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=41)|
| 0:00:48| the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=48)|
| 0:01:19| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. We will now enter into establishing the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=79)|
| 0:01:31| We will have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=91)|

| 0:01:52| All members are present. Thank you, Madam Clerk. As we were, as I was beginning to say there a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=112)|
| 0:02:00| establishing today's agenda. Now I'm going back up for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=120)|
| 0:02:10| I saw several of my fellow commissioners across the street earlier this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| and it is with a great deal of pleasure that I think that I can announce here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| the Board of Education has selected a superintendent for Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=142)|
| 0:02:31| and that would be Plano Bob Thomas. Please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=151)|
| 0:02:51| You've been around a lot longer than I have, but we'll both be around for a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| and I really appreciate your dedication to the Board of Education, to the school kids here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| and look forward, along with my fellow commissioners, to serving with the rest of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=184)|
| 0:03:11| and implementing the best school district in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=191)|
| 0:03:22| Normally I start with ads to the agenda. I believe we have one ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=202)|
| 0:03:29| I would ask Mr. Dwight Vandervate to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| I have a communication from him of something that is just now coming up that has to do with community ratings as a part of FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=213)|
| 0:03:45| Mr. Vandervate, could you give a brief description?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| We have a hazard mitigation plan that we update every five years that is part of what's called a community rating system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| all of which is under the FEMA umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| These are the evaluative tools that insurers use to establish insurance rates that FEMA uses to judge us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| from our standpoint of preparedness and readiness for disaster mitigation and related tasks of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=250)|
| 0:04:18| We are due to update the plan, and this year we have approached both the City of Knoxville and the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| The obligation fundamentally is Knox County's because it is a county plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| We approached the City of Knoxville and the Town of Farragut, and both of them have agreed to participate with us this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| That's a big step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| From a financial standpoint, this is not a terrible expense, but it does help a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| More importantly, from a policy standpoint, FEMA views an update of this nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| where all jurisdictions have participated from both a policy and a financial standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| as a more robust plan and a more genuinely multi-jurisdictional plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| We're really excited about the City's participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| We're just extra excited about Farragut's because that is absolutely new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| Unfortunately, what that means is we have pressed the Law Director's Office into service on short notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| to put together an agreement under which this can be authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| We will have that agreement for you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| I spoke to Daniel Sanders today, and Mr. Armstrong had assigned him to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| He assures me it will be ready, but we just need to add a caption approving this agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| and then we'll have documentation for you on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Right. This will be added and discussed later as an unnumbered addition to today's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| It will be without recommendation to full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| and it will also be pending upon whether or not the Law Department can get it out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| Thank you, Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Also, I'd like to say that items 35 and 44 are withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| 35 and 44 are withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| Are there other items to add, defer, or withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=361)|
| 0:06:12| Seeing no further discussion on that, looking at the items that we will discuss today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=372)|
| 0:06:25| I feel confident that we will discuss 54 and 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| That's the Helen Ross McNabb Behavioral Center on 54 and the lease on 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=389)|
| 0:06:40| Are there other items that, my fellow commissioners, you would wish to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=400)|
| 0:06:49| Okay. The issuance of bonds is 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| The approval of having a resolution of bonds is 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| So 45, 46, 54, 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=418)|
| 0:07:06| Are there other items that you would like to have discussed today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| Seeing no further discussion, do I hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=434)|
| 0:07:31| any other questions of any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| If not, do I hear a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| I move the agenda be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| That all be added, deferred, withdrawn, and the agenda be set for those items we will discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| The motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| All others are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Who is the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| I have before me three public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=499)|
| 0:08:33| A Tyler Crabtree and a Michelle Holtz, both speaking to the behavioral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| Michael Holtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Michael Holtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| I would assume that both would like to speak at the issue when discussed, not at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=524)|
| 0:08:54| If not, continuing on then with public forum, I'd like to introduce Neal Denton, who has asked for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=534)|
| 0:09:05| Some questions have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Thank you for having me about our agricultural committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| The agricultural committee was established in the 1940s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| and it's to contain two farm men, two farm women, three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| And the purpose of the committee has been in the past to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| or back then was to establish educational agendas for our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| In recent years, we've used it primarily as a committee to help us in the hiring process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| when we're hiring new people in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| We're going to set up a meeting for, try to have it May the 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| to introduce some of the people to some of the new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| We have gotten through some federal dollars that come through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| Any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| Where will it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| We will have it here in the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| If you can indulge me for just a few minutes, I'd like to tell you something about our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| We have seven employees that are funded through a combination of county, state, and federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| It has been in operation in Knox County since 1910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| There has been six directors of the extension office here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| ranging from the first one was Mr. Murphy, Pat Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| Right now, we currently have people who work, myself, in adult agriculture and home horticulture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| We have an agent who works in commercial horticulture and with tree care and tree care professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=641)|
| 0:10:49| We have an agent that we share with funds from TSU that works with youth horticulture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| and homeowner horticulture and with 4-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| We have two 4-H agents and a family and consumer science agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| Then we have six positions that are fully federal funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| and they are through monies we call expanded foods and nutrition education program money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| And they work with low-income families on nutritional and financial issues in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=678)|
| 0:11:27| Last year, we had 100,000-plus contacts through our office and all of our different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=687)|
| 0:11:35| We have somewhere around 1,600 full 4-H members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| and our 4-H agents and volunteers have touched about 18,000 youth in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=700)|
| 0:11:48| We do things with the 4-H that include livestock programs, poultry programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=708)|
| 0:11:56| but we also do all kinds of what we call life skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| where we teach and have groups that work on civic programs and things around the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| Our youth are very active in many of the programs that exist here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| Right now in Knox County, we have something between $24 million and $25 million worth of on-farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| or farm gate income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| Now, that's a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| That's what the farmers report to the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| So it may be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| But the other thing, according to a study done in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| if you calculate all the dollars that each person in the state of Tennessee spends for horticultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=760)|
| 0:12:49| and agricultural supplies, things like mowers, having people mow their yard, buying plants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=769)|
| 0:12:57| if you calculate those numbers against all the homeowners in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| it is about a $150 million process, or that's about how many dollars are changing hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=782)|
| 0:13:11| So a lot of what we do now, we're no longer as much cows, sows, and plows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| We're more about pansies and trees and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| But we do a lot of communication education still with the agricultural community through different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=802)|
| 0:13:31| Knox County in 1920 was the fourth largest ag county in the state as far as the number of acres of row crops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=811)|
| 0:13:41| But TVA and other things in development has taken a lot of that land away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| But we're still very active, and we have a very active ag program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| And we actually have the second largest cattlemen's organization in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| So there's still a lot of agriculture going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| If not, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Thank you, Mr. Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the January 17th and February 21st meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=850)|

| 0:14:52| It's regarding the issuance of not to exceed $99 million general obligation bonds of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| I recognize Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| I have nothing to say unless you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| We have a questioner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| I read in the documentation that this bond issue has an allowable up to 5% interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| What do you anticipate the market will bear on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| And when will the first interest payments be due on these bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| We actually probably got that stuff today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| I think in our initial meeting we were thinking somewhere less than four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| We're going to issue fixed rate bonds, of course, 20 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| And we will always set up where we pay some principal to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| and we try to keep level payments throughout every year of our payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| And so we'll get you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| And then we're planning on hoping to go to market the end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| When will payments become due?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| Payments are usually due the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| So we usually set them up biannually, usually one in December and one in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=972)|
| 0:16:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| The fee that we're going to have to pay the bonding company for the $99 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| is that going to be more or less $350,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| It's give or take, anywhere usually between $250,000 and $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| Yes, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| Mr. Caldwell, one quick question in terms of our whole balance sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| I don't have the debt schedule in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| but what debt instruments have we got maybe from prior construction projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| that are getting ready to, you know, come to their end here in the next couple of years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| And I just want to get a feel for the total impact on our balance sheet that this is going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| Yeah, so basically what this will do once we issue these bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| it will take our total debt service from about $615,000 to about $670,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1034)|
| 0:17:24| And then if we hold true to our projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| then we will get it back down to about $623,000 by the year 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| And so keep in mind that when Mayor Burchett came into office, we was at $691,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| so we'll still be below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| And by the time he leaves office in what we would consider FY2019, it will be about $642,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| so paying down about $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| And then we may have some refundings between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| There's nothing now that stands out that's a good refunding opportunity for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1094)|

| 0:18:16| Item number 46, Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| It's authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $99 million in one or more series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| making provision for the issuance, sale, and payment of said bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| establishing the terms thereof and the disposition of proceeds therefrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| and providing for the levy of taxes for the payment of principal of premium, if any, and interest on the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| Page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Item number 54, Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| It's approving a defined services contract with the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| and Helen Ross McNabb Center, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| for Helen Ross to develop and manage a behavioral health urgent care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| Is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Can I make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| I make a motion that we move this to the regular session without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| I'll second it so we can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| It doesn't change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| What we have now is the discussion of the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| I would just like to give people a chance to be here, seeing how we have a work session and a regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| I think that a lot of people have been to a lot of meetings lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| and we're under the impression that this would be something that at least made it to our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| Also, if there is a negative vote on the motion today, it will be discussed at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1211)|
| 0:20:21| So what is before us is a substitute motion to send as no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1221)|
| 0:20:50| Excuse me for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1250)|
| 0:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| The motion that's before us is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| If it were to pass, it would become the primary motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| So we'll have discussion either way you vote here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| All in favor of sending to full commission, no recommendation, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Are we supposed to second the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| The substitute motion is now the motion on the floor as the primary motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| Now we're ready for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1313)|
| 0:22:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| I want to make it perfectly clear to everyone, everyone everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| that I fully support trying to do something to help people who suffer from mental illness and drug addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1330)|
| 0:22:19| We have reached a point in our community that's long overdue to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| So if I question things of this contract and its location, that is not about my desire not for this to go forward and to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1344)|
| 0:22:33| And I just want to make sure everybody understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| I do have some questions about the response to the proposal for Helen Ross-McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1357)|
| 0:23:02| Hey, Jerry, how are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Thank you for being here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1384)|
| 0:23:13| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Jerry Vagner, 201 West Springdale Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| Jerry, how many beds do you have in the facility that's adjacent to this center point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| Center point facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| We are licensed for 49 or 50 beds at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| As we talked the other day, MPC has approved 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| There is a difference between those two figures because licensure gives us more flexibility than the MPC does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| It's my understanding that everybody that's going to be there is going to be of a misdemeanor or low-level crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| I also understand that, and the sheriff may need to answer this and I may need to ask the law director this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| that there has been a compromise made that anybody that leaves the facility will have to be escorted by a sheriff's deputy, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1441)|
| 0:24:09| It is our understanding in conversations with law enforcement that they will transport people in this program to the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| and then again away from the facility upon discharge, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| And I guess this is a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| Do we need to have something in writing from the sheriff's department stating that this is the way this process will work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| Because I trust J.J. will do this, but he may not be the next sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| and we need to have something to extend this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| There is a section, I believe, called the policing station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| or something within the project where we could add a line to transportation of patients in this program, which would be no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1483)|
| 0:24:54| We could probably get it done before next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| In your timetable, it says four months after approval of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| that the crisis stabilization unit will be moved to this new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| That would be the 16 beds that we have and then the 15 beds of the crisis stabilization unit, bringing the total to 31 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Do you have different plans or configuration on how you will do this depending on which level of service is approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| I think you noticed in the proposal there is an alternate bid in there for eight detox beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| and that might be the direction you're heading with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| We would have to consider what service we need within this facility if they were approved for that higher level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| We're certainly capable of doing that and certainly have the CSUNA facility adjacent to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| if that was something that the county wanted us to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| If the CSUNA is brought down there and co-inhabiting the same building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| what would the layout be and the liability be of having both a public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| which those beds are fully funded from the state, I believe, and are accessed by the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| They are accessed by the public at this point in time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| How would that configuration work, having non-public and public access in that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| We would work with the architects to design a very secure side of the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| and then the other side of the facility would be for the public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| That would be the best way to design that in our conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| Again, if that's not the desire of the county, we don't have to have those under the same roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| From a clinical delivery perspective, it's helpful to have those under the same roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| and that's essentially why the RFP was written the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| But again, it's a prerogative of the county for us to do that or not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| In the juvenile facility and in the detention facility and here in this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| there is a sally port door that's used for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| Does your design allow anything to where transportation will not be through the front door of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1630)|
| 0:27:20| or will it be through the front door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Law enforcement would only bring them to a single door for this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| for admission into the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| That's an architectural design, and in conversations with law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| that's the way we would like it to be delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| So there would be a single entry point and a single exit point for the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Will it be in the front, the side? I know it can't be in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| The conversations we've had are preliminary because we have not had an architect completely design the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| But the preliminary design, it would be to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| If you're facing ball camp and you're looking at the building, it would be on the right side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| which would be the least visibly intrusive, I think, for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| And you provided us with some information on three other counties that have done this and this information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| Can you tell us briefly what's different and what are the similarities in this program you all are designing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| I appreciate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| So there were a number of communities in our nation who have advanced this concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| and tailored it to each and every aspect of their community, just as we have done locally here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| So in San Antonio, they are the longest-standing jail diversion program in our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| They have over decades' worth of experience, shown tremendous outcomes in their success, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| Success being defined as they haven't had to build 1,000 new beds that they were slated to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| and all the capital that that would have cost and all the operating that that would have cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| They've actually cut in half the number of homeless people in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| While that wasn't their target, it actually became one of the outcomes of the project, somewhat of a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| In their community, they have multiple layers of jail diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| So they have what we're describing as a triage and short-term care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| And then over time, they've layered that and had some workforce development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| and homeless outreach services in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| So they did a really nice job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| And the state of Texas was so impressed by their outcomes, they've tried to add this in other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| In Phoenix and Tucson, they've elaborated on that model as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| They're more focused on the crisis end of that as opposed to the back end on the homeless and housing sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1773)|
| 0:29:40| They've done a really nice job there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Their outcomes were impressive enough that they want to extrapolate this in the state of Arizona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| Miami-Dade County did a really nice job with what would be considered misdemeanor offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| And because their outcomes were so good, they wanted to expand it to felony offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| So they've yet to do that, but that's sort of on their whiteboard, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| about how they might impact the justice system in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| So they've done a really splendid job, and I really applaud them for their preliminary data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| They've only been running for about two years, my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| So they have some work to do to demonstrate the need for felons in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| The state of Oklahoma focused their attention on mental health courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| And their outcomes were so good with that intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| that they extrapolated that to almost every county in the state of Oklahoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| And the state dollars funded that because they had such good outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| These three that you referenced, did they build facilities for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| San Antonio did build facility for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| I believe Phoenix did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Miami-Dade County did not because theirs was more court-based as well as Oklahoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| Did you check to where they located these facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| I did. It was actually interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| If you think about it, all of the facilities in Phoenix, I mean in Arizona as well as in Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| were within three-tenths of a mile to a half mile from residential facilities and areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| It was very densely populated, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| When you look at it from a satellite map, it's kind of fascinating that it is, as you might imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| these are much larger cities, but the density of residential housing next to these facilities was in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1876)|
| 0:31:24| I think Dade County located theirs in what is known as the North Shore Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| which is a complex that does have, but it's a hospital and a whole bunch of other services around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| Jerry, I know that Helen Ross McNally is a great asset to this community, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| and really all of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| I know that there are parts of Knox County that seem to do more than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| You have the detention facility out in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| They're doing their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| You have the Mission District off Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| They seem to be doing their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| This section of Western Avenue does house what I believe is your largest inpatient care facility in your system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1923)|
| 0:32:17| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| And with the addition of this, I think you'll be at a total of 83 beds, which would probably be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| would that be the largest site of in-bed patients in East Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| It may be a shortage here, but these are not inpatient beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| They're not hospital-based facility beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| These are residential care beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| So, absolutely, Peninsula Hospital would be much larger if you think about that and adjoining over the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| So there are a number of facilities here locally who congregate their beds for efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| So I don't know about comparative to what we're talking about right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Could Helen Ross McNabb make a commitment to this community to try to not grow anymore in this area within a certain distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1978)|
| 0:33:08| It's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| It's hard for us to predict what the needs of the community are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| Our response to this RFP was about the need of the community in the best location that we could identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| It certainly entertained the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| but it's hard for me to predict the future and what the needs of the community might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| It is, but seeing how this is a shared problem throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| I think shared equity within different parts of the county would be an equitable way to approach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2010)|
| 0:33:39| Anybody else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Go ahead, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Hey, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| You know, I had a meeting a month or so ago, I guess, and kind of we talked a little bit about some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| And really my concerns haven't been answered yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| You sent to MPC, you sent some questions and answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| And the only thing that I'm, there's no question I'm for a facility, but I don't want it to turn into dry dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2044)|
| 0:34:13| And when you start talking about detox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| and I understand some mentally ill people have alcohol dual diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| But currently now, you still won't answer the question of how many times somebody can show up drunk and go into your unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2064)|
| 0:34:34| and not become what dry dock was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| Dry dock was supposed to answer all of our problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| and it turned into bringing us some of our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| And so what are you going to do to prevent this from being a dry dock instead of a mental health facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| It's a fair question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| The way that we've designed the process is not to have a hard and fast rule where you've got three strikes, you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2095)|
| 0:35:02| Every person's condition dictates that you review them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| So that's the way that we'll approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Other communities who've done this kind of work in advance of us set up a process where they have representation from law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| from the district attorney's office, from the provider such as us, and usually a citizen as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| participate in reviewing cases who use the facility repetitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| So that group would meet weekly, ideally, to review cases and decide if this is the best use of community resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| So I think that's the answer that I would hope that would be acceptable for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| that those professionals who know these people, yourself being in law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| you're familiar with people who frequent the jails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| that those are the types of people who ought to decide whether or not this resource should be used more than once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| or more than twice or a couple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| And then the other way that I think we have to think about this, recovery is a process over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| and sometimes people need more than once to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| That's not uncommon for people in recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| So maybe they only get to use it twice this year, but maybe next year we give them another opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| That, again, would be up to that collective group to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Well, I think historically, and that's somewhat of an answer to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| but I don't think we're going to get an answer to the question because we don't have a policy in place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| And so we don't know what that's going to turn out to be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| Historically, when you talk about detox, back in the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| those guys were almost filling out their own paperwork to go to detox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| And so you've got eight beds set up, but mental illness is our focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| How are we taking 35 percent of the beds, 40 percent of the beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| that are not necessarily dealing with mental illness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| Well, 16 of the beds are for mental health diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Just to be very clear, that's the core package of what we're suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| People with mental illness are the target population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| We're suggesting that people who are mentally ill or other people that law enforcement come in contact with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| might need alcohol and drug treatment as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| and we have that as an option to have eight detox beds in addition to those 16 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| So a chronic PI is not necessarily going to be coming to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| I think they would be pretty quickly ruled out of being a benefit in that particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| And so let's take these and go back to these eight detox beds because I'm for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| But I think we need to ask some hard questions because I don't think all the answers are there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| A PI can go to jail tonight, check in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| and as soon as they're sober and get some paperwork signed off on, they're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| So if you take one of your detox beds, eight hours, 12 hours, they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| They don't want to be there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| What's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| The process for us is we're going to evaluate them in those first 23 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| to evaluate whether or not they're even eligible or would benefit from a detox bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| So we're not wasting those detox beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| So we have the ability to kind of evaluate people that first day that they're there, much like you just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| That evaluation will determine whether or not they're going to benefit from it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| And if they're not going to benefit from it, we're not going to waste that resource for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| I want to pause this just for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| We'll continue with the discussion here in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Commissioner Anders brings up what may turn into be a math problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| There are 16 behavioral beds, and you were discussing eight detox beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| but the eight detox beds are mentioned by the provider as an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| which I'll have to go to the law director and ask, is that a part of the contract that's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2338)|
| 0:39:07| Right now what we have is a program to renovate a building for 16 beds, is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| and then pay an operational cost for the mental illness as it relates to those 16 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| The eight detox beds, among other, there were two other alternatives to be added in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| but they're not a part of this particular contract at this time, is my understanding, the way I'm reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| Is that the way you understand it, Jerry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| And we would hope that there are other resources that down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| much like we talked about San Antonio and other communities, once you do a process like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| you will find that there are other avenues to help people and help cost savings to a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| and we'd love the opportunity to do that, and that's why we articulate it as options in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| So, in essence, if I can, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Certainly, since it was your floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| So, in essence, we're voting on a mental health facility, hoping to add a drunk tank later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| We wouldn't consider it a drunk tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| We do detox for people who have serious addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| and that process is usually about five to eight days in treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| whereas a drunk tank, as you referenced, is about one night's stay and then they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| So we're talking about a medical intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| I'm a little bit hoarse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| I'm fighting a little bit of a bug today, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| And could you move a little closer to the, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| One question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| As I was doing some research on this project, I found that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| and you hadn't mentioned this earlier when we were talking about other markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Memphis is one of the areas that we're actually, it seems like we're trying to emulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| and after doing some research on my own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| I found that Memphis is actually both not just statewide but nationally and internationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| is regarded as the benchmark for crisis intervention teams, which this is sort of based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2459)|
| 0:41:08| With that said, I've read one of their publications about training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| and the involvement of law enforcement officers making assessments out in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| to see if folks could be potentially qualified for this treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| What, I believe the Memphis team through Memphis University had said that usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| you're going to provide 40 hours of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| In fact, I think we had already said that we're already, for the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| have been providing similar training to our sheriff's department and our police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| What exact type of training is happening right now for them to recognize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| and to make those qualifications if this is somebody that's more qualified to go to jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| or if this is a mental health case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Are they getting 40 hours or do you have specific officers on duty each shift that are qualified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| This might be something for JJ to talk to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Commissioner, thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| In our proposal, you might have referenced CIT, and that is the model that Memphis really developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| which we're very proud of it because they did a really nice job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| And all over the world, not just in our country, they're replicating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| We got trained in it several years ago as a provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| and we provide the 40 hours of training to local law enforcement in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| We're actively doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| At the time the proposal was written, we had trained over 200 law enforcement officers in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| By this point in time, I think we have trained nearly 100 more to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| Now, it's all across East Tennessee, just not Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| But we do provide that training, and it's specialized to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| so that law enforcement officers know how to identify mental illness in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| differentiate how to try to get them help, and engage them in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Well, operationally, this might be a question for the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| do we have intentionality in terms of scheduling shifts to make sure that we have officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| and sheriff's deputies on duty each shift that have got this particular training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2572)|
| 0:43:00| I recognize the Honorable Sheriff of Knox County, J.J. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| J.J. Jones, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| I can't tell you the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| I can get that for you, but we have, I would say, somewhere probably 45 to 50 officers trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| I think KPD has more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| I think they probably have maybe 75 to 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| And I think the University of Memphis and their team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| they recommended it to be 20 to 25 percent of workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| And like you said, it is a state-of-the-art training for officers to recognize these people in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| And there will certainly be a multiple number of people on every shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| that will be available to recognize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| I think maybe, if I can, I'll go back to what Brad says, and we know what dry dock was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| We all remember those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| It is my goal and it is Chief Rouse's goal not for this to be a dry dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| If it turns into a dry dock, the Knox County Sheriff's Office that I can speak for will not be there any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| This is for people who are in mental crisis and have the ability to be fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| and go back into the community again and be productive citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Not a drunk tank, not a place to detox drunks that are up on the mall every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| that have been arrested hundreds of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| That's not what my intention for this program to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| My intention for this program is to help people who can be successfully put back into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| They've been there before and we know they can be helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| That's what this program is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| And if it's not, the Sheriff's Office won't be involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| And I'm not going to speak for David Rouse, but I think that's his feelings also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you, Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| One other question for Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| This is triggered by a question that Commissioner Smith had asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Are there any other buildings that are zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| He had asked a question about growth in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| I'm not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Are there any other buildings that have the right zoning for that to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| even in your all's immediate footprint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I haven't been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| I wasn't sure what the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| I'm not familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| We don't own any other property in that area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Jerry, thanks, first of all, for everything Helen Ross McNabb does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| I don't, you know, and Commissioner Smith mentioned this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| but you all have done so much for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| We're very, very fortunate to have you here, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| And I sit here and wonder, what if you hadn't even responded to the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| What would we be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| And so I think we're very fortunate that you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| A lot of the, now you and I met previously and talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| and some of these things I know the answer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| but there's a lot of people watching right now that think they're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| I just want to make sure we're clear on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| One thing, is there going to be a commitment to that, whatever community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| wherever this ends up, that this, whatever building it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| will be a welcoming type building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| It's going to fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| It's going to look nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| It's going to be, not look like an industrial building of sorts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| something that will fit into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Our intention from the beginning is to be a really good neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| and part of being a good neighbor is that it fit in to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| look attractive, be safe, be well landscaped, and be clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| and we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| We do that with every facility that we own and operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| and that is our commitment to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| We talked about coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| I think Commissioner Smith said it was only by deputy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| and that's one thing that was not clear for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| because I was thinking maybe a family member could check people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| Yes, I think when we talked several weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| I think that was an option we were thinking would be satisfactory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| but given the feedback that we've gotten from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| and conversations with law enforcement, the sheriff in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| we have all agreed the best scenario for the community is to have law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| enforcement bring them to the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| and take them from the facility to a very specific destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| Okay, and just so I'm clear, I want to make sure I know the answer to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Commissioner Andrews brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Somebody comes in there, and they've been there one night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| and they say, I don't want in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| They can opt out to go to jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| The option would be you either stay voluntarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| and participate actively in the care that we're providing, or you go to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| And will there be any education or information available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| for the people we're talking about that need this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| wherever they are on the street or wherever they may be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| Will there be any ways they can have information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| Just because people are mentally ill doesn't mean they can't make decisions on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| I need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Is there going to be information available for those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| There will be information once they come to our facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| but we're not going to actively educate the community, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| because all of the referrals will come from law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| So law enforcement will be the target audience for us to educate about what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| needs are and how to identify an appropriate person for this level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Back to the transportation issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| So once law enforcement brings them to your facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| they stay there for 72 hours and it's time to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| do they take them back to the point of where they were arrested originally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| No, I think the intention is to have a very planful discharge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| and that discharge would be to a destination that is in their best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| So it wouldn't be to the site of the crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| It might be to shelter in town if they're homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| It might be to their own living quarters if they have their independent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| Then it might be home would be their discharge plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Or it might be downtown where other folks who are let out of jail are released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| So it will be a very specific plan that that officer is following with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| discharge plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| But it won't be to the site of the crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| And then back to the facility in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Will this building house their own kitchen facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| or how are you going to feed the 31 people plus the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| Yes, this will have a full kitchen within this facility and a dining area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| We will feed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| It's a 24-7 facility, 365 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| so people are going to have to be cared for and their meals provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| And then you're going to have a laundry facility on premises or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| Yes, or a laundry service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| I think that's still to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| But generally speaking, it's more efficient for us to have laundry on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| Will you also have a special area if law enforcement brings somebody who is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| say, classified as an infectious disease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| Will you have some kind of control standards if someone comes in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| where they'll be segregated from the other 15 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| As a medical facility, we have to abide by universal precautions at all times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| and then if we have an identified communicable disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| that we would have to segregate them in the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| And it may be that they don't have the opportunity to receive care there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| because they need specialized medical attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Let's pause for just a second on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Specialized medical attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| I would read that decision being made by the law enforcement officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| or the judge that's placing them there, and this wouldn't be an option for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| I need an answer to that from law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| It would not be an option for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Under our criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Now then, let me back up on my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| I agree with Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| If someone's showing up in an ill state of health, not mental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| but with an infectious disease, would this determination be made by the officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| that it would still be a candidate for this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| I think it's going to be someone going to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| If we knew that this person had an infectious disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| they would not be a candidate for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| I mean, that's my opinion from the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| We have a facility at the detention facility to handle those types of illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Mr. Law Director, would you care to make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| and then protect us in this instance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Under the current contract, I think under the first section of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| there's an assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| And within that assessment, they look at the overall general health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| whether it's mental health or physical health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| to determine even though they're referred to Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| they may not actually reside immediately there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| They may be referred to an actual physical health center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| and not be retained there, at least as part of the RFP in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| That's the way I picked up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| And if it was determined that they had this type of disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| and once they were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| then they would be transported to the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Pardon me, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| I'm going to ask my questions going forward as they occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| You're the boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| Continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| In your e-mail to me when I was questioning the number of beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| you qualified that as 16 beds for the behavioral health center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| and then an additional 15, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Now, is what Mr. Anders is talking about eight beds part of the 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| It is not, as the law director articulated well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| And based on a 72-hour hold time with 16 beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3182)|
| 0:53:10| you're able to probably process about 1,950 patients in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| Then the other thing, in this morning's Knoxville News Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| there was an article about the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| and there was a comment that once somebody completed the 72 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| they would get to go to another facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| What is the other facility they would get to go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| And is this going to be 100% of the cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| All of the folks that we care for in this behavioral health urgent care center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| we're going to want to make sure they get connected to community resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| So when it says another facility, it's not somewhere that they will live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| but it's somewhere they'll get ongoing care and treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| So I think that's the clarification I'd want everybody to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| So there are a number of community providers in our community who we will partner with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| and that they will go and be patients of after they leave this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you for the work you do because we support the behavioral health facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| My question is in line with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| Will we track patients as they exit the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3266)|
| 0:54:34| And how will we then, when I say track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| do we track them when they exit and receive a degree of services after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| How often will they be tracked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| I mean, long-term for funding to cycle around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| what happens to people as they exit the facility and return back into the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| Or do we have to provide additional support and remediation when they return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| And at what level do we need to support them as they cycle back through the center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| One of the elements that we've included in our proposal is a case manager on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| For those of you who are not familiar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| a case manager is a professional who works with people in their own community to connect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| and coordinate them with the care that they need and receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| That includes getting housing, getting benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| and all those things that help them stay engaged in their care and treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| part of which is to make sure they take their medication too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| And so that's an element that we consider paramount in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| So we will have somebody who will follow them for some period of time when they leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| make sure they're following their appointments, help them with benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| and that's a component that we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| If they have to return to the facility for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| we reengage in that process and have somebody follow them into the community again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3353)|
| 0:56:01| As we continue with the discussion, I see second-time lights on at the current moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3361)|
| 0:56:12| Any commissioner that has not spoken so far, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| Where I'm headed to right at the moment is to say I appreciate Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3378)|
| 0:56:28| Well, just to point that we're probably going to do this exact same thing Monday night with an audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| So commissioners, I mean, we can do this tonight without an audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| but we can do it Monday night, and I'm sure there's going to be an audience here to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| And it's probably going to be saying the same thing with the same people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| if we're not voting on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| Just my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| And that was where I was headed to my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| The important thing this evening, though, is to make sure that we have every question on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| so that it can be addressed either in the contract or in discussion this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| so that we can have a vote this coming Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| I fully intend for us to seek to have an up or down vote this coming Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| I would see very little need for having continued discussion when we've had this before us for years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3441)|
| 0:57:35| Also, while I have us paused, in public forum, Tyler Crabtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3455)|
| 0:57:46| Do you wish to speak at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| And your address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| 7801 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| It's been brought to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| I've seen some of the proposals for this, and I strongly feel like it is needed within our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3482)|
| 0:58:11| Being someone who has suffered from mental illness and addiction, it is something that I see that is a good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3491)|
| 0:58:20| September 28th of 2015, I was awakened by my three sons who pounced on me and was wishing me a happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3500)|
| 0:58:29| That evening, I had no idea that my life was pretty much going to change forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| I had a chemical reaction to a medication that a psychiatrist had prescribed to me for PTSD from working on an ambulance and fire truck for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3516)|
| 0:58:47| That chemical reaction left me not knowing who my children were, who then my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| And I was basically put in Roe County's jail for three days because everybody around me thought that the jail process is what I needed in order to detox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3533)|
| 0:59:07| And that's far from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| By having this new center, the Crisis Behavior Center, I really think that you're not only saving somebody from the addiction, possible death, but you're also saving a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3552)|
| 0:59:23| You're keeping a family whole, a mom and a dad, in their home where they're not ripped away from their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| And there's just not another facility around here like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| I've tried to get help several different times, and they just don't want to lay the foundation for you to get better and for you to be whole with your family again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3574)|
| 0:59:44| Everybody wants to treat the symptoms and not the cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| And I really feel like this center would be doing that, laying down the foundation for that person and the family to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3587)|
| 0:59:58| I truly feel like it would benefit everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| Coming from me, like I said, from where I was addicted to prescription pain medication, it is needed in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3601)|
| 1:00:12| And I truly feel like you're not only saving that one person, but you're also doing a huge benefit of saving a family and keeping a family whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3612)|
| 1:00:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Thank you, Mr. Crabtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| Also, Mr. Holtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3627)|
| 1:00:41| Name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| My name is Michael Holtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| My address is 4557 Twin Pines Drive, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| I live about a mile from the proposed safety center site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| And I just want to let you know that as a neighbor, I can't wait for the doors of this facility to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3657)|
| 1:01:05| I think it's a need we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| There's an empty building that's been sitting there for several years that needs to be put back into use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3667)|
| 1:01:15| I work for the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| This is kind of an area that I work in dealing with our response to opiate addiction in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3677)|
| 1:01:25| and all of the side issues that go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| And we need to do something about this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| This seems to me to be a great start to the solution of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3694)|
| 1:01:42| Thus ends my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| We need to note that Mr. Holtz is a noted author of a recent book about fighting cancer, and it's a great story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| Thank you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Thank you, Mr. Holtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| Now then, I'll restate my comment that we need to get all of our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| Please get all your questions out today so they can be answered this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| And we will go into a second round of commission comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| Yeah, I just had a quick question for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3738)|
| 1:02:35| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| I'm great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| Hey, on the funding for this, we recognize what the state's kicking in and the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| Where is the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| We do have a proposed budget from Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| Which department will you be taking the excess dollars out to fund that budget that they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3770)|
| 1:02:59| Will that come out of the sheriff's department budget, or where are you planning to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| The budget that we have included for 18 would just come from the growth that we experienced, just natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3784)|
| 1:03:13| And so we're not really taking it from anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| What we will do is as we get in the process, and we've spoken with the sheriff about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| where we can find some savings, whether it's his budget or wherever else, we could move those savings to help fund the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3801)|
| 1:03:30| But we won't know where those savings are until we get in to that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| But for now, the funding of the $600,000 from the operational side will be strictly from natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3814)|
| 1:03:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| And Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| I'm not sure who will answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| The proposal states this in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| A community policing station will be housed on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| and an individual decides not to adhere to the sentencing of the judge to participate with services offered at the BHUCC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3843)|
| 1:04:12| and will then be transported to the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| There's been a lot of trying to understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| Are these people charged when you're picked up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| Are you arrested and charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| Where does this word sentencing come into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3867)|
| 1:04:38| General, your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| Randy Nichols, 400 Main Avenue, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| Help me again, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| Exactly what did you wish to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| It states in here that if a person decides not to adhere to the sentencing of the judge to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| they will be taken to the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| It might be a misnomer there because we have the authority in Tennessee to take somebody in for their well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3902)|
| 1:05:12| We can pick somebody up for their own well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| They don't have to make a charge at that time, it being the discretion of the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| That's what we're anticipating will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| Now, if they are charged with an offense, then we've got to follow the other parts of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| We've got to give you a hearing within 10 days if you're unable to make bond, or within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| So we've got those rules into place so we can't just sit you there and not think about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| We're anticipating basically the protective custody on the people we anticipate will be transported to this center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3942)|
| 1:05:52| We anticipate they will be in some stage of disarray, such as the trained officers that we've talked about can recognize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3952)|
| 1:06:03| We won't need to make a charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| We're still well within the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| In two or three days, the statute won't go to be months, maybe at least a year on the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| So we're not missing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| We still keep all of the authority on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| Either you accept what we're offering and you attempt to comply, or the other part comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3979)|
| 1:06:28| These people are not in control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| Those professionals that run it are the ones in control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| Okay, so if somebody's brought in, the statutes will allow you to hold charges over them until they've completed the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=3997)|
| 1:06:46| Over three days, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Jerry, can I ask you another question, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| If this contract goes through with the 16 beds and you move the 15 PSU beds down, that will fill capacity at this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4017)|
| 1:07:07| How will you backfill those beds at your other facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| We don't have a particular plan at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| but we would hope that there would be opportunity to help other people in the community who have substance abuse issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| which is what that facility does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| And what would happen if we decide we need more mental illness beds in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| and you're at your capacities at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Would you move people out of there so that we could expand our beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| That would certainly be the option, I think, if you wanted to expand this facility specifically for mental health diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| Just as it is today, you know, those 15 beds reside somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| We would have to just have a strategic plan to move those again to create more capacity if that's what the county needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4068)|
| 1:07:55| Will this facility be divided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| How will it lay out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Will there be individual rooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| Will the patients be divided by sex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| How will the interior of this thing work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Yes, there will be both genders in this facility, as you might imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| They are divided in bedrooms that are different depending on your gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| Typically, the layout for a facility like this is two-door room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| If you were trying to deal with people who were going to live there for a couple days up to 72 hours, as we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| some of the rooms will be individually kind of furnished so that some people need to be alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4109)|
| 1:08:37| and not to be in relation with other people around them during an observation period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| So they'll actually be both part of this facility by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| And how many detoxification beds do you have at your current facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| In our current facility, we have eight detox beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| And I've read your all things that have been released in the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| that there is a waiting list of up to 900 people for those beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| It is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| I think the thing to be cognizant of, the people that we treat there are indigent, folks without insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| So the only folks we get paid for with those beds are from the State of Tennessee Department of Mental Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4153)|
| 1:09:20| So they're an uninsured population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| So as you all might be quite aware, there are a number of people in our community without insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| and there's a much greater demand than there is resources for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| All right, and I guess that's what I was trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| If we have a lot of people waiting for those beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| is it right of the county to try and take those beds that would be denied to the public, just those detox beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| I don't see it as denying them to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| You're actually increasing capacity by twice as much if you were to fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| Oh, these would be six additional to the ones that you already have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| Eight additional, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| Looking at the Miami-Dade program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| And, you know, as you said, a lot of these programs, they've started a long, long time ago and have grown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| and one of these actually has a whole campus to deal with homeless to where you can actually go there and stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| kind of like a park-like setting that you can camp in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| I came across, well, I've got so much paper up here I can't keep up with it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4221)|
| 1:10:30| But Miami-Dade, thank you, sir, part of their misdemeanor jail diversion program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4230)|
| 1:10:39| and I was surprised to find that you did quote the 75% and 20% annually decrease in reoccurrence to jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4239)|
| 1:10:52| but they only had 300 referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Why was that so low?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Their pilot program was very confined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| They wanted to demonstrate its success, and as you might imagine, Miami-Dade County has a lot more people than 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| So they were trying to demonstrate their success with a small enough population to be able to manage that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| and I'm sure I don't know those people personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| I did go to a national conference where they were presenting, and like any pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| you kind of start small and then you build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| And all of these three counties that are cited here, most of them have populations of 2 million plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| and we're looking at a $5 million annual savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| Do you think that we can achieve a better efficiency rate than they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| I don't know if we can achieve a better efficiency rate, but I would hope that we can match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| It's interesting when you look at San Antonio in particular, the $5 million savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| If you look at their population, 2 million is their population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| You look at their bed capacity, it's about 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| Our capacity, we're suggesting, is about 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| So I would think it scales pretty nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| What we don't have is the campus setting around the homeless issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| We have a tremendous amount of homeless resources in this community that are doing some good work already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| And that was another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| These other programs in cities this large, I think they have more available services outside than we have here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4337)|
| 1:12:27| There's a limited amount of service, and that's part of the problem, is that a limited amount of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| Yeah, I think that's what makes this project so incredibly valuable, as one of the gentlemen was citing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| To have a resource like this for our community would just help us advance what we're able to do for our citizens that much greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4359)|
| 1:12:53| In the service agreement, it talks about renewing and cancellation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| I know who has the power on your side to renew and cancel, but it's not clear on the county side or the city side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4381)|
| 1:13:09| Will that be a commission, a mayor, a council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| Who will have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| That's a question of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| Once you implement a contract in Knox County, then it is administered by the administrative branch, which would be the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| And then if you're going to terminate one, then I'm sure it would come before this body, but he would have the option or she would have the option at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| Depending on appropriations of funds, it's like any other contract that you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| Then they operate, manage, and run that particular contract based upon what the writings say, based upon the power you've given them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4421)|
| 1:13:49| If it has a termination clause, then the mayor who is the one who executes that would have the power to terminate under the given conditions of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4429)|
| 1:14:06| The contract is a three-year contract six times renewed with a two-year combination on the end, I think, if I'm remembering correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4446)|
| 1:14:17| It comes to a 20-year contract, but it is actually three-year renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| Three-year renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| Jerry, I want to kind of follow up on what Commissioner Gill was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| I looked at some of the matrix that the other counties have used to track success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Do you all have a matrix, a system in place that will be able to track this and see the actual success rate that we're having?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| If you're referring to San Antonio in particular, they did a tremendous job creating a database, tracking individuals in all of those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4490)|
| 1:14:58| We would have to build such a system in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| One of the things we already have available is the HMIS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| I don't know if you're familiar, but there's a Homeless Management Information System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| We've been a part of it since its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Anybody who's homeless is tracked within that database already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| I believe law enforcement has a pretty good database already for people who are incarcerated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| so we would have that data readily available through law enforcement, the county, and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| We will track every person who comes through our facility, how long they stay in our facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| the kind of services they receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| To Commissioner Anders' concern, we will track the people who come here more than once and keep a track of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| so we can report back to the county and the city on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| Jerry, did you guys ever consider just adding on to your existing building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| instead of increasing your footprint within the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| We did evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| I don't know if you all are familiar with that property, but it falls off dramatically in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| When Western Avenue was redone, we actually gave some property back or technically sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| but for the price they pay, it's kind of like giving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| No, it's almost like took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| So there's nowhere in the front of our building, and the rear of the building has some space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| but then it backs up to a residential neighborhood as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| and we need space for those folks to do recreation outside of our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| So if we use that property, we would essentially eliminate that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| So it did not seem feasible to us, but we did look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| I think no matter how much you added on to that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| you would get no closer than you are to Elizabeth's place at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| I would not disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Elizabeth being our rear door neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| Yes, and on that subject, I think you have 15 foot from the rear of your building to her property line on a slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4598)|
| 1:16:46| Have you all been able to work out a way to put a significant buffer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| I actually have a scheduled appointment with Elizabeth, as you referenced her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| I have a scheduled appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| She's called to ask to meet and talk about what kind of buffer would be amenable to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| So we're going to defer to her to some degree within limits, obviously, but we've asked for her input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| Just like our neighbor to the left, Mr. Hensley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| asked for us to consider moving the entrance from DeWine to Ball Camp in MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| That was also one of their suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4640)|
| 1:17:29| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| We've been discussing a lot of things here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| and what I want to bring up here is it seems like we're getting kind of excursive here what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| First of all, you know, we're establishing a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| Second thing is we have a place that we're thinking about putting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| and we are addressing who's going to be using the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| We know it's not going to be a habitual criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| It's somebody that needs some psychological help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| The questions I want to find out going down this order to get to where we make a decision is why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4688)|
| 1:18:17| and you don't have to answer it tonight and I wouldn't want to answer it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| because it will probably be answered again or asked again at a regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| is why the three days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| Why is it so important for that 72 hours that we're doing that efficient in that three days that we can help somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4708)|
| 1:18:35| And the second big issue that I have is how is it going to affect the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| Is the building going to be intrusive in a way that it looks like a detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| or is it going to blend in like an office building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| We would like to have some sort of look how the outside of the building is going to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| and that can be brought to the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| So that's the thing I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| Why three days and how will it stabilize them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| and then from there just to kind of how it's going to spread out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| where they're going to be sent after those 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| And, again, the effect on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| We'll be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Jerry, going back to the data, you were talking about HMIS and the public information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| but I think under some other programming we have the VOCA dollars and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| There's a lot of confidentiality involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| Will this be the same, or are those folks going to sign a waiver to where the county can have access to their information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| based on their repeat, make sure we don't get repeat offenders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| Sort of the beauty of this arrangement is law enforcement is bringing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| so there's no confidentiality when they bring them to our facility, thankfully, because you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| Seeing no further discussion, Commissioner Gill, did you wish to turn your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| What's your staffing capacity going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| With regard to ratios or with regard to number of employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| With regard to ratios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| Depending on the levels of care, you have to have licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| Our licensure and state agency will require us to meet staffing ratios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| which were configured in the staffing pattern in our proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| We will meet or exceed those for the care that we will provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| Seeing no further questions before us, motion before us is to send to full commission, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4839)|

| 1:20:42| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| Item number 55, resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| It's approving a lease agreement with Helen Ross McNabb Center, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| for the lease of property located at 3343 DeWine Road for the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| Do I hear a motion of no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Since this resolution is dependent upon the one prior to it, I see no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4865)|
| 1:21:13| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4873)|

| 1:21:19| Carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| I would like to point out these are two different contracts here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| so I hope that we will discuss the lease next time, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| It will be dependent upon the other one passing, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| The line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| We do have line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Motion is properly before us to send the line item transfers with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4915)|

| 1:22:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| Motion to approve is properly before us, although they will be here to make the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4939)|

| 1:22:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4942)|

| 1:22:27| Madam Clerk, we have the added item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| Would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4950)|

| 1:22:44| Knox County on a required update to our local hazard mitigation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| Do I hear a motion to send forward, no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| Mr. Vanderveet, I see you standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| Are there questions about this for this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| Or do we sufficiently understand it enough to hold our questions until next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| When do we get the information, Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| I spoke to Daniel Sanders today, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| I'd like to think you'll have it by midweek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| He is a little bit dependent, in all fairness to Daniel, a little bit dependent on the feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| It's a complicated three-way coordination with the City's Law Director's Office and the Town of Farragut's Law Director's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| but he's working hard on it, so hopefully midweek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| Yeah, hopefully just not before, not on Monday instead of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5012)|

| 1:23:46| for being here with us and helping us with our questions and answers this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5026)|

| 1:24:00| a presentation by the Knoxville Chapters of the Embroiderers Guild of America of a hand-stitched picture of the old Knox County Courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5040)|
| 1:24:08| And that's a motion of no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| Presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5052)|

| 1:24:24| Thought you were going to get by without hearing from me today, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| Chairman Wright, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| you've all heard the expression, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| I urge you to keep that in mind when you're talking about the behavioral center that's been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5079)|
| 1:24:50| When you contract for a service, it has certain degrees of things that must come along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5090)|
| 1:24:58| To sit and nitpick whether they get red blankets or green blankets or blue needles or white needles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5098)|
| 1:25:07| is wasting your time and the public's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| What you need to be talking about are the basic elements of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| We know what reputation that Helen Ross McNabb has in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5116)|

| 1:25:31| We've been trying for eight years to get this through and get it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5131)|
| 1:25:39| Now is the time to do it or get off the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170320?start=5142)|
