| 3:19:11| worked our way through the entire agenda except for other business and public forum. I know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=11951)|
| 3:19:17| have some residents who'd like to speak to us at public forum, and I'd like to get them on as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=11957)|
| 3:19:21| as possible. As I mentioned, the other business will really just be, I've got one point to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=11961)|
| 3:19:27| about to tee up our reorganization for all of you. Obviously, I won't be there, but we'll get to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=11967)|
| 3:19:33| as soon as we go through public forum. So, and then I'm sure there'll be some announcements as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=11973)|
| 3:19:39| wrap up the meeting. So, I'll go ahead, and Mr. Link, we've got, I believe, as I look through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=11979)|
| 3:19:47| the next leg of folks who would like to speak to us at public forum, I want to remind everyone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=11987)|
| 3:19:51| it's five minutes, and after you've said your piece during public forum, you'll be out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=11991)|
| 3:19:57| meeting, and you can watch the rest of it via the link or through CTV, not in the Zoom. So, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=11997)|
| 3:20:04| next name I have on my list is Ms. Debbie Stafford. Chairman. Yeah. I have a quick question for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12004)|

| 3:20:57| different entity? Yes, sir. I would imagine that some of these people at public forum are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12057)|
| 3:21:02| be talking about the Board of Health, and it's been some time, so maybe refreshing what we stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12062)|
| 3:21:08| earlier could help. Okay. I'll go through it briefly. The Board of Health is mandated, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12068)|
| 3:21:17| mandated. The Board of Health is comprised by members whose membership is determined by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12077)|
| 3:21:24| That is, the statute states that if you have a Board of Health, and that's optional, but if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12084)|
| 3:21:32| do, it must be comprised of certain members. And those members are the mayor, the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12092)|
| 3:21:39| of schools, or his designee, two doctors, a dentist, a pharmacist, and the board, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12099)|
| 3:21:52| two separate health officers in the county, although Dr. Buchanan holds both titles, that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12112)|
| 3:21:57| the county health officer and the county health director. And optionally, the Board of Health can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12117)|
| 3:22:04| also include the veterinarian, and you all chose to do that by resolution a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12124)|
| 3:22:11| The Board of Health can also have a citizen member. You all have not chosen to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12131)|
| 3:22:16| but you could do it by resolution. What I spoke of earlier as far as removal of members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12136)|
| 3:22:24| Board of Health is that this entity does have the power under statute to remove a member for cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12144)|
| 3:22:33| but that for cause does not mean that you all disagree with their policies or disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12153)|
| 3:22:41| the science that they form their regulations on. It has to be something along the lines of fraud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12161)|

| 3:23:07| what they're doing. Is that sufficient? Yes, sir. Yes. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12187)|
| 3:23:15| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. Back on the list, I believe our first person is Ms. Debbie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12195)|

| 3:23:36| certainly move on and come back to her. The next citizen is Ms. Ma'am, I hope I pronounced it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12216)|

| 3:23:57| Absolutely. No worries. Okay. If you could just state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12237)|

| 3:24:31| this beautiful city that we live in. But my concern is what has not been addressed. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12271)|
| 3:24:37| I could just quickly read what I wrote, it's a little recap or maybe a repetition. But that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12277)|
| 3:24:42| kind of what I'm going to talk about. Okay, let me go. And the emotions are high. So bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12282)|

| 3:25:41| thus far by the Knox County Board of Health. I have no doubt in my mind that all the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12341)|
| 3:25:48| that were made were made with the intentions of protecting the citizens of the city. Unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12348)|

| 3:26:17| I experienced things that no human being should ever have to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12377)|

| 3:26:42| But in the past five months, I have realized that such experiences do not ever go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12402)|
| 3:26:49| and scars are permanent. During the forced mandates that the city has undergone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12409)|
| 3:26:55| vivid memories of government overreach in communist Romania have negatively affected me daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=12415)|

| 3:43:24| stronger than the evidence available to support their continued use. Lamy, in 2001, wrote that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13404)|
| 3:43:30| surgical face masks worn by patients during regional anesthesia did not reduce the concentration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13410)|
| 3:43:35| of airborne bacteria over the operation field in her study. Thus, they are dispensable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13415)|
| 3:43:41| Figurado, in 2001, reported that in five years of doing peri-entidal dialysis without masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13421)|
| 3:43:47| rates of peri-entitis in their unit were no different than rates in hospital where masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13427)|
| 3:43:50| were worn. I could keep going. There's at least 10 more studies that show that in OR situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13430)|
| 3:43:55| masks do not change the outcome of infection, yet we have communities, our whole Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13435)|
| 3:44:01| who are being forced to wear masks by a board that was not elected but appointed. I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13441)|
| 3:44:10| the presentation I presented, that masks do not prevent the spread of disease, will show you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13450)|
| 3:44:14| the Knox County Board of Health needs to have members removed due to malfeasance. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13454)|
| 3:44:18| you all aren't going to do that, and so I ask that you at least consider having a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13458)|
| 3:44:21| representative added to the board. Right now, we are operating off of faulty materials. There is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13461)|
| 3:44:26| massive amounts of scientific literature out there. I will email you these 15 studies that prove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13466)|
| 3:44:30| masks do not stop the spread of disease, period. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13470)|
| 3:44:35| Thank you. All right. Next is Mila. Come back on. All right. Glenn Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13475)|
| 3:44:49| Is Glenn here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13489)|
| 3:44:54| All right. Angela Holste, H-O-L-S-T-E. Is Angela here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13494)|
| 3:45:04| All right. I think the last few folks did not stick around. So, yeah. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13504)|
| 3:45:12| Chairman Knox, through a lot of public forum, I've noticed tonight specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13512)|
| 3:45:17| that there's a lot of call for a lot of people that are wanting representation from a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13517)|
| 3:45:23| side. And Law Director Sanders stated earlier that we do have the opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13523)|
| 3:45:32| I think he said it's TCA code 68-2-601, where we can, by resolution, put somebody on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13532)|
| 3:45:41| So, coming from that tonight, I think we need to start looking as a body, maybe headed in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13541)|
| 3:45:48| direction. I don't care to prepare a resolution to put on the agenda and maybe take in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13548)|
| 3:45:54| nominations or whatever. But just from hearing, I'd like to know what my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13554)|
| 3:46:02| think or if you, because that's the direction that I'm leaning after tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13562)|
| 3:46:08| Okay. Thanks, Commissioner Biggs. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13568)|
| 3:46:11| Thank you. I agree with Commissioner Biggs. We need to look at not only the citizen, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13571)|
| 3:46:17| maybe some other specialists that were mentioned tonight, epidemiologists and other ones. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13577)|
| 3:46:26| we increased this board. I guess this is for the law department, Mr. Sanders, that how many can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13586)|
| 3:46:33| add to this board? And we probably need an odd number for voting. But, you know, not only do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13593)|
| 3:46:38| I support the citizen, but I would support other specialists on there that were mentioned tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13598)|
| 3:46:44| So, thank you, Justin, for bringing that up. Shall I respond, Mr. Maestro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13604)|
| 3:46:50| Yes. Yeah. Commissioner Daley, as well-intentioned as those ideas are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13610)|
| 3:46:55| the statute only grants authority to add a citizen representative. There is no authority to grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13615)|
| 3:47:02| a psychologist or someone in a different field. The statute is very clear about what is allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13622)|
| 3:47:10| and it's the mayor, the director of schools, two medical doctors, one dentist, one pharmacist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13630)|
| 3:47:16| the health officer, a veterinarian, if you wish, and a nurse. It doesn't have a – there's no slot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13636)|
| 3:47:23| for a psychologist or some of the other specialists that the various speakers have spoken to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13643)|
| 3:47:31| But you can add a citizen by resolution if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13651)|
| 3:47:34| Chairman? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13654)|
| 3:47:39| If I were – I could put it on the form tomorrow, but the body of commission, if just by tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13659)|
| 3:47:46| could we put forth something for next month, then – and maybe, I mean, I can go work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13666)|
| 3:47:53| the law director's office to make sure that it's specifically stated the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13673)|
| 3:47:57| Well, I mean, as a commissioner, you've definitely got that right, I mean, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13677)|
| 3:48:02| meet with the law director on that. So, and then bring forth a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13682)|
| 3:48:05| I'd like to have the full support of the body, though, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13685)|
| 3:48:11| I mean, yeah. I mean, go for it. Do whatever you want to do, Mr. Biggs, or Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13691)|
| 3:48:17| knowing that, you know, you'll have a different body of commissioners in just about a week or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13697)|
| 3:48:21| that will be working on this, too. So, that would be kind of a different group that would be voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13701)|
| 3:48:25| on it. So, it's – you may – my personal opinion is you may want to start doing the homework on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13705)|
| 3:48:31| what can and can't be done, and then make sure that you try to work on that with the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13711)|
| 3:48:36| commission. But go ahead, Commissioner Jay. I'll just add that if you head down that path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13716)|
| 3:48:42| thank you, Mr. Chairman, that you might also just think through how that might happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13722)|
| 3:48:47| how might nominations come in, how might that person be selected under what circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13727)|
| 3:48:52| and when, you know, I think sitting down with both the health department, maybe the board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13732)|
| 3:48:57| the health board, and the law department, all of us would understand the mechanics of it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13737)|
| 3:49:02| be helpful before just, you know, starting. And what I would say is – and I'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13742)|
| 3:49:05| Commissioner Bussler just a second, and Scoon – is that, you know, we do have set commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13745)|
| 3:49:10| rules when we appoint people to boards. So, I think once you verify that there are rules, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13750)|
| 3:49:17| appoint a lot of different people to a lot of different committees, but I would guess that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13757)|
| 3:49:21| this type of appointment would be, if the next commission so chooses to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13761)|
| 3:49:26| would be done in a similar way. And I'm sorry, I think I'm going back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13766)|
| 3:49:30| Commissioner Bussler, then Scoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13770)|
| 3:49:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair. One thing I would like to mention, Justin, you've got Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13773)|
| 3:49:38| rather, you've got a good idea there, but we also have – we used to have what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13778)|
| 3:49:44| committee on committees that we looked at different things and make sure that we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13784)|
| 3:49:48| get into the spots we're in tonight. So, I wish we would look at that, too, when we get our next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13788)|
| 3:49:54| commission together and organize and really get the committee on committees working again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13794)|
| 3:50:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13801)|
| 3:50:02| Yep. Thanks, Commissioner Bussler. Commissioner Scoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13802)|
| 3:50:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One of the speakers this evening mentioned the suspension of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13806)|
| 3:50:12| from the Knox County Health Department, and if we still have Director Buchanan here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13812)|
| 3:50:17| maybe she could address when those services would be reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13817)|
| 3:50:23| Yeah, or how much have actually been canceled or changed. Martha, I see you're still down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13823)|
| 3:50:28| So, if you want to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13828)|
| 3:50:36| I'm not sure if she's still there. Dr. Buchanan, are you still on the – there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13836)|
| 3:50:40| Sorry, just – sorry. Yes, I'm still here. So, Commissioner Scoonmaker, our services are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13840)|
| 3:50:50| limited. We're still doing services. Actually, our WIC participation is higher than it's ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13850)|
| 3:50:55| been, to be honest with you, because it's convenient, easy, and moms like it. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13855)|
| 3:51:01| babies are still getting the nutrition they need. Moms are still getting the education they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13861)|
| 3:51:04| and participation is higher than it's ever been, honestly, which has surprised us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13864)|
| 3:51:10| And we're still seeing folks for STDs, and we're doing our Baxical vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13870)|
| 3:51:15| We've increased vaccinations for that. So, we're slowly increasing services as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13875)|
| 3:51:20| We are also – as you've seen, we had several contracts to bring on temp staff to help backfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13880)|
| 3:51:27| so that staff can return to the regular duties in all those different areas. We just hired – just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13887)|
| 3:51:35| agreed to take some grant money to hire a position to focus on overdose deaths and start that work up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13895)|
| 3:51:42| again. So, we are slowly but surely starting that work up again as staffing allows. And women are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13902)|
| 3:51:49| still getting birth control. We restarted IUDs, but then had to stop them again because of needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13909)|
| 3:51:58| related to the response. So, again, we're slowly bringing staff on and training them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13918)|
| 3:52:03| so that our other staff can go back to their regular work. I don't have a definite deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13923)|
| 3:52:10| of when we'll be able to do that because a lot of that depends on the COVID-19 response. A lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13930)|
| 3:52:15| of that depends on how quickly we can bring folks on to fill those positions and start doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13935)|
| 3:52:21| COVID work that allows my staff to return to their regular duties. I can certainly let you – keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13941)|
| 3:52:28| you guys posted on that. But we are, you know, providing limited services, including vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13948)|
| 3:52:36| We're not doing travel vaccines. That's something that we did suspend. We're not allowed traveling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13956)|
| 3:52:41| going on right now. People can still get birth and death certificates. We're still doing restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13961)|
| 3:52:46| inspections. So, we are still doing several things in a limited capacity so that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13966)|
| 3:52:53| focus on response. Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13973)|
| 3:52:57| Okay. Thank you. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13977)|
| 3:52:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13979)|
| 3:53:00| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker. Any other questions for Dr. Buchanan while we've got her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13980)|
| 3:53:05| Okay. It's hard to believe that brings us to the last item on our agenda, which is the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13985)|
| 3:53:16| business. And I thought it would be prudent just to bring up the subject of reorganization. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=13996)|
| 3:53:21| know, clearly, several of us will not be here for that. But operationally, two things to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14001)|
| 3:53:29| All right. We – it's my assumption that everybody who's going to be still on County Commission would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14009)|
| 3:53:34| like Commissioner Behler to still be part of that. I think that goes without saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14014)|
| 3:53:39| We also have our two commissioners that have been asked to stay at home. I think that ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14019)|
| 3:53:44| that – to confirm – I think it was the end of this month to confirm that. So, if things – if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14024)|
| 3:53:51| the governor doesn't extend his executive order, then the meeting will have to be in person in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14031)|
| 3:53:58| September. If the governor does extend his executive order, y'all may want to meet via Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14038)|
| 3:54:05| to make sure that Commissioner Behler's vote counts. Based on our rules, I believe, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14045)|
| 3:54:11| charter, the county clerk would actually convene the meeting and serve as chair until a new chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14051)|
| 3:54:17| is appointed. So, that chair would have to lead a meeting via Zoom because Commissioner Behler's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14057)|
| 3:54:25| not – you know, he's not – he has not – I don't know the details, but he hasn't tested negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14065)|
| 3:54:29| yet and hasn't gotten that timeline of two weeks away where he could come to an in-person meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14069)|
| 3:54:35| But I'm speaking for y'all, knowing that y'all are probably going to want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14075)|
| 3:54:38| Commissioner Behler's voice is heard at that meeting. So, you may find even, you know, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14078)|
| 3:54:44| it might behoove you to consider doing it via Zoom if the governor makes that available so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14084)|
| 3:54:49| that you can, again, include Commissioner Behler's voice. Yes, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14089)|
| 3:54:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the law department in an earlier communication said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14093)|
| 3:54:57| they anticipate that that would – that extension would be forthcoming. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14097)|
| 3:55:02| That is – well, I'll let the law director, but, you know, he said forthcoming, but we still haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14102)|
| 3:55:07| seen it yet. So, I think it's fair to sort of throw it out there just to know that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14107)|
| 3:55:11| y'all will have to consider. Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14111)|
| 3:55:14| I just think, real quick, given that that – if that is extended, that we should go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14114)|
| 3:55:20| plan on just keeping the date and the time and just – and planning on a Zoom meeting to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14120)|
| 3:55:25| to keep our order. If we push it back several weeks, that gets close to the September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14125)|
| 3:55:31| work session and commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14131)|
| 3:55:35| Chairman? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14135)|
| 3:55:36| This is David Boock. You're right. What the governor has done four times now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14136)|
| 3:55:45| the day before the expiration of an order, he puts down a new executive order extending it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14145)|
| 3:55:52| for another time, certainly. And so, I anticipate that that's what will come forth. This one wears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14152)|
| 3:56:01| out on the 29th, I believe. So, I believe that you might look for something on the 28th, sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14161)|
| 3:56:08| this week, he'll come down with a new executive order. That's my anticipation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14168)|
| 3:56:12| Well, we'll plan for either scenario. Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14172)|
| 3:56:19| I believe Dr. Buchanan has left the building. Dr. Buchanan, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14179)|
| 3:56:28| I was going to ask her what the CDC protocol is for someone that's tested positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14188)|
| 3:56:32| what the quarantine is after a negative, or if it is just a straight 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14192)|
| 3:56:39| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14199)|
| 3:56:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I got off the phone this morning with the state department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14201)|
| 3:56:45| the health department at the state level. And I asked, you know, what do you do with quarantine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14205)|
| 3:56:52| And she told me, and I've got her name, and she told me that you really had, instead of 14 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14212)|
| 3:57:00| you had 10 days. If you weren't showing any symptoms, you could pretty much go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14220)|
| 3:57:05| your regular activity because you're not showing any disease in you. So, it really is basically 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14225)|
| 3:57:12| days from the state level. That's what the state health department told us instead of the 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14232)|
| 3:57:18| I was trying to figure out if the governor doesn't extend the executive order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14238)|
| 3:57:23| and Commissioner Beeler will not be available on the 1st for an in-person meeting. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14243)|
| 3:57:30| thinking of that scenario also. Well, I would, you know, my take is we'll plan for any scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14250)|
| 3:57:37| We've got to assume the worst that, you know, we want to be ready to make sure Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14257)|
| 3:57:44| Beeler is part of this. And he may not be able to join us either way, you know, in a week or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14264)|
| 3:57:50| I mean, it's, but I just don't, that's my advice on that. Hopefully, we'll, you'll be able to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14270)|
| 3:57:55| as a, go ahead, Commissioner Smith. I think the problem is, depending on when he extends the order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14275)|
| 3:58:02| if we have time to give notice of which way we're going to go. Yep. What do you think, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14282)|
| 3:58:12| I think Commissioner Smith is right. You need to, with this meeting here, because it was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14292)|
| 3:58:18| emergency under your rules, if the chairman and the mayor agreed and there's a state of emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14298)|
| 3:58:24| which there has already been declared, then you could call, you could waive the 48-hour rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14304)|
| 3:58:31| for public notice. And that's, that's what, that's what happened, why this meeting went ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14311)|
| 3:58:36| because it came at the last minute. We talked about that, I think. Friday. Yeah. Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14316)|
| 3:58:41| late, late in the afternoon on Friday, you and the mayor and I were all together. And you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14321)|
| 3:58:49| you knew about that rule. And I informed the mayor of that rule. And we all agreed that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14329)|
| 3:58:54| one of those situations. But to get back to the question that Commissioner Smith had, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14334)|
| 3:59:01| you need, you need to make up your mind with plenty of time to give the normal notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14341)|
| 3:59:05| because this is, this is a planned meeting. It's not an emergency situation at this point. You've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14345)|
| 3:59:12| got the time. So do it and plenty of time to get the notice. Mr. Smith, you've got a question. Go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14352)|
| 3:59:17| ahead. Mr. Law Director. Yes. Could our notice include a either or option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14357)|
| 3:59:24| It was a good question. We have done that with the zoning. Either or. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14364)|
| 3:59:33| due to the circumstances, I think that's okay. But the sooner you make it available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14373)|
| 3:59:39| to the public, so that mostly for the, like you did on this one, you get somehow we got it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14379)|
| 3:59:45| the information out to all these people that wanted to come in for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14385)|
| 3:59:49| As long as you do that, I think you're in good shape. But the sooner you make the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14389)|
| 3:59:55| the better. All right. Thank you, Law Director. And Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14395)|
| 4:00:03| In following up on that, are you saying that you could essentially go ahead and schedule a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14403)|
| 4:00:08| meeting for the first, assuming, you know, with the caveat of the, if the extension is ordered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14408)|
| 4:00:15| to meet electronically? If not, then the meeting will be postponed until a future date or pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14415)|
| 4:00:21| that date? Or we could, we could notify that the meeting will take place. It will take place this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14421)|
| 4:00:25| date. It will take place either electronically or in person. Okay. That way you get your new chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14425)|
| 4:00:31| and the new leadership team in place as soon as possible to begin planning and moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14431)|
| 4:00:35| towards the next cycle. That strikes me, in my personal opinion, as the best way to do it. Go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14435)|
| 4:00:40| ahead, Commissioner Smith. Yeah. Mr. Law Director, I don't know if we could postpone it because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14440)|
| 4:00:45| would require suspending our rules. I mean, I guess we might be able to do that through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14445)|
| 4:00:53| forum. I hadn't thought of that. But you're right. Your rule says on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14453)|
| 4:01:00| September 1 or the next day. That's what your rule says. So, you'd have to suspend that rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14460)|
| 4:01:06| which you can because it's a rule. But you'd have to have a meeting to do that. You could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14466)|
| 4:01:13| have a special call meeting to do that. But that's up to you. But that's what the rule says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14473)|
| 4:01:20| It's September 1 or the day after unless the rule's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14480)|
| 4:01:24| All right. A point of clarification, and I'll get to Mr. Anders. You could have notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14484)|
| 4:01:32| and you could have, since we're still operating under electronic medium, I would think that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14492)|
| 4:01:36| Commissioner's forum would be sufficient if you needed to do something like a vote to suspend a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14496)|
| 4:01:41| rule. I think that would be in the public. But I know you can talk about it on the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14501)|
| 4:01:45| but you can't take that formal action. Okay. All right. Well, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14505)|
| 4:01:50| Yeah. Drew, in her notice, Drew has said it is possible that the special session will be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14510)|
| 4:01:56| to an electronic meeting via Zoom contingent upon extension of the Governor's Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14516)|
| 4:02:00| Orders. If the meeting is moved to Zoom, the meeting will be available to the public. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14520)|
| 4:02:03| she's done. She has put it over in the notice. Yeah. But that sounds good to me. Drew has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14523)|
| 4:02:10| the right thing there. And I think if you do it that way. Drew's always ahead of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14530)|
| 4:02:16| Hey, we talked about it a while back. So, I think we're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14536)|
| 4:02:20| Raise your hand, anybody else want to comment on this matter? Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14540)|
| 4:02:24| Go ahead, Mr. Anders. No, I have a closing statement. I don't have a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14544)|
| 4:02:29| All right. I'm wondering if we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14549)|
| 4:02:35| if the Governor doesn't extend the order, we get to September 1st and Mr. Behler is still not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14555)|
| 4:02:42| to join us. Do we just go ahead with the meeting without him? Or what can we do at that point to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14562)|
| 4:02:49| suspend our rules? Because I don't think we could do that at that meeting unless it is an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14569)|
| 4:02:55| that's on the agenda. And I don't know if our organization and meeting can have anything like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14575)|
| 4:02:59| that on the agenda. Probably not. You just have to go without Commissioner Behler. Unlike the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14579)|
| 4:03:06| school board, which statute says that if you got a sick member, he can appear. But you could only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14586)|
| 4:03:13| have one member do that. But with regard to county commission, that school board rule does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14593)|
| 4:03:20| So, you'd have to just be there without Commissioner Behler. I think it would also be fair if Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14600)|
| 4:03:27| Behler does not know he's there. Him emailing or sending a notice out of committees he would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14607)|
| 4:03:32| to serve on would not count as deliberation. So, that is one way that you could do that if he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14612)|
| 4:03:37| committees that he had a particular passion of wanting to serve on. Sure. He could put that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14617)|
| 4:03:41| the forum that he'd like to be on such and so committee. No problem with that. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14621)|
| 4:03:49| Now, I want to remind everybody that if we wind up doing a reorganization meeting by Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14629)|
| 4:03:56| that is normally a very confluted and trying meeting because it's something that only happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14636)|
| 4:04:04| once a year and has an influx of different people. Boy, you talk about a Zoom meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14644)|
| 4:04:14| But we wouldn't have to do a roll call vote. Yeah. Yeah. Commissioner Busser. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14654)|
| 4:04:21| This is very important here, too. We're saying, you know, Mr. Behler has the COVID virus and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14661)|
| 4:04:28| got things that are coming up. So, some things we might go to. But if you're at one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14668)|
| 4:04:34| meetings while you're out and someone says they have the virus and you were close to them, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14674)|
| 4:04:42| you have to quarantine when you're called that day. So, from now on out, we've got to be very careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14682)|
| 4:04:48| where we go and what we do because all that has to say is, well, Mr. Smith, you were at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14688)|
| 4:04:57| meeting and there was somebody there and you were close within that seven minutes and they will call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14697)|
| 4:05:02| you and let you know that you can't be there on September the 1st. You have to quarantine. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14702)|
| 4:05:09| whatever we're doing, if you've got meetings and things that are coming up that you were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14709)|
| 4:05:12| go to, you better watch. Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14712)|
| 4:05:20| I just want to add, just because you're somewhere and someone may have it, they have to put you on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14720)|
| 4:05:27| the contact list. And it's still kind of unclear since everybody was wearing masks last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14727)|

| 4:05:45| person. And preferably that would be when no one's wearing masks and around. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14745)|
| 4:05:55| Okay. I'll be clear. I think we've got some direction to move on this. And Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14755)|
| 4:06:00| Dale, I'll let you make one closing comment and then we can wrap this whole four years up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14760)|

| 4:06:16| during the Commissioner's orientation. It was brought up that our growth plan needs to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14776)|
| 4:06:22| back on track because our sector plans are so far out of date. Well, mine is anyway. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14782)|
| 4:06:27| this new commission coming up, we need to start back on the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14787)|

| 4:06:45| Yeah, I just wanted to, you know, it's been a long time. Twelve years is a long time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14805)|
| 4:06:49| a lot's going on. But I think there's a lot of people in the room that seldom get recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14809)|
| 4:06:54| or don't get recognized enough. And, you know, Drew and, of course, Jolie before her and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14814)|
| 4:06:59| Sharon just come into the office. A tremendous amount of work. I mean, the chaos that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14819)|
| 4:07:05| on TV is one thing. But with the chaos they deal with us, you know, 11 people getting us together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14825)|
| 4:07:13| and getting us everything we need. And they've done a great job. And Angie and Kim in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14833)|

| 4:07:24| the minutes is very meticulous. And what they do is great. And I don't think we recognize them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14844)|
| 4:07:31| enough. And I just wanted to say how, well, what big of an honor it is. And, you know, if we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14851)|
| 4:07:36| to come back, I want to talk about all the department heads that have been right beside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14856)|

| 4:07:45| their team have done a great job. And I don't think we recognize them enough. And I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14865)|
| 4:07:49| tell them I appreciate all the work they do. Yeah, absolutely, Brad. It's been a pleasure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14869)|
| 4:07:56| work with them and all of my friends here. I think as I mentioned, you know, we're going to walk out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14876)|

| 4:08:19| it. So, it was kind of funny. So, you know, a couple of final words that are meaningful, I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14899)|
| 4:08:26| want to say, you know, as you, Rick Ashley, you know, the guy who's the singer, you know, he used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14906)|

| 4:08:42| And I heard that Rick Ashley had a collection of Pixar movies that I could borrow from him and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14922)|
| 4:08:46| maybe even buy. So, he agreed. And I went over to finally get all my Pixar movies from him. He gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14926)|
| 4:08:53| them all to me, except for one, because he said that he was never going to give me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14933)|

| 4:09:11| I feel like I should, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14951)|

| 4:09:26| really bad joke to go out on. And that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14966)|
| 4:09:29| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14969)|

| 4:09:41| able to work with two different mayors. And he won't be here all night. So, it's been a humble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14981)|
| 4:09:48| privilege to work with so many of you and so many team members that we've all overlapped with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14988)|
| 4:09:53| So, too many names to say. So, I'll be quiet and we can go around the room if you want. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=14993)|

| 4:10:13| It's very typical of Brad to point out other people on his way out. He's done a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15013)|
| 4:10:20| of service. What I'd really like to hear Brad do is list every commissioner he's ever served with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15020)|
| 4:10:28| The tick flame will be closed before we get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15028)|

| 4:10:39| Thank you. I've got to take a shot at somebody anyway. If you notice, Carson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15039)|
| 4:10:44| when you're looking on the film here, he's got a halo around his head. So, when you look at Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15044)|
| 4:10:49| he's in the dark. He goes to the dark side by leaving us. And so, I had to take that shot at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15049)|
| 4:10:56| you. And I want to say it was good to sit beside you. Well, you were commissioner. You were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15056)|
| 4:11:02| chairman sometimes. So, I didn't get to sit beside of you, which was the best days. But anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15062)|
| 4:11:08| and also the age thing the other day, I noticed that you were getting on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15068)|
| 4:11:14| what we're doing today, a little bit slower. So, the age must be catching up with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15074)|
| 4:11:20| And I hope your next thing that they have access for handicapped for you so you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15080)|
| 4:11:24| get in and out your offices. So, it was good seeing you there. And I had to take a shot at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15084)|
| 4:11:31| the chairman because he let me go by without getting voted down. So, I had to take a shot at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15091)|
| 4:11:37| him. And Evelyn, what can I say? They say, if you can't say anything good to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15097)|
| 4:11:46| don't say anything at all. Okay. But anyway, let's go. Who else is leaving? Evelyn, it was fun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15106)|
| 4:11:53| being with you on commission. It was fun gigging you every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15113)|

| 4:12:08| If I do say it, I'm in trouble because it's on live news. So, anyway, you all have a great day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15128)|
| 4:12:14| and a great future. Thank you all. Thanks, Commissioner. And I think, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200824?start=15134)|
