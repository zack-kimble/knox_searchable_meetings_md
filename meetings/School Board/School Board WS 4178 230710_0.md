| 0:04:43| And just a reminder to those in attendance tonight that our public meetings are the only opportunity the board has to discuss items that come before us as an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=283)|
| 0:04:54| And we're glad you chose to attend, but please note the elevated noise makes it difficult for us to hear each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=294)|
| 0:05:02| and sometimes it makes it difficult for you all to hear what we are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| So if you do need to speak to your neighbor or something, we ask that you step outside to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=305)|

| 0:05:22| And with that, changes to the agenda as discussed in executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=322)|

| 0:06:05| Yes, ma'am, we do. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| At this time, I'd like to recognize someone very special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Ms. Ronnie Chandler has served public education and higher education for 45 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| and has served as the executive director of Project Grad since 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| On June 30th, Ms. Chandler officially retired, and we want to publicly thank her tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| Before she comes to the podium to be recognized by the board, I'd like to make a few brief comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| My first would be Ronnie and I first met each other years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| It's been a few years, Ronnie, hasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| But I was a young principal and assistant principal at Fulton High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| and had the opportunity to become familiar with Project Grad, actually serve on Project Grad's board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| And along with Jerry Hodges and Ronnie at that point, Ronnie moved on to take that over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| And just impressed early on as a principal, just her heart for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| And I've seen her in many situations, and she's always consistent, a lady of integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| who's always asking about more opportunities for students and what is it she can do to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| It's always been real easy to work with and try to make those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| And has just been a great friend through the years as we've partnered in the work, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| A few weeks ago, I was able to hear her news toward the end of her tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| I was able to sit by her at Austin East graduation and just listen to her give that commencement speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| And very inspiring to the students who were there as a former roadrunner herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| And just really to be able to call them out and challenge them and just create possibilities of what they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| And I think she's a great example of that, and I just really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| I do want to talk a little bit about some of her accomplishments that some of you may not have known over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| So she's made a tremendous difference in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=467)|

| 0:08:21| Employer-paid high school internships to give our students opportunities in the summers to make money but also to be exposed to careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| And a summer TCAT trade and technical program initiative and an advanced manufacturing opportunity with IACMI composites called America's Cutting Edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=508)|
| 0:08:39| She's led Project GRAD summer institutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| If you have not seen those or been part of those, it's a great opportunity for students who wouldn't have that opportunity to go stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| either Pellissippi or UT, and to spend time on that campus to acclimate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=528)|

| 0:12:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=775)|

| 0:12:58| Our district summer learning, a few brief announcements today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| Our district summer learning camps finished on June the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| And I want to say thank you to everyone who made that such a huge success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| As you know, there was a strong focus for summer learning this year because of the new third grade retention law that passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| This did present some additional challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| But our principals and district leaders did a tremendous job of working with families to help them understand the impact of this new law and to get them enrolled in the summer camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=796)|
| 0:13:25| In addition to our teachers and educators continue to provide high quality instruction throughout the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| And we really think this is going to help our students as they begin the 23-24 school year, especially in that third grade and fourth grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| So thanks to everyone who's helped with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Speaking of the upcoming school year, you'll see it kind of, I think, on our whole staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| We feel like we're back today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| This week feels like it's live again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| So speaking of the upcoming school year, I want to say thank you to our district principals who have been working hard to get ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| And I want to welcome back our assistant principals who will return to the buildings tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| These school leaders are critical for our mission, and we're grateful for all of their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| I'm also very excited that more than 400 teachers will be participating in our new teacher academy later this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| This is a great opportunity for educators who are starting their careers, who are getting a fresh start in Knox County, to learn about what makes our district so special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=848)|
| 0:14:16| And we're very excited to welcome them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| Finally, I'm pleased to announce that Knox County Schools has received an important recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| Earlier this year, we were named a finalist for the U.S. Department of Defense's Employer Support Freedom Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| which highlights employers that provide support to National Guard and Reserve employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| I'm very happy to report that KCS is one of the 15 organizations that will receive this Freedom Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| This is a great honor and reflects our strong commitment to the men and women who serve our country while also serving students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| If you would, please join me in expressing our gratitude to the Guard and Reserve employees who are part of the KCS family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=892)|
| 0:15:00| Madam Chair, that concludes my report for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you. I think this next item is yours as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| Dr. Rice, I should just let you keep the interim report on student success review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| All right. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| We at this at this time, so so I'll say this real quick while we have I'm thinking is Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| You kicking this one. OK, good. I was making sure it was you, not Corey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| So this has been a great process for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| As you know, we've been in the process of a deep dive into our student success and reviewing just our practices, policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| And you saw some of that from some action you all took last month in the change of practitioner partners that have come in out of this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| We have a little more information, a deeper dive into that, that that review is not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| And so, Mr. Myers and some other folks are going to come share where we are in that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=949)|
| 0:15:59| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board, Superintendent Risewick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| As Dr. Isaac said, this is really an interim report based on the information we've been able to gather so far in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=962)|
| 0:16:10| To echo what Dr. Isaac has said, it has been a really meaningful process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| I think that we've been able to learn a lot about sort of what our inner workings are in our in the division of student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| And I think to to continually pursue improvement, we have to understand those inner workings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| So I think this process has been has been really meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| So back in February, Superintendent Risewick announced a thorough review or deep dive into our policies, procedures and practices in the division of student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=990)|
| 0:16:39| Specifically focusing on RTI, special education and ELL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| Our district, as well as the division of student success, are committed to the pursuit of continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| And we do believe that this review will provide us with important feedback as we continue that pursuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| To help us execute this project, we partnered with the division of strategy to help us develop a framework for stakeholder engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1017)|
| 0:17:07| and to gather input from families whose students qualify for services in RTI, ELL and special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| So I'm going to let Corey come up to talk a little bit about the framework that we used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1034)|
| 0:17:28| We have two more speakers after me, so you all get a bit of a revolving door with this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| There's a lot of hands on deck for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| So as you heard from Mr. Myers, the student success deep dive is a pretty expansive process that touches three different departments and a variety of workflows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1054)|
| 0:17:47| And so when we sat down to think about what the pacing of this work needed to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| we really needed to keep in mind that we wanted to build a framework that would not only provide time for sufficient stakeholder engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1072)|
| 0:18:01| and input from all of the families that we wanted to touch and reach out to as part of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| but also that we built a framework that allowed for iterative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| So it allowed for Mr. Myers and his team to take action in response to and to begin making changes in response to everything that we learned over the course of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1093)|
| 0:18:25| So the framework you see on the screen in front of you is that framework that we developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| And as you can see, there are three independent work streams that contribute to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| So in the green, you can see our response to intervention work stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| In the yellow, our special education work stream that includes 504s and IEPs and the ELL work stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1119)|
| 0:18:47| And so if you look at those first two columns, the winter and the spring columns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| you can see that for all three of these areas, we really followed the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| That process began with family surveys that were sent out in the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| They progressed into family focus group sessions in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| And then we really began to diverge based on the needs of each of these focus areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| So that divergence took place in the spring, beginning with special education and ELL, the educator input portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| So we'll tell you a little bit more about that in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| And then it progressed into the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| So if you look at the summer column, you can really see where we start to differentiate our approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| In the summer column for response to intervention, you can see that we're scheduled for a report on next steps for RTI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| So you'll hear that from Ms. Jones here in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| And I won't really say much more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| But then you can see for special education, we're currently in the midst of engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| So stakeholder engagement is still ongoing for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| As many of you know, we have already convened a special education task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| That group is currently meeting and is going to continue to meet over the course of the summer with the intent of generating some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1193)|
| 0:20:02| and some kind of key findings to share with the Student Success Division and to share with the board in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| Once that report has been made, Mr. Myers and his team will compile that report and take a look at all the various sources of input that have been received over the course of this deep dive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1209)|
| 0:20:19| And then you'll hear a little bit more about their next steps in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| As we move into ELL, one of the things that we knew going into this work was that engaging with multilingual families was going to require an added layer of coordination and intentionality and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1223)|
| 0:20:36| And so that's represented here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| So you can see over the course of the summer and the fall, kind of early fall months, we've set aside some time to be really clear on what that planning was going to entail and how we were going to proceed with a deeper engagement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1238)|
| 0:20:51| So that work will take place in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| And then just like the first two work streams, you'll hear from Mr. Myers and his team around sort of some of those next steps in the ELL space as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| So that is the framework that we're operating out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| And that was a very long way of explaining one slide, but we'll continue to kind of circle back around as we proceed through each of those three work streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1264)|
| 0:21:13| And I said on this framework that we've already conducted some stakeholder engagement to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| So we've got family surveys, family focus groups, and educator input survey data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| And we're going to go through two of those sources of input at a very high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| And then we're going to let you guys spend some time really digging into what we learned in those family focus group sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| So to go very quickly over both our family surveys and our educator input portal data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| And board members, I'll let you all know in front of you at your seats, you have a full report on both the family surveys and the educator input portal data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1302)|
| 0:21:50| which is why we're not going to spend as much time on that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| We're going to leave a little bit more time for our friends from Ackerman to tell us about the family focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| But just to go very briefly through those family surveys, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| We received about 1,000 responses to the surveys that were sent out in the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| And you can see what the breakdown of those responses was based on each survey category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| We received a little over 550 to RTI, a little over 200 to ELL, and just shy of 400 responses to special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1335)|
| 0:22:25| And these family surveys were very high level surveys that were really just intended to provide kind of an initial baseline analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| an initial capture of the parent and caregiver experience as it relates to RTI, special education, and ELL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| And the idea there was that this could be then provided to each of our subsequent areas of engagement and focus as kind of a jumping off point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1360)|
| 0:22:49| So this was intended to be, again, very high level and something that would create an opportunity for us to dig in a little deeper at every subsequent engagement point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1369)|
| 0:23:00| So in the report that you all have, you have some key findings that go above and beyond what's pictured on this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| What I chose to feature on this slide were the three areas in which we had the highest concentration of disagreement from participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1387)|
| 0:23:16| So the way the family focus groups were set up, families were given a series of statements that they had an opportunity to either agree with, disagree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1396)|
| 0:23:26| strongly agree with, or strongly disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| And then we generated some findings based on each of those responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| So what you see here in orange are the combined percent of respondents who either disagreed or strongly disagreed with each of those italicized statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1415)|
| 0:23:47| And then in the blue, you see kind of some of those key findings that were derived from those responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| So those are our assumptions based on what we see in the responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| So one of those initial assumptions was that families are relatively unsure of where to find additional information regarding student success services and supports on the KCS website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1437)|
| 0:24:09| So automatically, we know that there's some work that we can do in making our website a more user friendly and a more intentional tool for families who are wanting to access information on services and supports and interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1449)|
| 0:24:23| One of the next findings that arose from our family survey was that there's room to improve in our ongoing communication with families regarding their students' progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1463)|
| 0:24:34| So we know we can do a better job in that space as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| And then one of the last findings came out of this last italicized statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| So the last italicized statement was my school or Knox County Schools uses innovative approaches to meet students' needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| So we saw a pretty high concentration of disagreement in response to that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| What we're not sure of is whether that means we're not using the most innovative approaches to meet students' needs or if we're just not communicating very well what we're currently doing in that innovative space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1494)|
| 0:25:05| And so this is one example where we do need to dig in a little bit more deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| And this is one of the reasons that these survey findings have been provided to a couple of different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| So in addition to providing them to you all and to Mr. Myers and to his team, we also provided the survey findings with a couple of different groups, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1514)|
| 0:25:24| We provided them to Ackerman to serve as a jumping off point for the development of their focus group questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| And we have also, I believe, provided them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| We have definitely provided them to the special education task force as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| So they're going to continue to dig in, and we will do the same with our ELL engagement as that work progresses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| I'm trying to go kind of quickly here because I know we've got a lot of slides to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| I think I only have two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| So the educator input portal, just like the family surveys, was an open opportunity for not our families but for our educators to provide some insight to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1553)|
| 0:26:04| and to provide us with a jumping off point for thinking about whether or not there's more we can do in the special education and the ELL space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| So on the screen, you'll see the staff categories of staff recipients who received access to each of these two portals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| and staff members who chose to take advantage of this input portal opportunity had three weeks to log on and to provide anonymous feedback through the input portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1580)|
| 0:26:31| And that was specific to two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| So every respondent was asked two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| They were asked whether there's any innovative strategies, supports, or practices that they were aware of that we're not currently using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1597)|
| 0:26:45| So what could we be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| What more could we be doing to improve outcomes for students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| And they were also asked what approaches to existing strategies, so what are we currently doing, that we could do better or that we could leverage at a greater extent to benefit or improve student outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1609)|
| 0:27:01| So those are those two questions that are going to anchor the responses that we'll go through in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| And before I progress to the responses, I did just want to call out the participant numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| So we received 187 responses to the special education portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| And we received 43 responses to the ELL portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| All right, so that means we received a lot of open-ended responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| And we had to digest them and compile them in some way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| So the special education portal generated a lot of varied responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| We did not see a lot of cohesion or consistency among the responses that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| But we did see a lot of passion from our educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| So on the screen, you see kind of a heat map, so to speak, of the major themes that emerged in response to that educator input portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1664)|
| 0:27:53| The larger the circle and the darker the circle, the higher the concentration of responses was to that kind of thematic category of response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1673)|
| 0:28:02| You can also see the numbers under each of those thematic categories is the number of responses that fell into kind of that theme or that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1682)|
| 0:28:12| The highest concentration of responses to the special education input portal really centered on curriculum selection and usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1692)|
| 0:28:21| And so these were educators who, by and large, were requesting more alignment between the special education curriculum that was being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1701)|
| 0:28:31| and the general education curriculum that was being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| There were also, again, some variance in terms of how curriculum was being implemented and whether or not we were using technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| Some educators felt that we were overusing technology in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| Some felt we were underusing technology in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| So again, there was a lot of difference there and some variance there to dig into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| But those were all responses that kind of centered around curriculum selection and usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Practices and protocols was the second highest concentration of responses to this particular portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1736)|
| 0:29:05| And those were pretty varied in and of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| That was almost a catch-all category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| So that category largely pertained to any existing or potential changes to existing systems to better meet students' needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1750)|
| 0:29:22| So that's pretty broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| But some of the themes that emerged within that particular category included increasing opportunities for shared planning time between special education and general education teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1763)|
| 0:29:34| increasing the number of district-level facilitators or mentors to provide additional support to teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| and rethinking master schedules to allow for more time in small group instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| So again, you can see that even within kind of these higher concentration categories, we still received a pretty high degree of variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1786)|
| 0:29:54| And I won't go, again, too in-depth, but the report that you all have in front of you does explore some of those major themes a little bit more thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1794)|
| 0:30:02| And for the sake of time, I'm going to hop over here to the ELL input portal responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| And as you can see, while we did receive fewer responses to this particular portal, the responses we received were less varied in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| So there was more cohesion in response to this survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| The highest concentration of responses here really centered around staff supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| And so that included everything from staff wanting to feel more included at their schools to wanting more opportunities for collaboration with their broader school communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1830)|
| 0:30:41| and requests of more direct coaching support from their facilitators that support them on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1841)|
| 0:30:50| The student supports category largely pertained to the ways in which individual schools tailor their supports to meet individual student needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1850)|
| 0:31:00| So this included everything from modified classes for students with limited or interrupted education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| to having onsite interpreters to help students who are learning English better navigate the school environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| The third highest concentration of responses was curriculum usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1874)|
| 0:31:23| Again, this emerged here, but it emerged in a slightly different way here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| So this was actually a more varied subset than the rest as far as ELL goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| The request here was to explore additional programs or types of curricula that could better benefit students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| but there wasn't a lot of cohesion between individual responses in terms of which program or what curriculum was being suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| And then family supports largely focused on looking for more opportunities for schools to better engage families in supporting both their students and themselves in supporting students along their educational journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1907)|
| 0:32:03| And the majority of those responses centered around requests for additional or increased interpretation or translation services at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1923)|
| 0:32:14| And the final category, class size, there is exactly what you think it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| And so those were responses that requested that we look into finding ways to lower class sizes to provide for more individualized learning environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1939)|
| 0:32:31| For students with very different needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| And so I'm going to take a deep breath and pause because I just covered probably 60 pages worth of information, about five slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1953)|
| 0:32:41| But we have some really great visitors here with us today that I want you all to have an opportunity to hear from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| And again, know that each of the surveys that was covered today is really just considered kind of foundation building and is intended to be provided as one source of input that is built upon over the course of this engagement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1971)|
| 0:33:05| You're going to continue to hear these themes iterated again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| This won't be the last time that you hear this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| So with that, I'm going to turn it over to, I think, Chris and Bethany both from Ackerman Marketing and PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| And they're going to tell you a little bit about what they learned over the course of this family focus group sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=1999)|
| 0:33:31| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| So we moved into the qualitative process and we introduced the topic in different settings, different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2012)|
| 0:33:45| So we were charged with identifying whether parents and guardians of students receiving special education services feel informed and supported, feel included in their student's educational journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2025)|
| 0:33:58| And feel their students are benefiting from the specialized services they're receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| Our methodology, we did evening sessions over the first two weeks of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| There were separate groups for each of the three groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| They were held at Fulton High School, Central High School, Carnes, and Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| And then we also did one virtual session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| All the participants were recruited by KCS staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| In total, we had 40 parents participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| The key themes, number one, communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| It's either too noisy or radio silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Or somewhere in the middle, it was really interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| So out of this, there appeared to be a need for singular points of communication, less noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| Because so much comes in so many different ways that there was confusion as to what even to pay attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2084)|
| 0:34:53| So there needs to be consistent, frequent, and clear communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| And this was true with all three groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Currently, there are too many ways to communicate with parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| And it's really left to the discretion of those who are doing the communication outbound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| And so whatever they're comfortable with, however they want to do it, is what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| But the problem is, as students move through the process, different teachers from different grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| just from grade to grade, school to school, and throughout the system, there's no consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| It happens in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| You've already heard the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| We can reiterate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| The website is either unknown, hard to navigate, or it's missing information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| So currently, in its current state, it's ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| The ESL-EL parents always need to be able to understand any communication from the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| no matter the form of the communication or the setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| So things should be available in English and Spanish, or available in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2152)|
| 0:36:00| So many times, the parents said they were relying on either the student to help them understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| or other parents that might help them if they found such a mentor to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| SPED and RTI parents desire more than just an occasional update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| Again, some inconsistency there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| They express the need for more in-depth communication with greater consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| Sometimes they just felt there was cursory response or cursory communication, if it existed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| Those same parents need more information at the onset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| So there was many expressed going into the process, not fully understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| They also did recognize that someone may have had the opportunity to chat with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| and talk with them, to really lay out what that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| But they might not have been in the state to hear exactly what that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| and it was never communicated again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| So they're unsure of what it looks like for their child going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| and what that means to the child and to the parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| Theme number two, accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| There is a need to remove the complexity, need to set standards of performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| and holding them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| When I say them, it's both staff as well as parents and teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| and parents and students, and hold them accountable at the highest level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| Set realistic goals, and report cards with teacher and team accountability for achieving those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| Often the students, we were told, are on track, and they hear it all through the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| they're on track, but then right at the end, with maybe weeks to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| they hear, oh, student's not going to achieve that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| And they felt that why didn't they hear their progress wasn't being made earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| than basically too late to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| So parents are frustrated and confused over a perceived lack of rigor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| when it comes to regular evaluation of goal progress and attainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| And then suggest that they hold the student accountable to do the hard work and achieve results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| not just doing things to check a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| We heard often that students may have been given just some very simple task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| that didn't seem to be part of any lesson plan or goal plan, just to keep busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2294)|
| 0:38:22| Number three, consistency across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| Kind of alluded to this a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| There's a desire for consistent communication, commitment of the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| and application of the intent of any of the three services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| Again, there are sparks of greatness and no sparks at other levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| just inconsistent across the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Significant differences are present in each school, from teacher to teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| grade to grade, and difference from school to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| School creates angst as children move through the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| advancing from elementary to middle to high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| The lack of clarity and consistency allows parents to develop mismanaged expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| related to how progress and activities should be administered intellectually and logistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2345)|
| 0:39:14| Number four, parent engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| A little different maybe to harness, but in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| they've suggested harness and leverage the power of passionate parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| And we did talk to some very passionate parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Tap their desire to fully engage to provide the appropriate level of support needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| to help the academic team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Need for centralized hub for parental support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| A place for parents to go and get resources to support their child from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| A place to seek out information related to the services that are available to their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| or that they already are receiving, and contact information for support in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| key dates, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| We did hear some tell us they had no idea who to contact about their student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| Maybe they say, well, we might try the teacher, and we might get a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| We just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| But in this case, they suggested just a hub where if the parent can help their child at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| where do they go to where it would be consistent and something not made up or just off the cuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| that is consistent with standards for that student to progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| And empower the parents to be advocates for their kids in partnership with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| Team number five, trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| There's a feeling of deep distrust, especially with the SPED and RTI parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| General feeling that they appreciate the opportunity to share their voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| even through the focus groups and surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| but were highly skeptical that anything would really change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| A lack of trust between some parents and the district, school leadership, and teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| less often the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Many comments reflected the belief that those involved in their child's EIP meetings were just checking a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| We've just got to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Let's move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| Many parents commented they felt they were the only ones truly advocating for their child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| All parents want to know that there is at least one adult in the child's school truly in their corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| and invested in their child's success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| We did hear great stories of parents and their children who felt they did have this in their schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| from a principal to a teacher that were just with them all the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| even as the child progressed, they would still check on that student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| and just make that extra effort, and others that appeared, well, didn't have that same level of passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2494)|
| 0:41:43| Theme number six, empathy, from all, for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| Parents expressed that they want teachers, administrators, and support staff to treat their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| in a way that they would want someone to treat their own child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| There was also an expression of empathy from parents for teachers and support staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| a perception of exhausted staff with too few resources, which can be perceived as numbing their passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2523)|
| 0:42:12| So out of that, we came up with some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| Improved communication strategies, website update, you've already talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| centralized communication through one sanctioned app or website across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| We say, perhaps, parent square, I mean, you've got it, but it's not always used consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| And offer training to teachers who aren't confident in using the approved platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| A welcome video or class packet of information, could all be digital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| with parents, when their child enters SPED, RTI, or ESL programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| to help manage expectations and empower the parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Perform a communications audit to evaluate the types of communication parents are currently receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| and how to streamline and align that communication across the district to meet the parent's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| And then ensure all communications are presented available in English and Spanish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| with the ability to access translation and interpretation services for other languages as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| Professional development training for teachers, administrators, support staff on topics like enhanced parent experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| strategies to support SPED students in general education classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| Best practices for teachers, school, and parent communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| And create consistent processes, systems, and communication for parents and students in SPED, RTI, and ESL| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| across schools and in grades in the same school, so that parents have a consistent experience with their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| as they progress through all the grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Collaborative change process with teachers and administrators for SPED, RTI, and ESL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| Include teachers, administrators, and support staff in any changes so they feel they have a voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| which will create buy-in and make the execution of changes easier for teachers to implement and to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2641)|
| 0:44:10| Develop resource portals that could provide the best material that can be tapped by parents, teachers, and subs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| Staff and therapists to a single app that's available in multiple languages and is used uniformly by everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2658)|
| 0:44:27| Establish or promote, if they already exist, parent groups that can help other parents navigate the complexities of the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2667)|
| 0:44:35| and the challenges each parent and child faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| And then this last thought really kind of summed up much of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| This is a quote from one of the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| I truly believe that if everyone viewed all children with disabilities, ESL, and RTI needs as their own child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| and were willing to work together to ensure their success, to brainstorm ways to help these kids improve, we would all be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| This includes communication, accommodations, and adding staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| I turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| So as you all can see, we've been reviewing quite a bit of information over the last little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| So I'm grateful to Chris and the Ackerman team for their support through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| and helping us kind of work through this qualitative data that presents a big challenge to process that much information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| So they're greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| As Corey mentioned during her part, this is still an ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| This was, again, intended to be sort of an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| So the upcoming next steps is that the Board of Ed will get updated from the Special Ed Task Force in the August meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| followed by a report out from the Special Ed Department in our September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| And then we will continue to work to engage more deeply with our EL families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| At this point, to tell you all a little bit more about some of the work that's going to be going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| and moving forward in the intervention space in the next school year, I'm going to bring Alicia Jones up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| She's our Director of Student Supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2767)|
| 0:46:16| Madam Chair, members of the Board, Superintendent Reiswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| thank you so much for this opportunity to share next steps for RTI Squared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| In starting to talk about interventions, we want to focus on the KCS priority excellence in foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2788)|
| 0:46:38| We know that opportunities for interventions and tutoring, it accelerates the learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| and it ensures that students have success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| And so with that, our vision for interventions for the 23-24 school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| is to ensure that all students have access to research-based academic interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| that includes tutoring and the response to intervention that is aligned to specific skill deficits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2821)|
| 0:47:09| as identified by a universal screener and other diagnostic assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| And so for the year 23-24, tutoring will move from the academics division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| into the student success division under the student supports department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| And this will give us the opportunity to provide a response to instruction and intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2847)|
| 0:47:37| When we talk about alignment of interventions under the Department of Student Supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| the KCS intervention model that creates that alignment with all interventions provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| that builds a cohesive academic support system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| It includes tutoring as the structure for small group instruction beyond core literacy and instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| And it includes RTI Squared as the process to guide that change in student academic support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2881)|
| 0:48:09| So with moving tutoring to the student supports department out of academics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| it gives us the opportunity to align all of these interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| and to utilize our entire portfolio of support for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| And because tutoring is allowing the learning acceleration and remediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| through the high-quality instructional materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| it's extended beyond that core academic instruction with RTI guiding that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| And we know that intervention starts with the Tier 1 supports and Tier 1 instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| So this will be implemented the same as it is now in terms of our universal screener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| We will still continue to provide the universal screener three times per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| That information will be reviewed along with other data sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| and this will allow the students to be placed in the interventions that will best meet their specific needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| These resources will be aligned to ensure the students are in the right intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| And we've met with principals to design a schedule that extends the core extension time by 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| which gives us a 45-minute intervention block starting out in Region 5 for 23-24 school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2968)|
| 0:49:37| with the plan to expand to all schools in the following years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| And our RTI-squared facilitators will continue to support schools in each region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| to build their capacity in analyzing their student data and their school-level data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| and that will convert into actionable steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| We will also have increased support by our academic interventionists that will lead interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| that will include tutoring in 10 of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| The board approved intervention materials in the RTI-squared budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| and that is to decrease the number of students who are scoring below the 40th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| And we will also use a data tracker to ensure the alignment and the compliance of the use of the interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3025)|
| 0:50:36| We just recently completed an RFP for interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| and that will help us to create fidelity, consistency across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| It will also give us the opportunity to explore additional contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| to align the student's skill gaps with the most appropriate interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3051)|
| 0:50:59| Our long-term goals by year 2028,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| we expect that at least 70% of students in kindergarten through third grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| will score above the 40th percentile on the Aimsweb universal screener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| We also expect that 85% of students in the fourth through eighth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| will meet or exceed their TVAS growth projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| And one of the things that we just heard from the Ackerman's report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| is that our parents want more engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| and so we will do a deep dive with our website to include family learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| We want to add parental resources to the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| and provide additional more frequent communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| And at this time, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3110)|
| 0:52:02| So does anyone have any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| It's a lot to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| It really is, but it's an important discussion to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| and I'm glad that the work's being put into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| and look forward to seeing that continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3141)|
| 0:52:33| I just want to say real quick, thanks to the folks at Ackerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| I know when we said we were going to do a deep dive into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| we were serious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| I think you've seen from the amount of documentation and input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| and things that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| but I think that's added a great approach for us to actually be able to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| straight from parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| And I think for us it was great that it wasn't us on the other end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| asking the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| I think we heard a lot of feedback, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| to have someone that they could trust and have that third party to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| to ask those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| So I think that's given us some really good feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| I think there are some great themes from this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| from both what Corey was pulling out and what you all's work was, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| some very tangible things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| But, again, let me just remind everybody it's not over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| as Jason said a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| There's still work for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| But this work is going to be hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| It's not going to be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| When you talk about communication, that sounds like, oh, great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| that should be no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| But we hear a depth of communication there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| We hear websites, one thing, for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| But you also talk about each interaction with a human at a school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| and or in an IEP meeting and all of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| that's a lot of shifting and a lot of things that have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| So we'll continue to identify things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| And I know there's still a couple months, as Corey laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| of how all this will come through and what we'll work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| and then assess that off of in the coming months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| and years to make sure we're getting better at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| But, obviously, there's a lot of room for us to improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| a lot of great stuff going on, Jason, in your department, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| So I want to make sure we say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| But, you know, we're really adopted a continuous improvement mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| as an organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| and I really applaud our staff that they're willing to take those looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| because it would be easy not to and say, well, we're compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| but we're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| We want to be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| We want to be the best at serving our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| and give our students the best opportunity to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| So I appreciate everybody who's been involved up until now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| and look forward to what we have for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Thank you, Dr. Oswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Dr. Weiser, just to echo those comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| from a board member's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| I really appreciate the continuous improvement mindset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| I mean, you know, we've all been in spaces in our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| where that's not been the mindset, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| and often there's high levels of frustrations in those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| But there can also be frustration when you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| in that continuous improvement mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| because sometimes we do grow comfortable in the right world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| and because it's sometimes just easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| And I appreciate us as a district being willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| to take the hard look and appreciate, Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| you and your team doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| and the partners that we've had in that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| Also really appreciate the attention to engage our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| and our educators through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| I did have just one question, and it was back with Corey's slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| I'm curious, what was the thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| around not having the educator input portal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| for the RTI work specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| Yeah, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| You know, Mr. Myers may want to add a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| but really RTI is such an all-inclusive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| that that was going to be a really wide net| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| that we would need to cast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| and we wanted to hone in on specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| like, what are those core concentrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| that we can kind of dig into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| And my understanding is RTI is also a little bit more prescribed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| and prescriptive than maybe the other two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| and so there's maybe just not as much room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| for flexibility in that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| but I'll see if you want to add anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| to that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| No, I think you captured it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| I mean, the RTI space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| we leverage many different classes of employee in doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| so it does require you to engage with more folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| And then to echo what she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| the programs are prescriptive, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| So there's not a ton of room for innovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| within those programs as much in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| do we just get more programs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| And so that was really the key part of the discussion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| Yeah, I'm wondering if there's a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| to get some educator input in the sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| whenever you have something that's prescribed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| even though you can't be really innovative with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| there's also the question of fidelity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| Like, how well are we doing the thing as it is prescribed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| So I'm just curious if there's opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| to get feedback on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| But just, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| Thanks for all the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| All right, so any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Okay, so we will move into discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| of our regular session agenda for July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3430)|
| 0:57:23| Sorry, let me get my, so much stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| Lots of papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| I know, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| All right, so the consent agenda, 6A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3453)|
| 0:57:49| C, items and contracts, 1 or 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| Mr. Dupour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| On number 1, I just wanted to explain a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| I've worked with Lucas Arnold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| who is the attorney for Mr. Huff on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| This is an existing easement that was there for a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| adjacent to the campus at Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| It is, I believe it's Mr. Huff's intent to operate a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| and improve the parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| And this went through Dr. Adams' department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| And there was, I think the consensus was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| it's certainly not harming the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| and it would be a benefit to Mr. Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| And I think Mr. Triplett was involved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| So I just wanted to explain a little bit more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| And if anybody has anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| And I think Mr. Arnold is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| So he's here if you all have any other more specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| Thank you, Mr. Dupour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Ms. Helen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| To help me understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| I'm going to put it in the most simplistic terms I think I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| It looks to me from looking at it from like a Google Earth perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| that we are using part of his yard right now as kind of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| and turnaround and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| And if I understand this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| this is simply an agreement for when he turns it into a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| that we could continue doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| So it's my understanding he'll be utilizing that parking lot for his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| So we would not continue doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| We would not be using that parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| So it doesn't look like we need that space anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| Thank you, Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| So any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| So what about C2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| Items 4 or 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Sorry, I actually missed 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| I have a similar question about 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| It looks to me like this is an agreement with ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| Since we are the provider and we are the do I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| Sort of an agreement with a division of ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| Ms. Semergard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| it's an agreement between Knox County Schools and the Knox County Schools EPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| And these are required by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| even though it looks kind of weird like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| occasionally we have MOUs between the county and Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| Again, it looks funny, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| there's reasoning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| 3 or 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| I had a question for Mr. Dugler on number 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| It looks like you have not signed this form of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Can you just talk about this agreement a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Yes, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Thank you, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| And I think you and I spoke briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| I mean, I think not only 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| but I think you had a question about 8 and 9 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| But I can certainly focus on 4 at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| So this is something that Brian Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| District Athletic Director, has been working on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| And, yeah, he's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| and he can answer some more specific questions if you all have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| It's my understanding that, you know, the high schools particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| and then some other middle schools perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| but the high schools in our district all use this huddle technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| It's a camera system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| but it's also a statistical data system that's used for various sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| you know, so it crosses all, you know, sexes and sports, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3737)|
| 1:02:25| from football, volleyball, you name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| And the schools are using it in varying degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| Some of them are using it quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| Some of them not quite as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| But the problem is that we didn't have a set agreement with huddle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| and Agile Sports Technologies is the actual company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| but, I mean, they go by huddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| And we needed something in place so that our schools could use the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| and that they were all on the same playing field, to use a bad pun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| So we got these agreements from huddle for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| I didn't sign it because it's not in the Knox County preferred format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| but at the same time it's not in a form that I would necessarily object to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| So the board is certainly welcome to sign off on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| This is, again, this is a plan to get the district through this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| Next year we would like to get more preferred language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| and make it even more accessible and, you know, available to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| So that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Mr. Brown, would you like to, I see you standing there, add anything to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| So it is a software technology and evaluation tool that 13 high schools are using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| Like he said, some very extensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| Six, to be exact, have cameras set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| but another six would jump on this tomorrow or Friday after the board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3841)|
| 1:04:09| to improve their services with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| It's something that's been going on for actually two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| trying to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| So do you have any questions about the services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| Well, that's what I would just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| So it's already been in use and it's been going well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| and so you've been happy with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| Is there any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| So item five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| Six or seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| And item eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Mr. Dufour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| And again, Ms. Horne had questions about eight and nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| Again, so these are, we've seen these before, particularly from MTI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| Music Theater International.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| They don't agree to our preferred terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| but then we usually come down on some terms that are more what I would call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| And so my office can't sign off on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| but the board often approves these types of things to provide this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| to the students involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| But the students and parents involved just need to understand that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| aren't preferred terms and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| do these types of things at your own risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| And item nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| You said that was a similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| So any other discussion on those items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Mr. Dufour, do we need to have parents and students sign any kind of waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| I mean, it's my understanding that we're already doing that, that we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| when this is similar to particularly nine to a field trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| So parents and students should be signing off on a release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| Items 10 or 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3989)|
| 1:06:37| Going to board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| So I'm looking at number 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| the request for South Dole to purchase and install a sound system in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| school's auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| My question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| why is this at a cost to the chorus booster club rather than a cost to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| It seems like a sound system in the auditorium should be a capital expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Basically, when we do look at this on the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| that's something that we would add to the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| This is something that was a donation that they wanted to do for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| And so we could certainly look at that for the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| But from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| this was a donation that they wanted to get done and expedite the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| I believe this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| I think that was part of the issue is if when you add it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| then you get on that list and it's desperately needed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| and they did have a pretty generous donation come through for specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| So moving on to board policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| a seven B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4075)|
| 1:08:06| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| E seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| Looking at E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| this is the one that we are changing to job descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| My concern with this is that what we have in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| Let me find it first so I can make sure I'm saying the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| So I'm looking at E and it is policy one 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| What we initially had in this policy is really two policies that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| joined into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| And when we remove this language and adjust this language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| we're ending up with only one of the two policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| We're ending up with the job descriptions policy very clearly here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| but we are losing the administrative and supervisory positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| The whole policy basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| We are required to keep records of policies that we rescind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4156)|
| 1:09:23| And I'm wondering how we will show that this is a rescinded policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| Because that's really what's happening here is we are rescinding a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| policy by removing this half of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| So is there some way that this will be able to be shown as a rescinded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4181)|
| 1:09:52| In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| it might behoove us to split this into two first and then do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4193)|
| 1:10:04| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Do you have any thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4205)|
| 1:10:15| I mean, the board, if the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| Agrees that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4220)|
| 1:10:30| Now I'd have to, I'd have to take, take a further look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| But I mean, if it is indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| What Miss Owen is describing then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| Then the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| May better serve the board to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| Combination and deletion of some language or something of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| So say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| We're talking about E, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| Like, like emotion when, when it's approved or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| So it's already been approved once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| I mean, you know, this is a second reading, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| but what I understand Miss Owen's question is that she just wants the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| record to be accurate as to what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| happening with the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| So certainly that, I mean, that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| I mean, that, you know, if there's, if there's a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| A deletion of, of a former policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| And where it's combined here, then it, then it could say recension or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| you know, whatever it needs to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| But that could be done when the motions made with the correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| At the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| So the reason I asked this question and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| There's a recent statutory change that brought this to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4307)|
| 1:11:54| Where we used to be required to keep all of these in the school libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| And we were required to keep records of all of the rescinded policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| I believe in our school libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| We are now just required to have them available in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| So that is why I question how this will be shown as a rescinded policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| I think if we don't show it as a rescinded policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| it comes back to that trust issue that we've already had once this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| It's just changing all of the language around and pulling out one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| It's almost hidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Basically it's a subversive way to rescind a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| So I think there needs to be some way to show that we have rescinded this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| policy on administrative and supervisory positions and qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| We haven't just changed some language to call it job descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| In most policy handbooks, these are two completely different policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| And I think I haven't done this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| But I think if we went back and looked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| we would find that this was initially two policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| It was joined together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| And what we are doing is essentially rescinding one of them and keeping the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Ms. Coatney, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Ms. Owen is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| So normally when the board rescinds a policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| I would keep a record in the board office of that policy that was rescinded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| and it would be deleted from the policy manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| The way that this one is being done is we would actually take policy C-132,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| change it to descriptor code G-181.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| It would remain in the policy manual in the G section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| But C-132 would have not been rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| So it would show up a little bit different in the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| It would, however, remain attached to the everlasting electronic agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| if anybody needed to go back to see how that footprint happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| That helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| I mean, to me, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| Because we're changing the descriptor code, it's really jumping in the manual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| which to Ms. Owen's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| makes it look like it wasn't something that was actually rescinded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| but it was actually something that was just moved and substantively changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| So it's like the former policy kind of disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Mr. Duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Yes, based on this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| I'd recommend that the Board come back on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| and just modify the language to make it more accurate for the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| Just in the motion itself, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| I'm not talking about going into the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| I'm just talking about for the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| Just as a matter of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| So is there any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| Moving on to item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| G or H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4514)|
| 1:15:22| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| I have some questions regarding H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| which is course credit earned outside of the base high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| So there's the language that we talked about last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| I'm not seeing that it's been substantially changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| Also, last time I asked if we could see a copy of the policy from another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| county that does this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| And I don't think we've seen that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| So that's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| At the bottom of I-122, we have added language in line 36 that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| the same procedures for evaluation of acceptance of any new course shall be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| The reason that is problematic is because in the state board rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| there are very specific procedures for acceptance of a new course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| And those procedures require that each special course approved by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| department shall be recommended to the state board for an approval period of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| one, three, or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| So that is the first piece that's problematic with this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| The second piece is that the legislature has been very clear that the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| procedure for evaluation and acceptance of this course should not at all be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4604)|
| 1:16:51| same as the procedures for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| They've been very clear that there should be no expenditure of state funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| There should be no tax dollars expended in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| So there should be no staff time expended in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| The assessment very clearly is supposed to be done by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4628)|
| 1:17:17| And we could look at this language and we could say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| maybe that's not really what they intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| But I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| I was there for multiple meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| And in every one of those legislative sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| it was massively clear that they expect the Board of Education to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| It was said over and over, it was said in multiple meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| they expect the Board of Education to approve the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| It was specifically asked of the bill sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| will the Board of Education approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| And he said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| So for us to so blatantly go against the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4672)|
| 1:18:01| that seems, it seems like a sure way to cause a student to go through a course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4681)|
| 1:18:09| and not get credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| The other piece I have, well, I have multiple concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| I have another concern regarding the language that says we will have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4694)|
| 1:18:22| certified instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| The law says that the instructor doesn't have to be certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| If we want to say that we are going to have a certified instructor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| that that's the only way we will award credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| I think that can be part of our assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| But I'm not sure we can actually require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| And if we do require it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| what would be the appropriate licensure for that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4730)|
| 1:19:03| Does anyone know what the appropriate licensure would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| Because, right, Tennessee State certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| So if we're talking about a religious moral instruction course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| the way I'm reading this, since I'm certified to teach high school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| I would be more qualified to teach this than Reverend Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| and that seems wrong in every possible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| So I don't think we can say that we are going to require a certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| if we don't know what the certification would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| It says with the relevant endorsement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| but it doesn't say what that endorsement should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| what the certification should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| The last problem that I see on this page is that it says principal permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| shall be granted if the course is approved by KCS curriculum supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| Curriculum supervisors are nowhere in this law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| and it may take me a second to find it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| but I believe it very clearly says that the principal has the authority to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| Oh, that's for excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| It says that, let me back up to the licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| Instructors of release time courses are not required to be licensed or certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| pursuant to Chapter 5 of this title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| Instructors and other employees of the release time courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| shall be hired by the independent entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| It says that release time courses shall coincide with school class schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| So if we have curriculum supervisors who have approved a course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| and that course does not coincide with the school class schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| this policy requires the principal to somehow grant permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| and that's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4872)|
| 1:21:24| Dr. Wilson, did you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| Yeah, I think the only pieces I would add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| and Gary may have more to talk to to that effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| as I read the law, when we move towards the Board of Education approving the credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| is when the requirement for the licensure may be included in the Board's review of the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4898)|
| 1:21:46| So the secular criteria may include, and one of those items is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| the licensure status of the teacher pursuant to Article 5 or Chapter 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| Again, it would seem from how that's written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| that that would be the option of the Board to include that in the criteria of whether or not we would include it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| and to your point, because we're talking about a course likely that it falls outside of the regular offerings of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| it would be dependent upon the Board's assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| of whether this licensure is the adequate one for that course that's been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| There is the case, or the chance, Mr. Dupler and I talked about that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| that a course that got approved could fall under a more generic elective code at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| which we have broad categories in English and in social studies that provide for multiple types of courses to fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| Again, there is a case that it could fall under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| That would be up to the state to decide, I would assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| and again, we're on the very, very front end of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| trying to imagine what that process to go through would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| and I think, again, going back to your question about the same procedures for the evaluation acceptance of any new course shall be followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4972)|
| 1:22:59| we were looking at that more as when we bring a course that is not in the state catalog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| so it is a special course developed by our supervisors, our teachers that work together on those courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| that those in their final form before being approved by the state come back to the Board for consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| and so not to say anything about the spending of money or time or anything like that on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| but just that there is a process by which, right now, courses do come to the Board that don't exist in the state catalog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| and this would be another example of how that might be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| Thank you, Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| I think it's, so the issue here is that we have nothing in this policy that says anything about it coming back to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5018)|
| 1:23:48| The law says that's what's required, but the policy doesn't have that anywhere here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| and if we're looking at whatever the regular course is, that's certainly unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5033)|
| 1:24:06| I don't see anything here that assures me that that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| We're also supposed to be approving the credit, so it's not just the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| We're supposed to approve this credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| and we're looking at a credit that a student could potentially take every year or even every semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5062)|
| 1:24:30| A student could end up with eight credits impacting their GPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| and essentially impacting how our GPAs look coming from Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5076)|
| 1:24:49| and we have requirements that we aren't defining at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| When we're looking at relevant endorsements, I would expect us to know what those endorsements are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| before we consider approving a policy to give credit in a course that the policy doesn't match the law for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5103)|
| 1:25:16| I think this seriously needed to go through policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| and match the language to the law so that our students end up with the course credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5121)|
| 1:25:29| that they think they're going to get going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| So I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| One part of the discussion we've had, I'm still not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| I'm not quite understanding the terminology of Tennessee State Certified Teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5143)|
| 1:25:52| So what does that term, Tennessee State Certified Teacher, mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5152)|
| 1:26:01| Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| As written here in the broadest sense, I would assume that means that they have a teaching license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| that is active in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| So whoever brings that course for approval, whoever teaches that course has to be certified by the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5169)|
| 1:26:23| prior to that being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| And then the second thing that I had the concern about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5187)|
| 1:26:34| and Ms. Horne, I did see an email that you sent to someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| and it talked about three things that needed to be done was parental permission for student participation has been given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5199)|
| 1:26:49| program instruction takes place off school grounds, and no government funding is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| And I don't see that in this policy stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| And I think if that's the case, we need to state that in the policy, if that's what's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| And that was just a question to me when I saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| The third thing I had a question about, the law that we're speaking to, we have to have a policy for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5232)|
| 1:27:20| That is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| So we have to have a policy for this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| And so I'm not trying to argue the law, but I do think one of the concerns I have is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5246)|
| 1:27:34| and since I've been on the board, we've had a lot of discussion about what things we think our kids should get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| and what things we think our kids shouldn't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| And I know this is one of those things that when a parent approves it, the parent is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| I'm deciding what's best for my kid and what's not, and I'm good for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| But that means that whoever brings a course, as long as it fits this criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5273)|
| 1:28:04| it doesn't matter what, quote, religion, end of quote, that they're bringing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5284)|
| 1:28:10| they have the right to bring it, no matter what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| And so being a pastor, I would like to think that I would bring something that everybody would like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5295)|
| 1:28:22| But I've been around long enough and studied religion enough to know that everybody doesn't agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| And so I may not agree with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| But with this, I think we need to make sure that we have a policy that's going to hold the test of just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5310)|
| 1:28:39| people just can't bring anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| Now, of course, once again, parents have, I think it's very important that parents' permission is in the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5321)|
| 1:28:50| so that sometimes someone can bring something that looks good to our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| but as parents, we know it's not good for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| And so those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5339)|
| 1:29:06| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| Well, Reverend Butler, a couple of the things that you mentioned, the three pieces that would be in an MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5349)|
| 1:29:17| if an entity wanted to establish some sort of off-campus class, they would bring us an MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| So it's not part of this policy because this policy is simply regarding credit, them receiving credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5365)|
| 1:29:32| So I think those things would be addressed in an MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| So if an entity wanted to offer a class, they would present the board with an MOU that talked about parental consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5376)|
| 1:29:44| that it would be held off-site, and whatever, I can't remember what the other thing was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5384)|
| 1:29:52| No government funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| No government funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| So I think that those, my assumption would be that those would be in the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| and I don't know, we could get Mr. Dupler's opinion on whether it needs to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| but in this particular policy, it's just about accepting credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| So that's what this policy is, and so I don't think it would necessarily be appropriate for it here because of this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5410)|
| 1:30:19| To Ms. Owen's point, my understanding was that it did need to be a certified teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| If it does not need to be a certified teacher, then I think we need to take that off, because I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| I think if that is not specified in the law, then we need to change that so that it matches the law, no doubt at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5430)|
| 1:30:39| My assumption, and I don't know enough about the process, Dr. Wilson would have to weigh in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| regarding the school system, basically the school system would not be approving the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5446)|
| 1:30:55| So the school system would simply be going through whatever process is needed so that we have a course code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5455)|
| 1:31:04| so that there could be communication between the school system and the state so that the student gets credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5464)|
| 1:31:10| So whatever that minimal process would be, that's my assumption on the involvement that it would be for KCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5470)|
| 1:31:19| because we would not be approving curriculum, that just wouldn't be our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5479)|
| 1:31:28| So it would be simply in whatever the course code is to communicate that to the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| So if we need language that says that more succinctly, then we certainly need to make sure that that's communicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5493)|
| 1:31:42| So that is my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| May I speak to that, Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| And I hear you, I'm only reading that it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| to decide whether one elective credit may be awarded for the student's completion of a release time course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| Knox County Schools curriculum supervisors are to evaluate the course neutrally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| without any test for religious content or denomination affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| The same procedures for evaluation and acceptance of any new course shall be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| The secular curriculum criteria utilized to evaluate the release time course is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| So it sounds like they are evaluating the course, as I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5548)|
| 1:32:36| And so I could be interpreting it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| And that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| That's why I said I still have a question, because I'm not trying to re-argue the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| I'm just saying that it sounds like we are being asked, or someone is going to evaluate the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| The way it reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| Mr. Dupour, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| So, I mean, the law does say that the Board of Education shall evaluate the course in a neutral manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| that does not involve any test for religious content or denominational affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| So, yes, there has to be some type of evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| The way the policy is set up is so that the Board doesn't have to do all that on its own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5596)|
| 1:33:25| that, you know, the administration can't assist with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| but then the Board would then sign off on it at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| just like the Board signs off on any new course that's offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| As far as the certified teacher, that is also in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| It says, whether the course was taught by an instructor licensed pursuant to Chapter 5 of this title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| What's it referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| TCA 49, Chapter 5, which deals with teacher and principal licensure in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5628)|
| 1:33:57| So it has to be a certified teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| According to Chapter 5 of 49, some type of teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| Now, I'm not saying that, you know, it has to be a particular type of teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| I'm just saying 49, Chapter 5, deals with teachers, licensure, and principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5650)|
| 1:34:17| And let me say one other thing that Ms. Horne had said, and I understand about the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| but one of the things I think with this policy, I believe it has the potential for controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5663)|
| 1:34:31| And one of the things I've always believed with anything that has the potential for controversy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| you try to minimize the controversy by being consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| So if we want to have an MOU that reflects certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| I think we need to put in a policy that every MOU has to have these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| Otherwise, you know, sometimes we may have an MOU that have one thing and some have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| So I think we need to be consistent and say what an applicant or whoever applies for a course to be approved need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5693)|
| 1:35:03| so that everybody's on the same, it speaks clearly what you have to bring in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| Because as soon as we say no to someone, I'm sorry, we say yes to someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| as soon as they say no to someone else, then there's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| And I'm not contesting what Reverend Butler is saying, but I mean, you know, let me clarify this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| because this law can be confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| There's really two separate parts to this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| One is that, you know, that you can have a release time course, particularly at the elementary level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| and this board doesn't have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| It can happen as long as the course meets the requirements of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| And I believe Ms. Owens is looking at Section E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| Well, Section E, that applies to what I'm talking about right now, this elementary version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| If you're going to have a course for high school credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| then the law makes a distinction that you have to have a teaching license to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| Ms. Wharton, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| Sure. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| Reverend Butler, I feel like it would be beneficial to add in here just that it would happen off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5769)|
| 1:36:15| So I think I'll make a motion on Thursday to add that language, that it would happen off-site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| if you think that would be appropriate, Mr. Duplo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| I mean, to your point, that would add clarification and make sure that everybody's on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| And then my second comment would just be back to the teacher certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| just so that everybody's on the same page on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| The entity would be choosing that educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| It would not be the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| It would be the entity, just so that everybody is clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| Can you also add parent approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5804)|
| 1:36:52| Because it talks about principal approval, but it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| And I think it's key that we understand that if anyone sends their child to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5815)|
| 1:37:02| that they're not going to expect that that child is going to be joining something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| that the parent hasn't had a chance to look at and consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| I think this is a good discussion, and I do think we need to have as much clarity as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| In 2019, before I was on the board, there was an opportunity for the board to pass a religious release time policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| in that field at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| And a lot of what was in that policy was clarifying some of these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| that don't have to do specifically with the credit, but how the course is offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| that it be off-site, that it not involve any financing from the school, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| And so I think that's where some districts may not have the challenge in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| because they, like Campbell County right here, has a policy about this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| So they have two policies that are really trying to do something that we're trying to have one policy to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| So I think that's part of some of the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| I know I've asked this question every time we brought it up, and I thought it was resolved in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| and then Ms. Owen brought the issue up again, and it's still not clear to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| I'm hoping that the law does not intend that every semester a student in high school could go do a release time course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5894)|
| 1:38:23| and get a credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| I'm hoping that's not the intention, that it's one credit ever in your high school career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| But this policy is not clear related to that, because like the way I can read line 34| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| is to decide whether one elective credit, meaning not two, not three, not four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| elective credits for a release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| But if I do more than one release time course, does that mean I can get a credit every time I do one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| If it's a different one, obviously you can't get a credit for the same course if you do it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| But if you did more than one, could you get multiple ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| And I don't know what the intent of the law is in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| Mr. Dupler, I don't know if you can speak to the intent of that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| And then regardless of whether or not the intent of the law is, what's our intent to communicate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| Is our intent to communicate that you can get one high school credit total for a release time course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| or that you could get multiple ones depending on how many release time courses you take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5953)|
| 1:39:20| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| Mr. Dupler, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Thank you, Madam Chair, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| The law is just not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| You know, I mean, that's the honest answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| You know, it certainly doesn't specify one during your high school career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| So, I mean, the best way to read it at present is that if a course is accepted for a credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5976)|
| 1:39:45| then a student could take that course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| If there's more than one course, that's different to your point, not a repeat of the same course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| but if there's more than one course, then, you know, a student could possibly get a credit for taking multiple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| a credit for each multiple, for each separate course that that student takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| So then that brings me back to Ms. Owen's point about if a student were to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| and it reflects in a GPA and things like that, what message does that send?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| And not that those courses aren't valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| I'm not saying they're valuable or not valuable, but even if the law is not clear on the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6021)|
| 1:40:28| could the board be specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| Could the board limit in our policy that you can get up to one total credit over the course of your high school career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6030)|
| 1:40:38| as a release time course, or do we not have that capability to limit it to one, two, three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| or whatever we want to do as opposed to somebody just getting eight and really boosting their GPA that way or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6043)|
| 1:40:54| Mr. McMillan, I don't think you've spoken on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| In reference to what you were saying, Mr. Watson, I think the board could limit it, put any restrictions they wished on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6061)|
| 1:41:17| as far as getting credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| You know, they wouldn't even have to give, you know, much credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6081)|
| 1:41:30| They would get some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| But I guess, Mr. Dupler, since the principal can change a grade or give a grade, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6092)|
| 1:41:52| If they did that and nobody challenged it, would it be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6112)|
| 1:42:07| I don't understand what you're asking, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| I mean, are you talking about the teacher awarding the grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| No, I'm not talking about the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| I'm talking about the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| Now, the principal could talk to the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| But the principal has authority over that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6142)|
| 1:42:30| And as such, they would have authority to set a grade if they so chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6150)|
| 1:42:46| All this other stuff, I think you're, maybe I don't understand it, but I think we're trying to make it too complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6166)|
| 1:42:57| If the principal set a grade or changed a grade, and unless somebody objected to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6177)|
| 1:43:10| it wouldn't have to come to the board, would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| I mean, the law doesn't really talk about grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| It talks about whether or not the board is going to approve the course as being available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| It does not mention the grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| Well, if the principal approved the course, he would, as principal, he would have to be involved in approving the course or they wouldn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6208)|
| 1:43:41| When it doesn't say that you can't, then, you know, I would take it that you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6221)|
| 1:43:52| And pertaining to what Mr. Watson was saying, you know, you can take it as many times as you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6232)|
| 1:44:04| but you're only going to get one credit for it or a half credit, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6244)|
| 1:44:12| You're not going to use it to boost your GPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6252)|
| 1:44:20| It's not designed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| I mean, yeah, one credit would be the max that the board could offer for each particular course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6264)|
| 1:44:30| I mean, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| And the whole thing about the principal, I mean, you know, to me that's a little bit deceiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| I mean, again, if you're looking at the section of the law that talks about a principal, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6277)|
| 1:44:44| these release time courses can operate, again, as long as they're outside of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| And really the principal has the decision on where, when, better said, when that occurs during the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6290)|
| 1:45:01| I mean, that's what a principal has to decide is, is when in the school day would this fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| because it cannot conflict with tested courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| What do you think they would offer it if the principal said, no, I don't want to fool with this, we're just going to squelch it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6311)|
| 1:45:22| I think that's the intent of the policy language is to say if the board approves this as a course for credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6322)|
| 1:45:29| a principal can't then say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| So last time we discussed this, I asked if we had looked at a policy from another county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6342)|
| 1:45:49| and I may have misunderstood the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| I thought that we had looked at a similar policy in another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| Have we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| So the only policy that I could find is in Campbell County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| and it's the release time religious instruction policy 6.2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6364)|
| 1:46:11| And it is specific to the general release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| It doesn't mention anything about the actual credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| So I feel like we're getting things backwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6381)|
| 1:46:28| because we're putting the credit in before we're putting the course in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| and I think that's where part of the confusion is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| I have yet to see a policy anywhere that is actually awarding the credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6398)|
| 1:46:47| and I think it might be really helpful to us if we could see anywhere that has a workable policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6407)|
| 1:46:54| where they are actually awarding the credit so that we could at least make some comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| to see what's going on, if one even exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6419)|
| 1:47:12| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| Just a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Since this has been approved on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| and Ms. Horns suggested that she may ask for approval with some other additions to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6438)|
| 1:47:26| or changes on Thursday, does that mean that's first reading again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| or can you make changes in a second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| Mr. Duport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| I think it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| The changes can be made, you know, as long as the main emphasis of the policy doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6462)|
| 1:47:51| So, I mean, is there a gray area there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| I mean, if you're changing whole sections, then you may want to call it first reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| But if you're adding and clarifying, then I think the board could legitimately say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| hey, this is second reading, and we're just making it more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| In light of that, on line 32, I may offer up the suggestion on Thursday that we also add a line that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6489)|
| 1:48:17| something to the effect of a student may receive up to one total credit for a release time course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6497)|
| 1:48:24| over the course of their high school career or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6504)|
| 1:48:31| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| So, okay, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| I have a few notes here, but I'm not sure I'll remember everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| Ms. Owen, the Campbell County release time policy, I also looked for it and did not find a specific policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6522)|
| 1:48:50| but I know that they have been offering this for some time for credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| Prior to this becoming one credit, it was offered at half a credit by state law, and they have been utilizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| So I don't know where their policy is, but they've been actually doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6543)|
| 1:49:10| So, Mr. Watson, I understand your thought on one total credit per transcript, but I could not support one credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6550)|
| 1:49:22| The way release time works, it is such that students can take advantage of release time really any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6562)|
| 1:49:31| So, obviously, if you have a high school student, they have to have a certain number of credits to be able to graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6571)|
| 1:49:37| So, with that taken into account, I think that the schedule, since we're on block scheduling for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6577)|
| 1:49:45| you would be able to take more than one credit in your high school career and still meet the qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6585)|
| 1:49:55| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| I mean, it's very difficult, since there's not clarification in the law, what our role in that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| So, I think that's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| It would be nice if the law had stated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| I know in Campbell County, there are three classes that that learning center is offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6611)|
| 1:50:18| So, this entity that I've spoken with, they are looking at really mirroring that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| So, I'm assuming that this entity would like three, to offer three classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| I'm told that typically students usually take two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| They typically don't take all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| So, you know, if we, if Mr. Dupler would need to weigh in on whether you think we could add in a limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6634)|
| 1:50:43| but I would not, I would think we would want to make that at least three, if we're able to add in a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6643)|
| 1:50:51| But bottom line, I mean, kids can take advantage of release time, whether we have a policy or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6651)|
| 1:50:59| So, that's what we established last time when we looked at it a few years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| Obviously, with a high school student, that's different because of the credits you have to have to graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| But I don't, so I would be concerned, honestly, about limiting it because of the fact that release time is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6671)|
| 1:51:20| So, I wish that they clarified that in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6680)|
| 1:51:29| Mr. Watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| My intent is to limit release time. I agree that is in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| And, you know, obviously in the elementary grades and the middle school grades, they wouldn't get a credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6695)|
| 1:51:42| You know, they would just be participating in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| I'm not sure that one's the magic number or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| I just, to me, I can see situations where, you know, every semester a kid would be jumping out to go get a credit for a release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6706)|
| 1:51:57| And, you know, I know you're saying the intent is probably for this particular organization to offer three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| I don't know. I think the K-12 system was not designed for this type of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6723)|
| 1:52:13| I'm not saying parents shouldn't have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| But I'm just wondering if the, even because the law is not specific, which I hate that it's not specific on that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6735)|
| 1:52:27| it seems like they should have addressed whether or not the intent was to get one credit ever or to get as many credits as release time courses are offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6747)|
| 1:52:35| Because, obviously, it can add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| And so, yeah, I think we should set some sort of limit, whether or not it's one or three or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| I would hate to see that all of a sudden some of our students are getting, you know, eight credits or something around release time courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6764)|
| 1:52:52| It also means they're not in the school very much when they're doing that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| Thank you. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| Mr. Watson, would you feel better about it if it were a pass-fail credit rather than an ABCDF credit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6782)|
| 1:53:11| Oh, and it didn't impact the GPA. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| Would that work so that it would be a credit, but it would be a pass-fail credit and wouldn't impact the GPA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6796)|
| 1:53:26| I mean, I would think that students that are taking this would probably want it included in their GPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| I'm not sure that the intent is for it to be a pass-fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| Because how is a pass-fail calculated into a GPA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| It's not at all. It's just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| I mean, I guess then the question is what's the point of getting a credit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| Would it hurt the GPA if there's not a GPA, a grade calculated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| The case I'm aware of with pass-fails is from prior experience with driver's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| In the summertime, we would have driver's ed credit available for students to take the course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| and we would do that on a pass-fail basis so it didn't impact the GPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| And it doesn't have a negative impact either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| It would still be a credit toward graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| And just to piggyback on what Dr. Wilson said, the GPA is figured off the number of courses that count on that scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| So if, say, this was a pass-fail and I had 27 credits instead of 28 or 31 instead of 32, that becomes a divisor for the GPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| So the pass-fail class just doesn't calculate in to get to that. Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| So usually you could earn up to 32 credits, and that's what you would use to divide and get to those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| If you had a pass-fail class like a driver's ed or a physical one, you would only divide that by 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| You just reduce that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| So the math could be, but it's basically that course is tossed out and counted for the GPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6889)|
| 1:54:56| So we could leave it so that they could take eight credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| and those would count toward their graduation electives but not in to the GPA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| You want to take it? I might hurt myself, Dr. Wilson. This is old memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| You'll probably just be cleaning up what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| No, I would say going back to the notion of eight credits, you still have to look at what are the required electives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| required credits that students would have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| That would be dictated heavily by availability and what elective space they had in their schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| So I don't know what that magic number might be for each student in terms of that, but eight seems like a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6925)|
| 1:55:31| It does. I'm just looking at the maximum possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| Oh, yeah, because if you look at the numbers that technically being released an hour, one class period a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| if you were on a rotating block, you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6940)|
| 1:55:49| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6949)|
| 1:55:50| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| Mr. Dupler, I'm assuming that the law is not clear whether or not it should be a pass-fail credit or another type of credit, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6952)|
| 1:56:01| And if that's not the case, does that mean a student who's going to go to this release time course that's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6961)|
| 1:56:11| will they get an A, B, C, D grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| And is the teacher issuing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| And does that get calculated in the GPA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| What's the intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| Is the law designed to be a pass-fail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| Is that the intent of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| Or are we intending that these instructors will give, like, how well you do in the course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| Like, you've got a B in that course, or you've got a C in that course, that release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| I mean, what's the intent of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| Because that can impact a lot of things for a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| And it seems like the instructor at wherever this organization is would want some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| Like, am I supposed to give them a letter grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| Do I just say they came every day, and that means they passed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| Can you fail a release time course and not actually get the credit even though you went?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| There's a lot of questions out there that are just, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| Is there any clarity about any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| No, the law is not going to specify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| The law just says you can award a credit, and it says you have to evaluate the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| So, again, you're going to have a course-by-course basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7035)|
| 1:57:20| Could there be a course that's a pass-fail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Could there also be one that's a letter grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| So, to that point, to me, that's why I'm having a lot of problems with this particular policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| isn't because it shouldn't be something that we should do because the law is allowing for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| It's because, to me, even this policy is still going to cause a lot of questions on the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| I mean, if I was this organization and I saw this policy, I would still have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| Am I supposed to grade these students who come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| Am I supposed to just track their attendance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| Like, how am I determining whether or not they actually get the credit that the board approved or not, the course credit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| I mean, there's no clarity on that, and I don't know that we've spent enough time to even answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| I think this is the first meeting that those types of questions have even been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| I'm not â€“ every time I, like, look at this, there's just, like, ten more questions that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7088)|
| 1:58:15| And I wish it was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| I wish it was more straightforward than that, but I do agree with Reverend Butler because I've already had some emails about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7096)|
| 1:58:25| For some, this is a contentious issue, even doing this, and I think we have to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7105)|
| 1:58:33| And some people in our community think we shouldn't even be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| Now, we don't have the ability to not do it or do it because it's the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| but to me, when it is something that's potentially contentious, for some, I think it is incumbent upon us to be as clear as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7120)|
| 1:58:49| and fill in the gaps that the law doesn't, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| We can't ask the law to fill in the gaps that it's not filling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| We have to do that, and I'm not sure that we've done the work, enough work on our end to fill in the gaps that the law doesn't address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7134)|
| 1:59:06| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| I'm not sure if anybody has an answer to it, but with the outside entities or the learning centers, the ones that have done this, what do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7148)|
| 1:59:16| Do they do pass-fail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| Do they do grades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| I feel like they would have some input when they come for an MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| I would think that they would have some insight to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| Yeah, I would definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| I mean, there are answers to these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| I feel like we're making this a lot harder than it has to be, frankly, because this is being done, and it's really, you know, not like this huge big deal in Campbell County from what I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7169)|
| 1:59:41| So, I think that for the people that don't like this, you know, this is, y'all know I'm always about parents' rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7181)|
| 1:59:50| It's not, these Knox County school students are not our students, I mean, our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| They're their parents' kids, and they ask us to help educate their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| So, if parents, the intent of this law, the way I understand it, if parents want their children to have religious release classes during the day, this allows for them to utilize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7199)|
| 2:00:11| So, that's up to the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| That's why it's not up to us if kids utilize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| It's not up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| It's up to their kids, so they get to make that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| So, I feel like that a lot of, I think that it really is, it's not, it should not be a laborious process for the school system to allow students to take advantage of this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7221)|
| 2:00:39| So, there are certainly questions, and there, I think that there, as Dr. Wilson said, I believe, we're at the beginning stages of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7239)|
| 2:00:47| This is a first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| There's a lot more conversation as far as an MOU and that kind of thing that will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| But, bottom line is, this is allowed for in the law, and the reason for this policy being before us is in reaction to the law being changed so that there could be utilization of the credit for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7255)|
| 2:01:11| I would have to say I agree with Ms. Horn, and I will be supporting this, because it is allowed by the law, and I do appreciate coming forward with the policy to just offer framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7271)|
| 2:01:22| And I agree, I think we're making this a little bit more complicated than it needs to when this policy is just offering that framework, and so that parents have that right to participate in this program if they want their kids to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7282)|
| 2:01:38| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| Ms. Horn, I agree with you in that the law allows for this, and we need to give parents the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7303)|
| 2:01:49| For me, this is not about liking it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| I went on record back in 2019, even though I wasn't on the board, that I actually would have voted for that policy that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| I would have been your fifth vote that you needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| And the reason I said that publicly at that time is because, to me, by not passing the policy, the district didn't give people clarity about how to access the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7322)|
| 2:02:12| That's why I would have voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| And so, to me, it's not that I don't want to vote for this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| I don't want to vote for this policy if it's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| And that's all I'm trying to figure out, is how do we bring a little more clarity to ask some of these things that I think are real questions that people are going to have when they do have the policy before them and are trying to exercise their right to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7341)|
| 2:02:36| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| I want to make sure we don't conflate the course with the credit because parents absolutely, under the law, have the right to put their child in a religious release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7358)|
| 2:02:50| We have no say in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| That's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| That absolutely exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| The only thing we're looking at right now is whether Knox County Schools is willing to give a credit for that course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7376)|
| 2:03:06| And that depends on a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| And I can't tell what exactly those things are based on this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7389)|
| 2:03:18| I think it's very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| We keep talking about an MOU, but we don't have an MOU with any of the organizations that students are currently released to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7403)|
| 2:03:32| And I don't see anything that says we have to have an MOU to give credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7412)|
| 2:03:37| So if that's something that's required, I don't see why that's not in the policy that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7417)|
| 2:03:45| It seems to me that this is very rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| And my concern is that when we rush a policy, the people who are damaged by that would be our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7428)|
| 2:03:59| Because we need to get this right so that they don't get down to the end of their school career and expect a credit that may not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7439)|
| 2:04:10| Or to not have all of the documentation that they need for their credit to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7450)|
| 2:04:17| We don't want students to have to serve an extra semester to be able to get the credits they need because of something we failed to do in our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7457)|
| 2:04:28| So, like Mr. Watson, I'm concerned that we get this right rather than that we get it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7468)|
| 2:04:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Yes, and I also wanted to make sure that I'm understood is that I'm asking questions about the policy simply because I want to make sure that we understand what our responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7479)|
| 2:04:58| And those who come to bring a course to be approved understand what theirs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7498)|
| 2:05:04| So that when we have to deal with something, one of these contentions or controversies, we're clear that this is what everyone has to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7504)|
| 2:05:15| Because, once again, we have a law that allows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| And when you have a law to allow something, you need to have a policy to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| And that's what my concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| It's not necessarily whether we do it or not because the law says that it's allowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| And we have those who live in Knox County who want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7530)|
| 2:05:36| But I do know that when you open it up for one, you open it up for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7536)|
| 2:05:43| And we need to make sure that the law, the policies are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| I think we've got to stop meeting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7547)|
| 2:05:54| So my concern is that whatever policy we have is going to be a sound policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| So whoever brings whatever, they know what they need to bring, and we know what our responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7559)|
| 2:06:07| Thank you. Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| Mr. Triplett, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| Based on this policy as it's written, it does follow the law, correct, even though the law may be a little vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| But it does follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| Does the very fact that they have to get it approved, that there is some measure of approval by the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7580)|
| 2:06:28| does that then make it a requirement based off that that they have an MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| or can they just walk in and drop off a curriculum and we can approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7593)|
| 2:06:39| I mean, I guess how does â€‘â€‘ is there some requirement there, some method that they get that approved by, or is that not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| I think I'd agree with Dr. Wilson on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| I mean, since this is a relatively new measure, I certainly think an MOU would be a good way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7610)|
| 2:06:59| Is that the only way to go about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| Perhaps not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| I mean, now, could they just drop off a curriculum and just walk off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| Probably not either, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| I mean, there's going to be some process involved for the board and the administration to truly evaluate the course in a secular fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7628)|
| 2:07:17| But to your point, yes, an MOU would be a good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| But, again, I just â€‘â€‘ I don't want to go on record saying that's the only way because there's likely other ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| And is that figured out in procedure then, like we have a policy and then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| Dr. Rice and his team come up with the procedure for how that plays out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| Is that where that fits in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| I mean, it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| And then the other follow-up question, could we let the course determine whether it's pass, fail, or graded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| Is that acceptable, just to say we're going to approve it and then the course itself, whoever's running the course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7665)|
| 2:07:52| We have courses, you know, when we had driver's ed, it was pass, fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| You have other classes that are graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| Can the course determine that on its own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| My reading of the law is that each course would stand on its own and could be evaluated in that fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7680)|
| 2:08:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7695)|
| 2:08:16| I see no other lights on on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| So, and honestly, I'm not familiar with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| That's the reason why I'm asking the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| I'm not familiar with the entities that provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| But part of what a memorandum of understanding does is that it addresses certain things like liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7711)|
| 2:08:39| And once again, I'm looking at this from a holistical, clinical, theological perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7719)|
| 2:08:51| I just made all that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| But faith and religion, I take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| And so there are some people out there, and I'm not talking about anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| So if anybody think I'm talking about you, I'm not talking about you unless the shoe fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7747)|
| 2:09:14| But with young people and minds and you start talking about certain things, we need to make sure we know who our kids are going to be learning from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7754)|
| 2:09:26| So that makes the parent responsibility, because it is a parental choice, that makes the parent responsibility so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7766)|
| 2:09:35| But what responsibility do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| I know it says we won't look at the course content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| But there's so many things going on with so many different entities that are detrimental to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7782)|
| 2:09:51| And we talked about that, that we want to make sure that this is an entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| So I think that an MOU would be one of those things to ensure that parents have a responsibility, the entity has a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7796)|
| 2:10:07| We don't know what kind of insurance they have, what kind of checks they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| who, when we work with after school and we work with before school and we work with different entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7811)|
| 2:10:18| we know that they're doing background checks and all of those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| We don't, do we know any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| And quite honestly, that's part of my concern is when we look at a policy like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| to what extent do we as a school district have as a responsibility to make sure kids are not going to a release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7831)|
| 2:10:41| especially when we talk about giving credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| What is our responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| And that was a concern I had as I looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| because I know when people come in and start teaching faith, religion, and certain things, it's so easy to be drawn away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7851)|
| 2:11:00| So I'm going to leave it, that's why I'm going to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7860)|
| 2:11:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| So I'm going to try this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| Seeing no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| Question, board members, we, well, we have one more item under board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7875)|
| 2:11:22| We're a little over halfway through our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| Does anybody need a break or do we need to, yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| So let's do this last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| Does anybody have on policies and at least finish that section and then we'll take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| So does anybody have any discussion on item I on board policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7896)|
| 2:11:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| So we want to take a quick break, maybe 10, 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7906)|
| 2:12:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| We are back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| So moving on to grants, 8A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7924)|
| 2:12:13| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| I do have a question about 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7935)|
| 2:12:18| After board approval of this, when can the school start spending that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7938)|
| 2:12:25| Is that right away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| Madam Chair, Ms. Henderson, Ms. Martin is here and can answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7947)|
| 2:12:41| Thank you, Madam Chair, board, superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| They can start spending immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| They will be relieved to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7972)|
| 2:12:56| Heard that a lot from schools waiting for that to come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| Item 8B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7981)|
| 2:13:07| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| Mr. Watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| The preschool development grant in terms of a model preschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=7995)|
| 2:13:21| I'd love for Becky to come and share a little bit more with us about that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| From my understanding, we're only one of five in the state who got that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| So I'd love for you to take just a moment, kind of highlight some of the good work we're doing in the early education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8010)|
| 2:13:35| and specifically what you're hoping this grant will be able to do for us and our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| Dr. Roswick, school board, others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| So we are very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| We were one of five school districts to be designated as a model preschool district in the state, which is really wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8026)|
| 2:13:53| The idea behind the grant was to approach preschool and support for families in an innovative and different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8033)|
| 2:14:02| So what we're doing through this grant, first of all, we are situating it's a classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8042)|
| 2:14:09| and lots of support in that classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| We are situating it at Moreland Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| Dr. Van Buren is very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| I spoke to he and his assistant principal today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| They were very, very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| So the idea behind the grant, our kind of approach to the grant is to look at family supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8062)|
| 2:14:31| and how we can build supports for families around early literacy and child development, workforce development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8071)|
| 2:14:40| and kind of family stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| We're working very closely with Boys and Girls Club through the Vestal Boys and Girls Club Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8083)|
| 2:14:48| which is fabulous, and using that Boys and Girls Club Center during the day because it sits empty, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8088)|
| 2:14:55| There's nobody, there are no children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| So using that for some opportunities to engage families around early literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| There are lots of partnerships involved in the grant, which is the most exciting part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| So working very closely, like I said, with the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| Marcus is wonderful and is all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| They're all in for preschool, which is so exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| And also working with Friends of Literacy, with the health department, working to get some dental options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8119)|
| 2:15:27| working with the mobility counselor that is someone who works with CAC and Boys and Girls Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8127)|
| 2:15:34| and they are actually housed right there in the Vestal Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| So providing our families with access to those supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| Lots of opportunities for development, you know, how to develop literacy in your home, love of reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8143)|
| 2:15:48| love of learning, and that early engagement in school so that when our kids are ready to access preschool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8148)|
| 2:15:55| they're ready to fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| And that's the big idea behind those supports for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| I talked with Dr. Van Pelt today, and we were even discussing opportunities for new moms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8162)|
| 2:16:09| or maybe moms that haven't had that baby yet and accessing information around healthy child development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8169)|
| 2:16:16| and how to engage your child early on with language development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8176)|
| 2:16:21| Another big part of the grant in terms of workforce development is not only supporting a family member of a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| who might be interested in furthering their workforce options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| but also working very closely with our teachers' assistants who are in preschool in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8192)|
| 2:16:39| and working with them to provide funds so that they can get their child development associate certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| which is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| I'm going to meet with Pellissippi soon to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| And one great thing about that is it articulates well into a Grow Your Own program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8210)|
| 2:16:57| so that we can start our teachers' assistants who have hands-on experience toward that path of licensure in early childhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8217)|
| 2:17:05| It's really hard to find preschool certified teachers, so I figure we just need to grow our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8225)|
| 2:17:10| So that's going to be another big part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| But the biggest piece is around those wraparound family supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| We've seen this work so well in our community schools, but those aren't always accessible for preschool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8238)|
| 2:17:25| so this is looking at the needs of a family with preschoolers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| and how we can support them in being experts in their own child's development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8248)|
| 2:17:35| So we are excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| Like I said, we are one of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| It's us, Nashville, Claiborne County, Milan, and Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8258)|
| 2:17:46| So we are very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| That's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Thank you for you and the team and all the work that's been done on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| So with it being kind of an innovation or a model-type grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| what are some of the ways that you'll kind of be measuring the impact of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8274)|
| 2:17:58| and then what's the hope in terms of being able to take some of what's being learned there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8278)|
| 2:18:02| and rolling it out to maybe our voluntary pre-K program or things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| Personally, I want to roll it out all over the district, but you all know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| So this is a preschool development grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| This is considered a year one grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| Normally with a preschool development grant, it's really about the thought and the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8297)|
| 2:18:22| not the kind of application, but we're doing all of that this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| with the idea that we can get model preschool grant money from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8306)|
| 2:18:32| which is much, much more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| to look at the scalability of what we're doing for our families across the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8314)|
| 2:18:39| or in different regions in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| So that's really the big ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| Let's pilot this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| Let's see what this looks like and see how we engage families so we can expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| In terms of looking at the measurement, we do assess our preschoolers three times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| which is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| We look at their alphabet knowledge, their numeracy knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| and then their development of social-emotional skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| So we'll continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| Another big piece of our preschool assessment is asking kindergarten teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8347)|
| 2:19:13| how they feel our students do in comparison to their other children who may not have had preschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8353)|
| 2:19:19| And I gave you those documents attached to the VPK grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| Our kindergarten teachers always brag on the way our families are involved in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8364)|
| 2:19:31| and the improved attendance once children hit kindergarten compared to their peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8371)|
| 2:19:38| Also, their literacy base and their numeracy base, they always state that our preschool children do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8378)|
| 2:19:47| So we will continue to ask those questions of our kindergarten teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| I think along the way, the big piece of this, the missing piece in preschool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8392)|
| 2:19:59| is how are we involving parents early on so that they understand the importance of an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8399)|
| 2:20:05| So frequent surveys of our parents, asking our parents questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| What do you need? What are your biggest concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| So that we can kind of pivot to support those families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8412)|
| 2:20:16| In my mind, that's the most important thing we do in preschool is introduce our parents to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8416)|
| 2:20:23| and love of school and engagement with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| So those will be some of the kind of metrics that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| Fantastic. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| Thank you, Beth. Don't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| I turned my light on before, Mr. Watson, because I saw you here and I wanted you to be able to come and talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8438)|
| 2:20:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| So thank you for all your work with preschoolers and also with parents, educating parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| I think that's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| So thank you for all that work that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| And really my question was around the funding from the Department of Ed grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| And I feel like I should already know this, and I probably do and can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| Is it increased to last year for our voluntary pre-K grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| It was actually $10,000 less, and I was not happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| And I let them know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| I'm sure you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| There was actually a statewide cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| What was really sad is all preschool programs received a $10,000 cut, regardless of the size of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8479)|
| 2:21:27| So when you think about $10,000 spread out across 29 classrooms isn't as detrimental as in our smaller district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8487)|
| 2:21:35| So it was a little bit less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| We are still not 100% funded for preschool through the state, but thankfully our school board recognizes the importance of preschool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8497)|
| 2:21:46| and you do make up the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| Thank you for letting us know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| Yes, you are so welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| On the preschool grant, if you want to thank a legislator for sponsoring that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| it was sponsored by Representative White and Senator Hale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8523)|
| 2:22:08| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| We're also working hopefully to get some more funding to support aftercare for preschool families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| so hopefully that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8540)|
| 2:22:21| I do not have a question for you, Beth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| I just wanted to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| You know I'm a big fan of you, and I tell you, Beth works so hard to involve our families, our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| and she hit the nail on the head when she talked about foundational skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| and it really does begin at the preschool level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| Before that, we always talk about K-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| but you are doing a phenomenal job of really focusing on the fact that it really does start before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8559)|
| 2:22:45| and just thank you for everything you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| I think you're incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8567)|
| 2:22:48| You are so welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| It is our goal to make sure our children thrive by five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| That's where we're going with this, so we are going to make sure that they all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8578)|
| 2:23:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| On grants, items D or E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8584)|
| 2:23:10| Item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8590)|
| 2:23:14| Moving on to contracts, 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8594)|
| 2:23:21| B or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| Mr. Dupour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| I'm supposed to say something about B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| So in structure, you know, we kind of went back and forth with them last year when we finally got a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8612)|
| 2:23:40| so this one, we've been pushing it down to the last minute as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| I met with folks from procurement last week, and we met with in structure representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8625)|
| 2:23:52| and we are close to having some acceptable language but not quite there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8632)|
| 2:23:57| What's on the board agenda is still a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| It will change, but we'd like to keep it on for Thursday in case the final version does come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8641)|
| 2:24:10| So that this can be implemented sooner as opposed to later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| But if it doesn't come through, I can certainly announce that on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8662)|
| 2:24:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| Agenda items, 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8667)|
| 2:24:34| 10B or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8674)|
| 2:24:41| 10D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8681)|
| 2:24:48| E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| I'm just wondering if there's anything from collaborative conferencing that is different than prior years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8691)|
| 2:24:57| or if it's essentially a similar agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8697)|
| 2:25:05| Madam Chair, Ms. Horne, it is very similar to previous agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8705)|
| 2:25:11| There are a couple of changes, an update to workers' comp language based on the board policy that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8711)|
| 2:25:18| There is an updated reference to collaboration on results of the salary study as well before implemented into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8718)|
| 2:25:26| and I think Mr. Bolton can correct me if I've left anything out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| but I think that those were the two big changes, and Ms. Hancock is here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8729)|
| 2:25:38| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| You did call item E correct as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| I have a couple of questions related to item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| Ms. Himmelgarn, can you speak generally to the need and the use of a differentiated pay plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| and what we're trying to accomplish with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| and then also if there's any substantive changes in this year's differentiated pay plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8761)|
| 2:26:02| I'll take the last part first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| The substantive changes are, one, on tuition assistance, assuming that the change in board policy change is passed on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8765)|
| 2:26:16| There is an addition of our KCS EPP participants to our tuition assistance policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8776)|
| 2:26:21| so that would be reflected in differentiated pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| and then our Region V specific supports are updated in the differentiated pay plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8784)|
| 2:26:31| One answer to the reason for it is it's required by the state every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| but also it is a benefit to incentivize and reward employees that are staffed in different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8795)|
| 2:26:44| so our hard-to-staff areas with signing bonuses, those are hard-to-staff endorsements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8804)|
| 2:26:49| and then math, science, SPED, differentiated pay for leadership opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8809)|
| 2:26:57| so our lead teachers and some department chairs, so opportunities for leadership and advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8817)|
| 2:27:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| How are you able to determine the effectiveness of a given strategy on the differentiated pay plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| I'm sure it's probably different depending on the particular strategy, but could you give some examples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| Sure, and you're right, it is, because some are incentives to come to work for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8836)|
| 2:27:23| and then some are incentives to stay at work for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| so I think evaluating the recruitment piece is different than evaluating the retention piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8846)|
| 2:27:32| So we can look at the recruitment piece based on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8852)|
| 2:27:37| there are engagement surveys that may tell us whether that affected an employee coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8857)|
| 2:27:43| but also our vacancy numbers could partially tell us whether those strategies are effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8863)|
| 2:27:51| The retention piece, we can look at, we have a clause in some of our signing bonuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| most of our signing bonuses that are a payback clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| if they don't work for us within a certain amount of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| so whether an employee has to pay back a signing bonus can tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| whether or not they have stayed for that required period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8886)|
| 2:28:11| The leadership opportunities, the lead teacher, the department chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8891)|
| 2:28:17| those would mostly be evaluated at the school level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| the benefit to the employees and the leadership development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8901)|
| 2:28:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| Is part of evaluating our overall differentiated pay plan structure also included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8909)|
| 2:28:36| will there be potential recommendations for the differentiated pay plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| coming out of our salary audit that we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8919)|
| 2:28:45| Mr. Bolton may have more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| He just had his most recent meeting with them today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| but they would be looking at our whole salary schedule, including the differentiation in pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8930)|
| 2:28:55| so there could be recommendations that come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8935)|
| 2:28:58| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8938)|
| 2:29:03| Ms. Helen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| I just wanted to check and see if our collaborative conferencing team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8946)|
| 2:29:09| wanted to say anything about that MOU while you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8949)|
| 2:29:19| Paula Hancock, Knox County Education Association, and really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| and thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| and Superintendent Riesvig for making the recommendation about our MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8966)|
| 2:29:31| but I just wanted to take an opportunity to really share with you that the labor of the PECA team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| and the collaborative conferencing team on both the management side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8976)|
| 2:29:39| and also the professional educators, that their labor has not been in vain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| I don't think we get an opportunity to brag on you all enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| and also to thank you for everything that you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| but we've been in a collaborative conferencing since 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| and in that we have definitely have set some goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| and we haven't quite made all of our goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| but I'm glad that we have the opportunity to continue to work towards those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| One of the goals that we had set some time ago was that we would be in the top 20 of salary rankings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9001)|
| 2:30:07| within the state by 2020, but then we had COVID happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| but even at that we have been able to move the needle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| and I know when I started with collaborative conferencing back in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| because I've been on the team for that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| but we have been able to move that needle from 44 to 32,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9021)|
| 2:30:25| so currently with some current rankings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| So we've been able to make some sustained salary improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| For the last three years we've been able to see 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| and I just want to thank you all because with the board absorbing all of the health care costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| it has allowed our teachers to really realize some of their percentage increases in their salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9041)|
| 2:30:47| and not for it to be absorbed in just the insurance increases as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9047)|
| 2:30:51| I want to thank everyone, too, because from the standpoint of our classified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| when we got a 4%, our classified people got a 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| and I know Ron McPherson, he was very good about letting us know exactly how much money it was going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| for everybody to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| but we're extremely excited about the fact that Superintendent Reiser has been able to increase that to 8%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9068)|
| 2:31:15| for our certified people and also to take care of our classified members as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| So I just really wanted to take this opportunity to thank you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| and to let you know that it has been a collaborative effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| We are moving the needle, and it has not been in vain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9086)|
| 2:31:30| So thank you all so much, and we greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| Thank you, Ms. Hancock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| So any other discussions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9097)|
| 2:31:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| Item E, I think you've already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9106)|
| 2:31:53| Yeah, we did that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| Item F, Mr. Triplett, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9118)|
| 2:31:59| My intent in bringing this up is really just to make sure our Monday meetings add value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9119)|
| 2:32:04| Of course, it would be on a meeting where we had quite good, robust discussion on the Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9124)|
| 2:32:11| This is the 11th meeting I've been on the board a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| and it seems that our Monday meetings go one of two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| One, we don't really have any discussion, and then we discuss real heavy on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9138)|
| 2:32:23| and it's almost like why do we even show up on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| We just kind of read through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| Or we'll have a discussion on Monday, and then we come back on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| repeat the same discussion, and then vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| And lots of folks come to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| Members of our community come when they have an interest or a passion about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| Obviously, a certain number of our staff is required to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9160)|
| 2:32:43| Some come when there is an agenda item that is in their area of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| And I just want to make sure that there's value in that Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9168)|
| 2:32:53| One of the reasons, as I've thought through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| is related really to the timing of when we get the agenda versus when we're ready to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9176)|
| 2:33:02| So if we get the agenda on Thursday afternoon, evening, and then on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9182)|
| 2:33:08| if you work a traditional eight-hour shift, eight-hour schedule during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| really the only time you have to ask questions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9193)|
| 2:33:16| talk to the folks in your district, in the schools, talk to central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9196)|
| 2:33:23| is really just a few hours on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| That's the only time you have to ask questions and really get answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9205)|
| 2:33:28| And so I think that limits our ability to really have good discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9208)|
| 2:33:32| because we come to the meeting with a whole bunch of questions we haven't had answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| because we really haven't had time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| We discussed some of this related to public forum and their opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| and maybe having them sign up by Friday and not having the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| But I also think we don't really have the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| and members of our community don't have time to speak to us about items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| before we begin to discuss them on a Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9233)|
| 2:33:57| So I'm just wondering if there's value in that Monday meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9237)|
| 2:34:01| in us continually having a Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| If there's value in it, then I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| It's not a hill I'm willing to die on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| But at the same time, I feel like I've come to so many Monday meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9249)|
| 2:34:15| where either it's nothing and then a lot of discussion on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9255)|
| 2:34:18| or it's some discussion and then a rehash of the same discussion on Thursday and then a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9258)|
| 2:34:23| So, you know, I'm obviously open to thoughts and what other people think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9263)|
| 2:34:28| but those are my concerns related to the value of the Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9268)|
| 2:34:39| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9279)|
| 2:34:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| I agree with you about having the timeline very compact makes it difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9282)|
| 2:34:48| and I think that makes it difficult for the community to reach out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| And so often they don't hear about items until after they've seen that Monday meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9292)|
| 2:34:58| and then they reach out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| And just for fun, everybody has a spreadsheet just of the history of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9301)|
| 2:35:10| It is just a list of the kinds of meetings we've had historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9310)|
| 2:35:17| There is a 10-year period missing, and I'll fill that in as soon as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| But if you'd kind of like to look at how things have historically been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| and how they've changed over time, that is available there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9326)|
| 2:35:30| There was a time when the board went ahead and scheduled a called meeting or a special meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9330)|
| 2:35:37| and then they canceled it later if they didn't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9337)|
| 2:35:41| And I think eventually that turned into the mid-month work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9341)|
| 2:35:47| and then those mid-month work sessions were fairly regular for a while, for not quite 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9347)|
| 2:35:56| They were fairly regular for a while, and then those more recently were dropped back to quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9356)|
| 2:36:06| I think it's helpful when we have lengthy presentations to have those in a mid-month or a quarterly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9366)|
| 2:36:15| and I think that keeps us more focused on our agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| But if we could either ensure that the staff is getting items to the agenda quickly enough so that it can be published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9379)|
| 2:36:31| or that we maybe push back that agenda and have it published sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9391)|
| 2:36:36| that might give the public more time to communicate with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9396)|
| 2:36:46| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| Mr. Trivlett, thanks for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| Anybody who knows me out in the public sphere knows that the last thing I want to do is go to another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9412)|
| 2:36:57| I think meetings should be really intentional and purposeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| And I can also guarantee that outside of elected capacity I would never agree to this many meetings for anything that I ever serve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9420)|
| 2:37:07| I think we're all in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| Where the two meetings have been helpful, and I'm not speaking about all the other meetings that we have in terms of workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9430)|
| 2:37:15| and things like that, but with the rhythm of the two meetings in order to get through a particular agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9435)|
| 2:37:20| where that's been helpful to me is I often don't want to vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9440)|
| 2:37:27| at the same time I'm hearing everybody else's thoughts about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| because I need to be able to process what I'm hearing from everybody, and that often takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9450)|
| 2:37:35| And I brought this up when we moved the meetings to Monday, Wednesday, and then Monday, Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| I actually, to me it was more helpful to have them Wednesday, Wednesday when I had a full week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9460)|
| 2:37:47| And the reason is I do work, I mean I work a 40-hour-plus week, and I know you do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9467)|
| 2:37:53| And it allowed me time to be able to really ask questions based upon the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9473)|
| 2:37:59| and go further with the administration in between to where I could gather some more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| to be able to make a really good informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| And my concern is if we move to just one meeting where we're discussing the agenda and voting in it at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9487)|
| 2:38:14| I think my confidence level in trying to make a good decision is probably going to go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9494)|
| 2:38:19| because I don't know that I can both meet the needs of my constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9499)|
| 2:38:23| get all the information I need from the administration, and also hear from you all, my peers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9503)|
| 2:38:28| in that one condensed meeting enough to be able to make a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9508)|
| 2:38:32| Now, you know, obviously 90 percent of what we vote on, I mean, it's pretty routine and we just do it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9512)|
| 2:38:38| It's all the other things that I think the community is really paying attention to and wants us to pay attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9518)|
| 2:38:44| I'd love to come up with another way to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| but I don't know how to do it besides having a meeting that is really designed for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9526)|
| 2:38:52| and then the other one is really designed for the voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9532)|
| 2:38:56| I think the reason why oftentimes in the voting meeting we have a lot of additional discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| I think it actually highlights the point I just made, is that in between the meetings people learn some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9540)|
| 2:39:06| And so you kind of bring up that new point of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| Like even earlier tonight when we were talking about the policy around the credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9549)|
| 2:39:16| I made the comment about I may bring a motion to do X, Y, and Z, but I don't know that I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| Like I need to give some more thought to that to really decide because we had a good conversation around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| So that's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9567)|
| 2:39:28| I mean, don't get me wrong, I think my kids and wife would want me home more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| I could be wrong about that, but I just don't know how we get it done in a compressed schedule like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9573)|
| 2:39:39| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9582)|
| 2:39:43| I do think there are some boards that do one meeting, but I think for our board it's beneficial to have two meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9583)|
| 2:39:50| because I do think that there are questions that sometimes we bring up on Monday that we need an answer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9590)|
| 2:39:56| so I think that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9596)|
| 2:39:57| But I think to your point, Mr. Triplett, I think there are times that we sometimes don't have any discussion on Monday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9597)|
| 2:40:04| and then we have a ton on Thursday night and that we rehash a lot of the same things over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9604)|
| 2:40:11| kind of during that same week of the same topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| So I think we've had times on this board where we've had more just robust conversation on the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9615)|
| 2:40:25| and then we have very little conversation during the voting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| and that's kind of the expectation that a lot of people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| So we do keep the staff here two nights really late when we're kind of rehashing everything again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9635)|
| 2:40:43| So I do think we need to be mindful of everybody's time and make sure that we're trying to be as prepared as we can on Monday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9643)|
| 2:40:52| so that we're having that conversation and covering everything as much as we can Monday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| so that on Thursday hopefully we can answer the questions, highlight points we didn't have a chance to highlight before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9658)|
| 2:41:05| or new information but that we just kind of come in ready to be efficient so we can get those votes taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9665)|
| 2:41:13| so that that meeting can be more concise and a little bit shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9673)|
| 2:41:20| So thank you for bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| And I would just say I would agree with what Susan said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9683)|
| 2:41:26| I think sometimes the frustration is with that rehashing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9686)|
| 2:41:30| I mean clearly there are some times you aren't going to change other board members' minds on things, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9690)|
| 2:41:36| And I don't know how productive it is to have the exact same conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9696)|
| 2:41:42| especially during the more contentious items as you had that Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9702)|
| 2:41:50| when everybody's already kind of signaled how they're voting and has strong opinions one way or the other on an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9710)|
| 2:41:57| So, you know, I can appreciate that frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9717)|
| 2:42:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9723)|
| 2:42:04| So anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| So we will move to â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9733)|
| 2:42:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| So I'm not sure if I'm understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| Did we decide anything or are we just done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9738)|
| 2:42:24| That's my only question because we said discussion or possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9744)|
| 2:42:28| So we just had discussion with no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| Well, Mr. Dickler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| Thank you, Madam Chair, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| So this is not a voting meeting, Reverend Butler, so, I mean, there is only discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9755)|
| 2:42:40| But with the possible action, someone could make a motion on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9760)|
| 2:42:45| But, again, it doesn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| It's just possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9768)|
| 2:42:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9772)|
| 2:42:53| Yeah, pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9775)|
| 2:42:56| Someone could bring a possible action on Thursday or not based on this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9776)|
| 2:43:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| Or it could be I'm withdrawing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| I mean, the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9790)|
| 2:43:11| So that concludes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| And we will move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9798)|
| 2:43:19| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9801)|
| 2:43:22| The item we added, Mr. Dickler, did you want to speak any more about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9802)|
| 2:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| Does anybody else want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9808)|
| 2:43:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| We do have a few folks signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| Ms. Hancock, would you like to speak again or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9824)|
| 2:43:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9825)|
| 2:43:46| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9826)|
| 2:43:47| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9827)|
| 2:43:48| Our next speaker, I am so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| I'm probably going to butcher your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9832)|
| 2:43:53| So I will just say Mr. or Mrs. Missou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9833)|
| 2:43:58| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9838)|
| 2:43:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9839)|
| 2:44:00| I didn't want to butcher your first name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| Just state your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| My name is River Mutsu, and I'm a Knox resident and representative speaking on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9853)|
| 2:44:18| Rationalists of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9858)|
| 2:44:22| And we're a secular 501C religious organization, and I'm here to follow up on the emails that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9862)|
| 2:44:28| were recently sent to everyone by our president, Lee Erickson, as well as some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9868)|
| 2:44:36| that have been addressed presently, which I appreciate such nuanced discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9876)|
| 2:44:41| It does everyone good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| The board of Rationalists of East Tennessee is against providing credit for release time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| courses and religious moral instruction because, and this is not to assume any intention one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9887)|
| 2:44:53| way or another, but historically the First Amendment might be thought of as a kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| a ceasefire between the religious organization of the early United States as they grappled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| for control of government with government power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| We believe this proposed policy change, allowing accreditation of release time activities under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9903)|
| 2:45:08| the name of a Knox County Schools violates the letter and spirit of that ceasefire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9908)|
| 2:45:14| To emphasize the need for such compromise, if the Knox County Schools policy is changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9914)|
| 2:45:20| and allows giving school credit to any religious organization for release time classes, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9920)|
| 2:45:26| RIT could be, they're prepared to produce some content of equal school credit for moral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9926)|
| 2:45:31| instruction based on secular humanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| There is ample material from which to provide it, choose from, including modern experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9933)|
| 2:45:41| philosophers, professors, and humanities, such as historical deists, such as Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9941)|
| 2:45:46| Paine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| Since morality evolves, for example, questions regarding the Bible's continued fossilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9947)|
| 2:45:53| support of slavery, such as Leviticus 25, 44 to 46, as distinct from an ancient servitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9953)|
| 2:45:58| despite the Constitution's improvement to abolishment, it would be examined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9958)|
| 2:46:03| There's many examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| You can go down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| RIT asks whether the board has discussed how those classes would be released in categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9966)|
| 2:46:14| and school course catalogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| We certainly advocate against such listings, but if the change of policy is adapted, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9978)|
| 2:46:26| support that the full results of the syllabus evaluations be made public by the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9986)|
| 2:46:32| Board of Education to ensure the secular nature of the review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9992)|
| 2:46:37| Again, please leave the I-122 policy unchanged and save everyone much trouble and controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=9997)|
| 2:46:48| And your time, attention, and consideration are deeply appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10008)|
| 2:46:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| Lance, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| I don't have to give you instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10021)|
| 2:47:04| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10024)|
| 2:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10029)|
| 2:47:10| Lance McCold, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10030)|
| 2:47:13| So I wanted to speak about the I-122, the changes to I-122 that were proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10033)|
| 2:47:20| The discussion today was very helpful, but I wanted to highlight some things that I understand here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10040)|
| 2:47:30| First of all, this policy has nothing to do with parent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10050)|
| 2:47:35| Parents are totally, by law, allowed to choose to put their kids into a Related Least Time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10055)|
| 2:47:43| This is only about whether or not the board will give credit for that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10063)|
| 2:47:49| Now, when the board gives credit, we are actually putting the infrastructure of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10069)|
| 2:47:57| schools on that course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10077)|
| 2:48:00| Even though we may not have blessed it, everybody else in the world is going to think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10080)|
| 2:48:07| And the second thing I want to say about it is that there is no compelling need to give credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10087)|
| 2:48:12| There are plenty of opportunities for kids in high school to get 22 credits without ever getting â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10092)|
| 2:48:19| I mean, even if they take release time, there's plenty of time for them to get 22 credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10099)|
| 2:48:24| They can get 32 if they go into a block schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10104)|
| 2:48:28| This is really â€“ giving credit is really a gift to a private entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10108)|
| 2:48:33| It's using public resources to give a gift of apparent credibility to this private entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10113)|
| 2:48:40| It's â€“ and then along with it, it's going to take staff time and your time, your valuable time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10120)|
| 2:48:49| We've been talking about how much time it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10129)|
| 2:48:52| Well, when you start having these courses come in, you're going to have to evaluate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| and you're going to have the public have an opinion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| We just heard from the Rationalist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| You know, very likely a lot of you would be uncomfortable with the Rationalist religious courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10143)|
| 2:49:09| and then you have to say, well, this is all I'll say is I have to give credit to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10149)|
| 2:49:14| because I gave credit to these other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| And the Rationalist may not be the most unpopular group that comes to you with a course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10156)|
| 2:49:24| that they want you to give credit for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10164)|
| 2:49:28| This is â€“ I mean, you're just making trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10168)|
| 2:49:33| I mean, if you approve this policy that gives credit, if you offer the possibility of giving credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10173)|
| 2:49:39| you are just making extra work for the board and for the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10179)|
| 2:49:43| and it will only benefit the entities that are proposing these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10183)|
| 2:49:48| It won't help our students and it's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| It just seems to me like a gratuitous gift to some entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10192)|
| 2:49:57| And I think finally I'll say that the fact that Ms. Horn has chosen not to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10197)|
| 2:50:03| not to name the entity that she's brought, is very much evidence about she doesn't want them to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10203)|
| 2:50:09| because she's afraid it would be controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| Now, that's just a guess, but I'm sure that there's going to be other people who will be controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10212)|
| 2:50:17| and you will be sorry you have to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10220)|
| 2:50:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10221)|
| 2:50:22| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10222)|
| 2:50:27| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| All right, so moving on to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| Ms. â€“ is it Yertle? Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| Yertle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230710?start=10237)|
