| 0:00:00| Jack McElroy-Knoxville-New Sentinel and his attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5)|
| 0:00:06| Commissioner Harmon, you want to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6)|
| 0:00:08| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=8)|
| 0:00:10| At the intergovernmental meeting, our law director presented a very thorough analysis of the matter that came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=10)|
| 0:00:17| That very day we were having our committee meetings, we were presented with a proposal by the law firm of Hollow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=17)|
| 0:00:23| and Hollow, attorneys for Jack McElroy and his Tennessee Open Meetings lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=23)|
| 0:00:27| And there was active discussion and several good points were raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=27)|
| 0:00:32| And I thought, how can I write a resolution that addresses those points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| and gets us to the point where we all can be happy with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:39| I thought the only way we can do this is really what the lawyers call the functional equivalent, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=39)|
| 0:00:44| of a consent agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| That is, I know a number of commissioners said we don't want to admit to violating anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| but at the same time we want to avoid the cost, the public ridicule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=50)|
| 0:00:56| All of the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| And we need quick resolution of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| So my thought was, why don't we admit no violation, but also agree to the terms of the New Sentinel said for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=61)|
| 0:01:09| equivalent of a do-over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| And that furthermore we clarify that those persons who were appointed at our January 31st meeting are de facto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| office holders, just as the actions of previous county commission with term limited persons on them amounted to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| de facto government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| This, of course, no matter how we handle this, presents a nightmare associated with voting privileges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| And I suggest we resolve that nightmare simply by saying that we interpret the charter provision saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| replacements are by the remaining commissioners to mean those 11 commissioners who were neither appointed on the 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=98)|
| 0:01:46| or were removed from this body because of term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| That actually yields 11 of us who will be voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| The second appointment process would start when the, assuming it works out, when the law director tells us we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| reached this agreement with McElroy and his attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| And there's a series of steps where people submit materials, there's a candidate statement period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| followed by a workshop style discussion, a vote on the countywide offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| And realizing that a group of 11 and a majority set at 10 is a really high standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| I suggested that if there are votes where we do not achieve that majority, we could move them to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| And then by unanimous consent and only by unanimous consent, commissioners could actually engage in the sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| how else would we put it, negotiation that should always have occurred in public anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| If you like candidate A and I like candidate B in this particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| maybe we can work out something where we all get a little bit of what we want, but we do it in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| So that was sort of the slate method by which only by unanimous consent we would consider them other than one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| And all this would be done in open public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| and that we agree to be faithful to the spirit and letter of the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| I think this is a way out of the mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| I think it is a dignified end to something that has caused us great indignities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| And I suggest that we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| I think this is a reasonable way to answer this matter in a way which faith is resolved and with faith is restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=195)|
| 0:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| And thus I move to approve this and ask the law director to follow through with our proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| I don't see where we have the legal authority to remove commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=222)|
| 0:03:49| You know, we live in a country that's governed by laws, and we have to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| And, yes, there's a lawsuit, and maybe we're going to have to take this to litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| but I do not see, I can see where a judge has the power to remove commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| but I don't think we as county commissioners have the power to remove these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| And I believe that if anybody moved to remove Josh Jordan or Richard Cade or Lee Trammell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| that they would have a very good case to be able to sue us because we don't have the legal authority to remove them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| And I understand some folks didn't like the way the appointment process worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| Quite frankly, I wish they would have let the old folks serve until we could have an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| or that we could have had some sort of a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| But, unfortunately, we had to make the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| And, unfortunately, the new sentinel seized some fault with the process, and they've sued us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| Well, this has got to go into litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| We can't just sit down in a country of laws and decide, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| we're just going to throw the law books out the window and we're going to throw some folks out of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| when we don't have the authority to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| I think we need to let the legal process work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| I think that's what we've needed to do from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| And I think that this proposal throws us into more legal trouble than we're already in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| Because how do you propose that we throw someone out of office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| Because I just don't see where we've got the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| May I ask the law director a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Would not a consent agreement agreed upon before a judge have the legal authority that Commissioner Lambert is exercised about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=320)|
| 0:05:28| In my opinion, it would if it were passed by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| Well, you know, I can't go along with what Mr. Harmon says over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| According to the Supreme Court, it says, according to the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| the county officials who are ineligible to hold office due to term limits may continue as de facto officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| until their successors are named in accordance with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| So, in all reality, what Commissioner Harmon is trying to do is go against the Supreme Court's ruling here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| He's saying these people shouldn't have voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| The charter says, I mean, the Constitution says vacancies in county offices shall be filled by the county legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| and any person so appointed shall serve until a successor is elected at the next election occurring after the vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| and is qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| The Knox County Election Commission, the election commission, cannot conduct a special election to fill these county vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| Rather, the election commission shall place these county offices on the regular August 7, 2008, election ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| Now, we've appointed these people to serve when we appointed them to 2008, August 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=397)|
| 0:06:45| So we're opening ourselves up for a lawsuit there, I feel like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| Now, another thing, Mr. Harmon, I take this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| I'm not like one commissioner who thinks we're making a joke of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| I respect our Constitution very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| And when we start chipping away with it, trying to pass laws and circumvent it, we're doing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| There's just no way that we're supposed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| We've got safeguards to take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| The people we're not taking a vote away from, they'll have a vote come August 7 before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| And I resent us sitting up here and trying to circumvent our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| Now, we could say a lot of things up here and do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| But what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| Every time something comes up that you don't like, you come up with something against the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| Every time something comes up that I don't like, I come up with another law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| This is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| And I don't know who won or lost on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| I had nobody in the sheriff's department talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| I had nobody in the mayor's office talk to me about these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| And I do not feel like myself personally that I've violated any law or I've taken any rights away from any of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:56| Now, if you didn't conduct things properly in your district, Mr. Harmon, that's your fault, not the ninth district's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Mr. Chairman, I was mentioned directly and I would like a point of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| This is not about the Constitution of the state of Tennessee or the Constitution of the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| We all swore to uphold those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| We also swore to uphold our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| And the laws of the state of Tennessee include an Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| Our law director has advised us that there's a serious possibility we could lose this lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| and these things that we have done will be declared null and void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| Rather than going into it in a manner that we do not like, let us take advantage of the opportunity now to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| and say we can offer this consent agreement where we admit no wrong, where you don't have to admit you did anything wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| in your district or anywhere else, but we get it resolved in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| This isn't about who won and who lost because the public lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| The public lost when we did not do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Now, the charter that we swore to uphold and that five members of this body sued to invalidate said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=540)|
| 0:09:09| that the remaining members of the commission shall fill said vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| This is a reasonable interpretation of the law because if you try to get a second vote now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| whether by my resolution or forced by the court, you're entering a legal miasma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| Let's look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Who has the right to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| If we declare them de facto commissioners, then the persons whose terms we agreed to serve have ended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| because their successors are de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| And a good court can make an argument that those persons who we bring back to vote don't have the right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| There are so many possibilities here for challenging the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Why not take control of the process, admit to no errors if that bothers us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| but do the right thing and do it in a way that we all can respect and the public can get behind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| Mr. Harmon, one correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| I don't think the law director has ever said we've got a serious chance of losing this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| Commissioner Pinkson, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Well, I voted to uphold the charter, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| And I don't feel like anybody up here violated the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| Section E of the charter says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| in all proceedings of the commission to either elect officers of the commission or to fill vacancies in elected offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| the following procedure shall be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Nominations may be made by members of the commission only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| And I feel like we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Once again, I'd just like to disclose I do work for the Knox County Trustee's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| We're getting to know where you work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| I'd just like to disclose that I know I'm supposed to disclose if I need to disclose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| The open meetings law, in order for us to do a redo, there must be evidence that the law was broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=652)|
| 0:11:03| Now, it's my understanding, Mr. Law Director, that unless someone from this body voluntarily says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:11| I broke the law, or unless there is evidence to show that the law was broken as it stands right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:20| there is no reason to redo this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| It would be evidence from the body as it existed on January 31 at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| There are eight commissioners here who that statement would not govern, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| Have you heard from any of those eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Have they said, I violated the Sunshine Law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| I have not talked with every commissioner, and I have not heard anyone make such an admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:49| I guess my point is this, is in order for us to do a redo, that has to take place, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| There must be evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| There has to be concrete evidence that, indeed, the law was broken and that the Sunshine Law was violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| Now, a judge can make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| I don't know that we as individuals can make that determination, unless someone stands up and says, yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| I think this body may make that determination, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:21| Each individual commissioner may make it themselves and vote on whether to have a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| I don't think you have to have a judicial determination in order that there be a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| My sense is there are not ten votes on this commission to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| And so I guess we're looking at the legal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| But let me ask you, where are we now in the legal process with this lawsuit that the Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| and I guess the one that Mr. Monsier has brought against us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| Where we are now is we're in the process of reviewing the complaint and drafting responses to the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:59| Now, that can include any number of things, including an answer, motions to dismiss, motions for summary judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:08| And what's on the table right now is what I see as a counteroffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=788)|
| 0:13:16| Basically, that's what Commissioner Harmon, I believe, has proposed is a counteroffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| That's why I felt compelled to bring the new Sentinel's attorney's letter to the attention of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:30| at committee meetings was so that you could consider it and either today or at some future date either agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| if that is this body's wish, or you could make a counteroffer, or you could do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| We are in the process of defending the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| And if this body decides to make a counteroffer of some sort, then it's welcome to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| And I will carry that back to the new Sentinel's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| But in addition to this lawsuit, we also have another that was filed by a local attorney for a number of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=839)|
| 0:14:08| And there are eight commissioners on this body that are sued personally in that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| And they are each in the process of obtaining private counsel to litigate that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| In addition, Knox County is there, and I will be there representing Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| That lawsuit is the deadlines in that lawsuit are approaching more quickly than the lawsuit that is being discussed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=866)|
| 0:14:35| I believe the 30 days from service for most of the defendants in that case runs this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=875)|
| 0:14:43| So answers or motions will need to be filed by the end of this week in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| In this case, we've got another week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| So I want to get on the record again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Have you advised us, what Mr. Moore had said earlier, that, what was it again, Mr. Moore, that Mr. Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=893)|
| 0:15:02| I need to ask Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| What was your statement about the law director and what he had advised us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| Well, he may not have ever used the words that we're likely to lose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| but I think he gave us a good outline of what would happen if we were to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| And that was a rather daunting prospect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Are we likely to lose, in your opinion, at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| I do not basically give advice or wager on whether we win or lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| I basically defend the facts as I receive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| And we're in the process of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| But I have, I don't have a crystal ball, and so I can't advise this commission whether we will win or lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| Well, there's no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| John's never lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| There's no question that when you look at case law, violations of the Sunshine Law, the remedy is for a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| And there are many instances where that indeed has happened across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| So, yes, this is to be taken seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Violation of the Sunshine Law is a serious matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| However, I would again point out there must be evidence that indeed the Sunshine Law was violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| Unless this commission votes to do a redo or unless someone stands up and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| I violated the law or it is found through discovery or through deposition or through a court hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| a judge could force a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| And let me ask you one final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Would all 12 instances be determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| I mean, it could be determined that all 12 might need to do a redo if a judge were to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| But could a judge also say, no, I think everything was okay, and one, two, three, four, you have a problem with five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| and six, so it's possible not all 12 would need to have a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| And that's the way I see it and that's the way I interpret the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| You know, basically, with a redo, that is a cure for whatever action occurred at a previous meeting that may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| occurred in violation of the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| And if you had one matter, for instance, one ordinance, and we're about to vote on a couple of ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| but if you had one ordinance at a previous meeting that someone complained that there was a violation of the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| then at the next month's meeting, at a succeeding meeting, you could have a redo, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| You could approve or reject that item again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| And that would cure any potential defect that was that had occurred or allegedly had occurred at a previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:22| You would not have to redo the entire meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| It would only be as to that one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| Okay, Commissioner Tate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| Let me, Mr. Law Director, let me maybe make another suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| I think what you point out is correct, that this is kind of a counteroffer, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| I'm not necessarily ready to go with this today, but I think we should make some type of counteroffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| I don't know how we get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Maybe you could work with the chairman or individual commissioners and come up with some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| And maybe, I mean, I would like to make a counteroffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| I'm not willing to agree to everything the new Sentinel wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| However, I am willing to try to move forward and settle this some way if we can, if it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| Let me say this to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| Commissioner Harmon just basically suggested that he would be uncomfortable in, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| in approving of a redo where there's been no clear violation of the act, at least no evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| That was Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| I mean Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| What about the prospect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| And, you know, this is a counteroffer and whatever we would vote on today, whatever you would vote on, would be a counteroffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:58| What about a counteroffer that stops short of a redo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| I mean, I would just suggest that as I don't know if that would be acceptable to the plaintiff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| but perhaps some remedy short of a redo might be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| I mean, it's certainly worth a thought, and I would think it would be worth an attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| But it could be done today, it could be done at the next meeting or whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| What is the worst scenario that would happen if we lost the lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| What are they asking us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Basically, they want every seat that was filled by virtue of the meeting of January 31 to be vacated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:52| that that whole process be voided, that there be an injunction entered against each individual that perhaps violated the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1192)|
| 0:20:07| That was found to have been violated, to have violated the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| And that would be a determination made by court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| I sort of agree with Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| I think we just need to, nobody stood up and said, I've committed a sin, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| or I've broke the law, so I feel like we just need to move on and get this county moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| Every commission meeting is going to be like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| We need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| I agree with what Mr. Hammond was saying there, saying that nobody has stood up and said that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| that they've done anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Nobody is going to do that, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Nobody is going to stand up and say, I broke the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| My question is to the law director, let's say the people from the public say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| but they've got information that we, that one of us did or three or four of us did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| What happens then, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| I mean, I think that's where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| I mean, what we're about to launch into, I'm sure, is a discovery process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| And there will be, there could be written discovery where we have to answer interrogatories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| and production requests, which include records, personal records of each commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:24| There could be depositions taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| We have two of these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| I would hope that the depositions would be taken concurrently, that you're looking at approximately 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:43| or so depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| They take an enormous amount of time and they take an enormous amount of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| For the eight commissioners who are in the other lawsuit, the lawsuit that was filed on January 31,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:59| they are expending their own personal funds for attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| It comes at a personal stake in both time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| In my opinion, that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| The public is very, very upset with this, very upset with how things went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:23| And I think some things are going to be challenged with what Commissioner Hammond came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| He's trying to save us this trouble in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| This is the first I've seen of this with what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| We've got a very long process that's going to be ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| I'm not saying, you know, that I'm going to vote against these commissioners that were put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| The way it was done wasn't on the up-and-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| Well, Commissioner Smith, I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| I'd like to have the floor with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| What was not done on the up-and-up, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| Well, for one, you let one commissioner come in that would be sworn in, but you wouldn't let somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| Just a moment, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Everyone had that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Were you not at this meeting when that was the first thing he said, that anybody that is sworn in can take their seat immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| Well, then how come we let in not just the person that was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| Well, you must be attacking the person that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Mr. Smith, the law director sat here and told us that anybody that was sworn in could go outside out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| and come back in and take their seat immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Then how come we let Mr. Bolus in, but we didn't let Mr. Cate in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Mr. Cate didn't go in then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| He tried to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| I declined to get sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Larry, you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Larry, you're doing the Knox County injustice of what you're saying and what you said on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| but saying people don't take this serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| I do take it serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| I'm not wearing a white hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| I'm up here to vote for what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Now, I'm not running for mayor and all that stuff like you're talking about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Don't laugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| I'm just telling you the truth now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Who done what wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| I'm one commissioner that done something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Now, you've accused us it wasn't on the up-and-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Name what's not on the up-and-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| I resent you talking to me like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Or let me, yeah, and then Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| Yes, law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Would this not be, would Mr. Harmon's proposal, would that not be a conflict of interest for any of these eight folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:36| That have just been appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| I feel like it puts these folks at a catch-22 if they vote yes for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| They're voting to have themselves thrown out of office if we have the authority to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| which I still don't believe that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| And if they vote no on it, then it can be used against them politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| I would challenge that the eight that were appointed are ineligible to vote on that because of a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| Is that a conflict of interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| And would they be ineligible to vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| I do not believe it would be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| I mean, personally, it would be a tough decision to make, but it wouldn't necessarily be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| I do not believe that they would be disqualified because of a conceptual conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Let me give him my thoughts for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| I believe Lee was after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Come back to me if you don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Let me just remind everybody, it's 416.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| We've got a couple more items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| We're supposed to start zonings at four, so if we can try to move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| The state legislature has a study committee that Commissioner Hammond is on this study committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| and they're trying to put some teeth in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Could we go to the new Sentinel and offer an agreement to wait on the study committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| The study committee comes back from the state legislature to see what the state legislature says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| see what laws they're going to put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| After that, I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Is that a substitute motion, Mr. Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| Because if it is, I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| Yeah, I'll make that a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| And I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| They've got a study committee in Nashville and the legislature is looking at the open meeting law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| You know, who does it, how many people does it take is one of the questions, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| Is it two or is it a quorum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| The question is now before the General Assembly and it's before the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| Now the legislature is going to have to determine how they want this committee to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| As we were having our meetings in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| we told them that we did not have adequate time to answer the questions they wanted us to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| and those are some of the questions being answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| This law has not been looked at in about 20-some years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| so that's why they're wanting to look at it to really take some of the vagueness out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| put some teeth into it, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| But as far as where we are in that process, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| It's in the legislature's hands now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| and they'll have to determine how they want to proceed with this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| and how they want this committee to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Commissioner Hammond, also I think last year in the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| they approved some stuff where it is a quorum for the legislature to violate the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| I'm not familiar with that specific bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Well, they did that last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| but the legislature has to determine is it two commissioners or is it a quorum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| And I certainly feel very comfortable if it's a quorum that this lawsuit would be going nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| And I haven't seen any evidence of any, even two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| You know, people need to bring these things forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| I mean, we're going to find out in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| but I've always been the kind of guy that if you get sued, you know, you've got to defend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| It's not us suing anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| I believe what was introduced last year is actually what has led to this committee that Commissioner Hammond is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| What was introduced was a much broader, I believe, definition of what is required under the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:08| It makes it very clear under the new legislation that it takes two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| or more members of a legislative body and not necessarily a quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| which, you know, leads me to believe that with that lack of clarity in the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:30| whether this body, whether it really takes two or whether it takes a quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| I believe that question remains unanswered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| That is one of those things that we're going to be arguing in defense of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| In addition to that, the law, the new legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| would provide that there be a $50 personal fine attached to each and every violation of the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| In addition to that, it would require that the burden of proof shift from the person making the allegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| to the official who has been alleged to have violated the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| So basically what it does, it puts the official in the position of proving a negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| which is very hard to do, very difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| But that is what has led, the discussion of that is what has led to this committee that Commissioner Hammond is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| I believe there are 17 members or so, Commissioner Hammond, to your committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| I know the county attorney in Hamilton County is one of the members of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| and I've corresponded with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| But I don't believe that the committee is ready to make their recommendations to the legislature about that law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:45| that there may be a number of other bills that are pending as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| But as far as this motion goes as to what you're suggesting, Commissioner Trammell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| that we request that the litigation be stayed pending the resolution of the, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1797)|
| 0:30:12| pending the recommendation of the committee to the legislature in possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| Is that what you're suggesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| It's been seconded by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| We've got a call for the question, but we've got one on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Commissioner Ballard, you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| We'll do roll call starting in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| A vote yes will be on Commissioner Trammell's substitute motion to stay this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:53| Until the study group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| A counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| It's really a counteroffer to stay the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| It can't be stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Yes, a counteroffer to stay the case of the study committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| I guess I've got a question as to exactly what are we voting on because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| are we asking the new sentinel to stay their lawsuit until this committee comes back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:17| Is that what your interpretation is, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| That's what I believe the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Now, I don't know how that will be received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Of course, the new sentinel would then have to come back and agree to do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| A wholly unlikely proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| I can agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| We'll start in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1900)|

| 0:31:55| Commissioner Cawood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1915)|

| 0:32:02| Commissioner Craig Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Mr. Chairman, because I'm still an active member of that committee, I recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| And one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| If the law director has any other suggestions as you fashion this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| feel free to contact us or I would encourage any member of commission to contact him if they have any ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Commissioner Bellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Commissioner Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1967)|
| 0:33:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| We have 15 ayes, two noes, one pass, and one recused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Oh, we've got a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Yeah, I just wanted to add a comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| I think today we've seen a little bit of more togetherness moving forward, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| One thing that maybe sticks in my crowd just a little bit, I think there's some great leaders in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:42| And some of the higher positions, such as the two mayors, the sheriff, and the attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| I think they really demand and command our respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| And, you know, sometimes I think we can really have an intense dislike for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| They should come in here and be prepared to answer our tough questions and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| but they represent Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| And I also have seen and talked to some of the other guys that's been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| used to the citizen come to the podium and got out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| I think there was a switch back there that you could turn him off and maybe ask him to leave and what not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| And I guess maybe if we won't call him on Lumpy's shoot him up day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| there's a little laughing whenever we made the resolution that you quickly got in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| and said you didn't think it was a point for a lot of laughter like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| But, you know, as we as a body here, we really shouldn't be picking on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| I mean, I know there are going to be tense moments and passion and exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| And I don't know how else to say this, but when you have a sitting mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| call him a four-year-old kid in Candyland because he don't get his way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| But, look, guys, any of us that don't get in the way, that could apply to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| And I really think that should be called out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| But I would be dispassionate if it was one of you all, if it was the attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| if it was a sheriff or any one of the sitting mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| And I don't want to debate that or go out on a limb and be alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| But I think there really needs to be that sort of camaraderie in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you, Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| I'd like to second what Phil's trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| And that is that we are a body that we're trying to act with civility most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| There's some of us that forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| I greatly respect the arguments that are taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| the positions that are taking place during these difficult times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| I especially appreciate Paul and his position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| I appreciate Mark Harmon's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| They diverge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| There's very good arguments here for several perspectives about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| And I would just like for us, just as Phil has just done, encourage us to come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| to respect each other, and respect our positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| They keep sending us these letters that say, the honorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| And I think we need and we are trying, for the most part, to act in an honorable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| We may disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| The people that are going to elect in February are going to have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| And I think, just as Mark said, there is a lot of anger and it will not go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Yeah, I just wanted to address the topics that Mr. Ballard brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| Mr. Leuthold did apologize to me for the quick draw comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| They were taken in good humor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I don't think he meant any offense by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| And I did apologize to the mayor earlier in the hall privately, and I'll do that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| You know, I think what we've seen here today is the way a county commission meeting should work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| with both the executive branch and the legislative branch working together for the betterment of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| We've got a couple of more items and some people have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| Do we want to go on into our zonings and come back to these items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| It's up to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Don't we have to do ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| If we have some citizens who want to speak, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| I think they probably ought to be allowed to speak so they can go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| We have a lot of business to do and very important business to do, and we'll keep after it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| But if we have some that are here to speak on the general agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| I think now would be time to give them some time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| I don't know if we have or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| We've got a couple of people on the stormwater staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Well, that would be they should be heard when we hear those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| Do you want to hear them now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| That's up to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Okay, we'll hear them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Commissioner Smith, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| Yes, for the record, for Mr. Pinkston, I have no intention to be running for mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| nor have I had any thought of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| And I'm just trying to do for the 7th District as I always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| And, you know, I've been in politics a long time and I'm trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| I want to apologize to the commission here and the people of Knox County for my actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| but I will not apologize to Commissioner Smith because he accused us of not being on the up and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| And all I want him to do is tell me who's not on the up and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| And I resent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| I was a used car dealer for 30-some years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| It took me a long time to build my reputation up to what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| where people thought I was something or I wouldn't be here or my brother wouldn't have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| And I resent people attacking my character and the character of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| Now, Mr. Smith, you told me here at this commission meeting, not me, but also the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| and every commissioner here, that you had been working on your political career for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| Now, I don't know if I'd been working on it for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| I'd certainly want to go a little bit further than county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| I'll say I've been active in politics for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| That's all I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Let's move to Clerk 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| This is an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| approving the Stormwater Management Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Deferred this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| A Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:08| Recommended deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Deferred 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Mr. Rowe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Yeah, I was going to say, if there's anybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| She has signed up to speak on 101 and 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| We're going to defer 101 for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Do you wish to speak on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| I'd just like to say while she's come to the podium, we are going to have a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| Is that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| We're going to ask the mayor to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| We need to do it pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Mr. Rowe, you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| My comments are very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| The new ordinance uses much discretionary language rather than mandatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| which we feel is very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| Additionally, public participation is one of the six minimum control measures of the MS-4 permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:05| There's been no public meetings where the public's had the opportunity to comment on the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| or the permit regarding our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| In contrast, in Charlotte, North Carolina, they had 25 meetings for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| Enforcement is the key to the success of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| according to the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| But detailed penalties and fines are really not a part of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| Chattanooga was fined quite heavily, I think $25,000 a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| by the EPA because they failed to meet all the aspects of their MS-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| The cost to Knox County and even the city of Knoxville could be devastating if we don't get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:48| The public can be a great asset in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| and we can be your partners in protecting our water resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| I'm glad you voted to defer action on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| but we ask that you consider in the public meetings that they're actually public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| and not just a PowerPoint presentation that we have seen presented in different parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| They need to be public meetings where we can have dialogue with different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| and the citizens can really show portions of the ordinance that they have problems with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| So I hope you'll consider that, and we certainly need more than one meeting. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Thank you, Ms. Rowe. Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Yeah, I'd just like to make sure that the public is notified, not just through e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| We need to put it in a paper and let them know when it is, where it is, and what to be expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| Okay, I think we're going to be working with the administration to set up some meetings. Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| I'd just like to thank Ms. Rowe for her work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| She has done a significant amount of work on stormwater issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| and she needs to be publicly acknowledged for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| And so I'd like to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Yeah, in accordance with this, and, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| we have a lot of new commissioners here that have not gone through any of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| In terms of a public review of it, much of that language is technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| So what would need to be there would be technical experts to discuss with citizens for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| and then for legislators and commissioners to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| Otherwise, we might be hard put to know what a solution is, because, I mean, there are answers that you must do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| can do, do you have, can you go a different route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| I mean, what are the alternatives for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| So just to hear from the public without technical kind of answers kind of leaves the commissioner somewhat not knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:57| where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| So whenever those meetings would be held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| it would be great that we would have those experts there so that we could hear them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| and the citizens at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Very well put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| I think the city and county both are working on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| and hopefully have someone from city engineering along with the county to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| and come up with a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Okay, ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| This is an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| approving regulations for flood damage prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Intergovernmental voted 9-0 for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to point out that there's some weakening here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| that we should be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| In the definitions, the base flood is weakened from a 500-year standard to a 100-year standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| Floodway is weakened the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| On page 15, also we go from a 500-year standard to a 100-year standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| We're going the wrong direction on guaranteeing our stormwater issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| and that they're as strong as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| We're going exactly the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| For that reason, I either suggest we amend this or defeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| We have someone here from engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| Yeah, I'm Chris Grangeau, stormwater management coordinator for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| Actually, what was done in that ordinance, it was actually clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| There's no change in the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| If you read through the actual construction requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| the requirements remain one foot above the 500-year flood elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| The changes in the definitions were just made to make the terminology that's in our ordinance consistent with FEMA floodplain terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:52| So when people are getting flood insurance and going through that kind of paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| they're using the same words for the same elevations, the same numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| So we're not weakening the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| The performance standard is exactly the same as it was in the previous version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| The only state law requires or FEMA regulations require that the ordinance specifically references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| the effective flood insurance maps, and those would be the 2007 maps rather than the 1983 maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Are we looking at having a meeting on the stormwater ordinance within the next 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| I was wondering if we could have, since this is first reading, it's going to come up for second reading in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| if we could have this as part of that stormwater meeting as well because I'm going to have some questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| I don't want to take up time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| It's certainly something that's related to stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| There is a requirement that this is adopted by April of 2007 so that to protect against any kind of loss of coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2811)|
| 0:47:02| under flood insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| I'd like to hear from Ms. Rowe about this because she also has studied this one and wanted to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| We have to vote on it today, otherwise we're voting on it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| We know that flooding is now a very common occurrence in Knox County due to the design storm requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| the steep slope nature of the terrain that's left in the developable property, the increased volumes of runoff due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:38| to increased permeable surfaces and the inability of the conveyance system, the developments in the downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| to transport peak flow and volume of runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| Mr. Weitrick in the Office of Neighborhoods told us this afternoon that no changes were being made to the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| ordinance with the exception of just the new date change from the FEMA maps from 81 to 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2877)|
| 0:48:06| But we feel there are three significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| The 1994 Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance, which this is a remake of, requires that the stormwater design be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:19| for the 500-year base flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| That definition for base flood has been changed from 500 to 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| Also, throughout the document, it refers to the base flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| So now you're talking about the 100-year rather than the 500-year, which is more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| There was a county in North Carolina that just recently at their county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| and I'll have that paper when we go to a public meeting, but it says, please, let's go to the more restrictive 500-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| So it is a more restrictive argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Also, the definition of floodway within that document, too, has been changed to the 100-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| This is a very important document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| It's also a sister document of the 1983 ordinance that has been adopted by city council for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| They have not changed theirs to meet FEMA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| They left it the 500-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| For this document to be the same as the city's, which is what the purpose of the two documents was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| that they would be alike and have the same restrictions, those changes need to be made back to the 94 ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:38| In other words, the 94 ordinance could still be used and just change the date of the FEMA maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| That's all that needs to be changed if you're truly not changing what the document says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Thank you, Ms. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Chris, I guess she's saying that we are changing to 100-year flood, and your opinion is we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| We've changed some of the wording because the ordinance, it previously referred to a base flood elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| There was a definition of base flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| That is confusing to people because a base flood elevation is actually a term of art when you're dealing with flood insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| when you're dealing with FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| So we changed the ordinance to be consistent with the terms of art that are used in floodplain management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| The ordinance itself refers to the 500-year base flood, 500-year base, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| 500-year floodplain elevation as the design point, the design requirement for house construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| or any kind of construction in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| So the functional requirements remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| It can be confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| Commissioner Harmon and Ms. Rowe say the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Can we change the wording to what they say, or does that change what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:58| Functionally, we're trying to clean it up so that people, we deal with a lot of folks who have questions about flood insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| you know, on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| We get dozens of calls every week about flood insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| We thought it would be helpful in terms of from a customer service perspective to be using the same terms in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| regulations that they're seeing when they're dealing with flood insurance, when they're dealing with FEMA forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| As far as functionality, they're absolutely the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| It's really, I'd say it's at this board's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| You are the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| We do need to reference the 2007 flood maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| But you are the professional in Knox County, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| Are you the professional in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| My recommendation would be to correct the nomenclature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Do you agree or disagree that we're not as strict as the city flood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| In the flood damage prevention, this is exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| Functionally, this is exactly the same ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Since this is an ordinance on first reading and we'll have to approve it on a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| I suggest we go ahead and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| And if there are some differences that we can maybe clear up by next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| if our engineers could get together with Ms. Rowe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| and some other citizens to make sure that we're all on the same page, I think we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Mark Harmon, the only no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| We're on public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| Oh, motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| We're on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| Jenny, I'm going to try not to butcher that last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Provada, Provada, if you'll come on down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3173)|
| 0:53:02| If you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| It's 444.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| My name is Jenny Provada and I'm the Adrian Burnett PTSO president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| I live at 4229 Spar Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| Permission to have my son pass out the letter that our PTSO has written for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| Yeah, just have him come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| I'd like to start with a brief history about Adrian Burnett because I know we have lots of new faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| that may not be familiar with our school and its history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| In 1975, Knox County Schools built three temporary structures out of wood to ease overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| That would be Cedar Bluff, Adrian Burnett, and New Hopewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| Thirty-two years later, we're still battling overcrowding in the Knox County School System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| In 1992, Adrian Burnett began a quest for a new school, and part of the problem we're having, ironically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| is what we're discussing today is term limits and people going in and out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| Several people that we have spoken to, Mary Lou Horner, Dr. Lindsey, Dr. Sharon Roberts, Diane Dozier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| a lot of these people are no longer in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| So when we start to make headway, they're no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| So we wanted to come before the entire county commission to make you aware of our situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| In 2005, we became a SACS accredited school, and they said the largest obstacle that we have is our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:21| and the limitations thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| According to the Knoxville Realtor MLS system for the past six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| the number of closed new construction single-family housing units in Halls and Gibbs has surpassed that of the Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| and Hardin Valley areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Adrian Burnett, if we did get a new school, would ease the overcrowding that the new Gibbs School will inevitably be faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:47| Knox County already owns the land that Adrian Burnett and our sister temporary school, New Hopewell, will be constructed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| By building simultaneously, Knox County not only saves money by leveraging the cost of the building supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| but you could use a similar design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Taxpayers will undoubtedly be happy to hear that 1,200 students in four elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| and two school zones will be in a safer environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| The cost of maintaining inadequate aging buildings would also be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| In 1992, we were put on the list of schools to be replaced within five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| In 1997, we should have had a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| Our son Gregory was born in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Ten years later, we're still in a facility that was built for 15 years to hold 500 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| and we now have 655 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| I'd like to share a couple of my experiences with this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| On the fifth bullet point on the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| notice that the walls are separating from the ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| A couple of years ago, we had a first grade classroom that had a couple of wasps come into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| We're not talking about the typical situation where all the kids get to go outside for a few minutes and enjoy a brief recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| We're talking 150 wasps had got in that crack and could potentially harm those children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| The cost of litigation had one child allergic to bees been stung| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| would far surpass what it would take to construct a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| I went to school last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| I had lunch with my son Gabriel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| All of the children that were in the portable buildings because of a windstorm were brought into the main building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| That building is meant for 500 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| We now have 655 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| If in the event when those children are brought in and we had a fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| do you realistically think that all 655 of those precious faces can make it out of there safely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:47| If children did what they were supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Allstate wouldn't spend thousands of dollars producing a video that says, don't hide, go outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| In closing, Adrian Burnett understands the budget limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| and we would like to move from being a part of the problem by having costly repairs each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| that drain what little funds you do have to build schools to being a part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| We'd like to know what we can do to ensure that before you leave office that we will have a new safe school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| that doesn't limit the academic achievement of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| You want to introduce your guest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| I know you had the principal with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Have him stand up maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| We brought Phyllis Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| Speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3448)|

| 0:58:04| Certainly, if you go to Adrian Burnett and then you go look at the new Gibbs School up in the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| Commissioner Ballard and Commissioner Hulston, you see how very nice it is and a big, nice gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| And certainly, we just don't have that at Adrian Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| But certainly, we've got to get to work and make sure we get these things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3496)|

| 1:00:11| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| We have all 19 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Clerk, if you'll do the first request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| First two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| This is for the Spradlin Place Development, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| The first is for Northeast County Sector Plan Amendment from Agricultural and Rural Residential to Low Density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| The second request is for rezoning from PR Plan Residential at two dwelling units an acre to PR Plan Residential at 2.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| They're located on the southeast side of Maloneyville Road, southeast side of Stair Drive in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Eighth District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Per MPC recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Per MPC recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| May I ask a question of the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| I understand the staff recommendation was to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| Is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Could you share with us the staff reasoning for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| We felt like the development pattern around the property and what was taking place, it was more consistent with the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:13| dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| There's some topographic constraints on the site that are not necessarily that critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| but we felt like the two dwelling units per acre from the staff side was more appropriate given those particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:30| considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| So the staff recommended the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| The Planning Commission voted to increase it by a half dwelling unit to 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| We've got a motion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Only by way of perhaps further response to Commissioner Harmon's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:51| this is the last phase in an overall development, a larger development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| The developer doing the part that had previously been done at one of the two dwelling units per acre experienced some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| difficulties with TDAC and had some other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| We took over, in essence, bought them out, and then we had this last remaining phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| We have done some redesign that cured TDAC problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| They had been planned to cross the stream about six or seven times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| We've cut that by more than half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| We've made some other expenditures to cure some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| And for that reason, since we're only getting to do this last phase, we need a little bit more density to finish it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| If you look at your map, you'll find right on the south boundary of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| there's one piece of property that, in essence, is surrounded on three sides by our proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| That gentleman is Mr. Raymond Ritter, who is the person obviously most potentially affected by what we propose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:56| He actually wrote a letter to MPC urging support, recommending support of our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3776)|
| 1:03:04| And after pointing those matters out, MPC passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| As I said, almost as close to unanimous as you can get and still not get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| I believe it passed on a vote of 12-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| We've got a motion to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Commissioner Mark Harmon votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| This is a request of Oscar Stiles for rezoning from May Agriculture to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| The property is located on the northwest side of Andrew Johnson Highway, north of Pleasant Hill Road in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| We'll defer that until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Next two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| The next two are requests of J.M. Gordon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| The first is for northwest county sector plan amendment from LDR low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| and SLPA slope protection to C commercial and SLPA slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| The second is for rezoning from May Agriculture to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| They're located on the northeast side of Oak Ridge Highway, northwest of Bobcat Lane in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Let's get an MPC report first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| Members of the commission, you have a request here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| You have two requests, one for a sector plan amendment from low density residential to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| Both have a slope protection designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Then you have a rezoning request from Agricultural to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| The Planning Commission did approve a rezoning of plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| The property is located on the north side of Oak Ridge Highway in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| You have some commercial zoning in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| Let me turn to that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| Primarily back to the east on the south side you have some commercial zoning in place as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| Some of the zoning in the area, in fact, a good bit of it is under the city's plan C6 commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| What you've got in this area, you've got some topographic constraints that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| although the staff and the MPC felt like plan commercial was appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| you do have some topographic constraints that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| We feel like that they can be addressed adequately under a plan commercial designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| which allows a little bit higher level review, a little bit more review by the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| as well as the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| It also allows public review of a site plan as it comes through the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| The approximate size of the tract is about five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| Again, you are on Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| And there is some commercial zoning and development already in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| With those thoughts and comments in mind, again, the Planning Commission voted to approve the second plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| to commercial and slope protection and recommended a rezoning of plan commercial for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| And that was a unanimous vote, 13 to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Does the applicant want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| My name is Mike Gordon, 7721 Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| We requested a zoning from agricultural to CA, and it passed the MPC, 13 to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:30| And the PC also passed 13 to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| So we feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Can you speak into the microphone, Mike, just a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| And we feel that the MPC passed it 13 to nothing on both recommendations that it should be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Excuse me, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| I'm new to the process here, and I do suffer from stage fright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| But my name is Daniel Britton, and I own and right presently reside at 6543 Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| which is 150 feet to the west of the property you're considering rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| My dad owns a property between me and Mr. Gordon here, and I have power of attorney from my dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:15| My dad is not able to participate in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| Mr. Gordon bought this property that I'm going to assume on a speculative basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| It exists among five other pieces of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| and that I have no indication that Mr. Gordon wishes to reside on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4048)|
| 1:07:36| At first, me and my dad and one of the statements I'm going to use is being a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| And Mr. Gordon bought the property, bought it fair and square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| And I had conversations with Mr. Gordon, and me and my dad discussed those conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| and at first we decided we would not oppose the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| But I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| I talked to Mr. Gordon about being good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| I also talked to him about his plans at that time that he wanted to build a self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| I also did a normal learning curve and learned more about self-storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| I mentioned our concerns about this piece of property going commercial, that we plan to reside on our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| And this is wood property, except down on the very front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| We did see the signs regarding that the request was for general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| We did receive the postcard that this was for planned general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| I'm talking about general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| I went to the MPC meeting, and my intentions there was to voice my concerns that this would carry forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| as me and Mr. Gordon had discussed, into being a self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| However, when I got up to speak, plans had been changed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| Now we're talking about planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| I was caught off guard, was not prepared to make comment on planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| And even though that the minutes on the Web don't show it, I feel very confident that I'd attempted to get in a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:09| you know, a postponement until I could look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| Well, the end result is that the MPC decided to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| They may not pass it, but recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| So it's coming before you all now for passage, final passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| Now, the problem there is I feel like I wasn't granted a postponement to study the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| and that they have brought it to you for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| At the same time, I'm also aware now that when anything happens in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| and that's going back to the same people who did not grant me a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:47| and also in this process, too, that through a use of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| that the restrictions that we have for planned commercial can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4193)|
| 1:10:01| As I said, the situation has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| Someone changed their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| So at this time, after learning a little bit more about zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| taking a look at examples of zoning on Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| such as Bobcat and a piece of property above it up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| me and my dad have changed our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Are you all aware of the documents I sent you regarding the deed to the private right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| that exists in front of my dad's property and also in front of the Gordon property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| I sent an e-mail to constituent services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| I faxed a copy of all my information to constituent services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| I am also in possession of an e-mail for Mr. Greg Lambert and also Sharon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:56| And I did not receive a file from Ms. Sharon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| and also Mr. Lambert did not send me a reply acknowledging that he had received the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4258)|
| 1:11:06| So if this should be the case, how can we stand here and look deeper at this subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| if you don't have the information or your organization has the information to make a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| But in this case, my dad has a deed to the strip of property that extends from my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| all the way down to Mr. Gordon's corner property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| Mr. Gordon only touches the state at that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| So, therefore, we contend that he owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| He legally owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| He's had this since 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| And that any use of this easement, other than the burden that would be imposed by a use of a single-family resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:51| would be overburdening of that easement and would not be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| And at this time, there's three residents, single-family residents, that reside on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| Also in this mix, this piece of property is in among five other houses, three of them less than 50 feet from the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| one within less than 100 feet of the property, and mine is about 100 to 165 feet from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4326)|
| 1:12:17| And also in this private right-of-way, this private right-of-way was created to serve three single-family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:28| The description of this right-of-way was not hidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| This description was in the legal notice in the paper that talks about all the land that lies between this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:40| Sir, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| I'm going to have to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| Your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| You get a three-minute rebuttal, but we've got to go back to Mr. Gordon now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| We feel we have a legal claim on that right-of-way and that any use of that right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| other than the burden imposed by a single-family residence, would not be proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| Mr. Britton, I just wanted to assure you I checked my notes and I've received, this is Commissioner Mark Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| I've received your 11-page facts and I assume the other commissioners did too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| Mr. Gordon, you've got up to three minutes rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| First of all, I don't think that Danny lives at that property, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| Do you live on that property on Oak Ridge Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| When did you move there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| You need to come to the mic, sir, if you're going to answer a question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| You told me you lived at 5033 Loyal Oaks Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| That is my legal mailing address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| But at this time I'm taking residency at 6543 Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| And one of the reasons I'm taking residency there is because I'm taking care of my dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| So that's been within the last couple of months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Now, I understand also that the winding Oak Ridge Highway in both your dad's house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| and that house that you're living in now is going to be taken by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| But when I was eight years old, I've lived on this property now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| and since I was eight years old when I was out there admiring the surveyor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| they have been winding Oak Ridge Highway since that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| And we have no contract and we have no promise that this is going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| Are you in negotiations with the state, Dale, to take those properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| I was in negotiations with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| but now that negotiation has ceased because there's been a change in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:35| Well, at the time we talked, you were not living on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| Two or three months ago when I was up there working on this house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| I was going to remodel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| You were not living on that property at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| We had talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| I'm tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| Why don't you all sit down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| Let's go to the 6th District and see if they can get some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| Commissioner Lambert, Commissioner Cawood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| I'd like to clarify why the zoning of when Mr. Gordon originally put in for his zoning change request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4503)|
| 1:15:11| why it was changed to what we have presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| From CA to PC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| MPC did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| I assumed it would be more restrictive about the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| The original application was for CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| The planning staff and the planning commission voted to recommend planned commercial zoning instead of the CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4531)|
| 1:15:38| because of the extra protection you have with site plan review, with access issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| with things that you can do to make sure the property is developed in a proper fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| I don't think there was any question we had that it shouldn't be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| We just felt like that it should be a planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| There is already a planned zoning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| Granted, it is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| And the reason that planned zoning, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| is in place in part is because of access and also some slope constraints that you have running through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| So this rezoning that we're voting on is, in effect, even more restrictive than what Mr. Gordon had originally asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| This is fine and good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| But, again, the same MPC that I feel did not grant me a postponement on can also come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4585)|
| 1:16:35| and, through use of review process, do whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| Also, if I use the examples of the properties located inside of this property, like Bobcat Dealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| Bobcat Dealer is under the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| It's zoned under the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| But if you go out there and take a look at this property and see all this raw dirt, all this erosion that's taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| and you look at the zoning requirements, I would come to the conclusion that it doesn't meet zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| If I step next door to the one that's county, which I've been filling on for the last three years, there's been concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| block, pavement, there's big puddles that's down in the bottom of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| And if you look at the zoning requirements, it says that, you know, there should be grass and these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| So I don't have the example that says that even with this more restrictive rezoning that it will be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4643)|

| 1:19:45| Why the change to plan residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4785)|

| 1:20:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| I'd also like to ask MPC, there's in the record an indication of sinkholes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4830)|
| 1:20:38| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4838)|
| 1:20:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| As a matter of fact, the Planning Commission has already approved a concept plan subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| to the rezoning being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| And sinkholes were considered and reviewed at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| The plan residential zone is an ideal zone that allows the staff and MPC to review plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| that can do a little bit better job of addressing the idea of sinkholes on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| I believe that in reviewing and in the approval of the concept plan, which again is subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| to this being approved, that those issues were addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| There are two or three conditions from the concept plan approval that will make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| that the sinkholes are protected, that the sinkholes are addressed as the property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| So we feel comfortable with the recommendation and with the concept plan that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| at this past MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4907)|

| 1:22:39| The property is located on the north side of Carmichael Road, west of Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Arthur Seymour, Jr. and Rusty Biddle here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| We're also dealing with the next two issues if you want me to discuss all of those at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| Hardin Valley, the Hardin Valley project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| It's all the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Well, let's read those two into the record so we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Mr. Chairman, we're going to have to end up dividing the question anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| If I may, I will discuss the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| I just, once we get to voting, we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| At one time rather than going separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| Go ahead and read them into the record and then we can divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| These are requests of Hardin Valley Land Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| The first is for Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment from MU Mixed Uses, LDR, Low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| Density Residential, and SLPA Slope Protection to MDR, Medium Density Residential, and SLPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| Slope Protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| The second is for rezoning from BP Business and Technology, TO Technology Overlay, PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| Plan Residential at two dwelling units an acre, TO Technology Overlay, A Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| and TO Technology Overlay, and PC Plan Commercial Condition and Technology Overlay to PR Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:05| Residential at up to 12 dwelling units an acre and TO Technology Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| These requests are located on the northwest side of Carmichael Road, southwest side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| Pellissippi Parkway, southeast of Hardin Valley Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| And let me ask before you start, Mr. Seymour, is there any opposition in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| Go ahead, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| If I may, and I'm going to ask Mr. Biddle if he could just hold this up for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| I want to use this board to discuss this because this is a rather large project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| Our client is developing property from Hardin Valley Road here over to Carmichael Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:46| and to give you the lay of the land, this is Pellissippi Parkway running along here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| at the top of the diagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| There is commercial here on the front at Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| There's office development going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| This is a large mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| We are asking for the residential piece back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| And this dark green property is the subject of the request tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:18| We are asking for the residential portion of this property planned residential at 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| to 12 units per acre, which requires a change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| Since this is in the technology overlay district, we also went to the Tech Carter Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| Authority for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| MPC, when it heard our request, recommended to you all planned residential at 1 to 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| The Tech Carter Development Authority disagreed with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| If I may, planned residential, which we are asking for in a sector plan amendment for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5156)|
| 1:26:02| medium-density residential, only permits the applicant to submit a concept plan for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5162)|
| 1:26:12| at anywhere from 1 up to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| That concept plan then goes to the MPC for a public hearing for review at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5177)|
| 1:26:27| and public input at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| If someone disagrees with what MPC does or the applicant does, it can be brought back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:37| to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| What we are asking for you to do here today is to overrule the action of the Tech Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| Development Authority and approve the recommendation of the MPC that this property be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:55| for medium-density residential and that the zoning be placed on it of planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5215)|
| 1:27:02| at 1 to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| Now, why is this important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| Today, especially along the Tech Carter and Pellissippi area out there, you are seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:15| a lot of mix of office, professional, and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| Today, people want to live near the Pellissippi Parkway because there are a tremendous number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5241)|
| 1:27:28| of jobs available out there in the offices and businesses that are located on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| And secondly, because of the convenience to Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| Most of the people who work in Oak Ridge, where there is a tremendous amount of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| going on now, live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| I think over 50% of the people who work out there live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| This area is also very convenient to the West Knoxville, the shopping there, Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5270)|
| 1:27:58| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| So there is a tremendous desire for residential in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| Now, should we be fortunate enough to see approval for planned residential at 1 to 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| units per acre, let me remind you again that that does not ensure that we will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| to build that number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| We are only asking for the opportunity to look at that before we spend big dollars on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:29| MPC staff noted that there are some drain issues with the property and we acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| That's why we want the planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| You can cluster throughout the flatland and leave the steep slopes undisturbed if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| have the flexibility that the planned residential gives to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| Also, let me say because of the new high school, and you all are aware of it, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| is tremendous desire for people to move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| The new elementary school and the new high school, which is not yet open, have created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| a demand for housing in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| And also, you have Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| So there is a growing demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| But by clustering development in an area like this, you're avoiding pushing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| further west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| We would ask that you approve the MPC recommendation of 1 to 12 units per acre and overrule the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:41| Tech Carter recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| And I'll be happy to answer any questions you all have about this project at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5384)|
| 1:29:52| The office is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| The residential, we hope, will be underway later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| By the way, let me mention one last thing that I forgot to in looking at my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| This new road, Valley Vista Road, that is running off Hardin Valley here, it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| running over to Carmichael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| It will parallel Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| It will eventually run to Yarnell Road right near its intersection with Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5412)|
| 1:30:20| So you'll have a parallel connector between Hardin Valley Road and Lovell Road along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:27| Pellissippi Parkway in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| I have a question, Arthur, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| How big of an area is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| How many acres is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| This is 102 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| So are these going to be single family dwellings or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| Twelve units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| It's 20, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| Twenty-five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Twenty-five acres for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| The whole project is over 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| On this particular piece, what sort of buildings are going to go up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| It will be either upscale apartments or condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5464)|
| 1:31:11| You can build apartments on ten units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| It's been done in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| What sort of square footage is in those apartments, Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| Go ahead, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Like Mr. Seymour said, we're kind of in the planning stages and we'd just like the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| to do the engineering to see if it is feasible at this point is all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| RFID on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| Minimum apartments today or condominiums are running minimum of 1,500 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| and a lot much larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| What we do, if we do do it, will be a very upscale apartment, if it is apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| if that's your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| Our whole development, for that matter, is a very upscale development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| Okay, Commissioner Frank Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| This is a question for Bud Johnson at least to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| Am I gathering that MPC is recommending approval of the sector change in the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| But you represent the MPC, but you also represent the developer corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| and that staff recommendation was to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| And I was just wondering how, on one hand, you can recommend one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| and, on the other hand, recommend something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| And if you can like me and name us, fill in, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| Well, in both cases, the staffs recommended five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| In the case of the tech corridor, they voted to support the staff recommendation at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| In the case of the planning commission, which is a separate body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| they voted to go along with the applicant's request at 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| The tech corridor, in looking at what they do in the land base, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| they have a very specific focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| and that is to try to encourage development in the tech corridor that respects the land area out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| that encourages, where appropriate, intense development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| hopefully primarily office and technology park uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| But as we're seeing now, we're seeing a mix of uses coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| It's fair to say that the staff, as well as the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| is excited about the possibilities for this tract in terms of the full 100-plus acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5600)|
| 1:33:26| In fact, we've had very good discussions with the applicants over the past several months about their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| The one area where the staff in both cases had concerns was the density that was being requested on the 25 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:41| We included some maps in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| There's a colored map in your zoning packet that shows a considerable portion of this site as steep topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| And we're encouraged that the applicant is going to try to stay away from those steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| In fact, any plan that comes in, we would expect to see a plan that respects this topography, regardless of the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5636)|
| 1:34:03| But if you try to place 12 units on that site, if they look at the flatter portions of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| you're going to end up with what appears and what may function as more of a very high-density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| We feel in terms of trying to get a handle and trying to address steep slope and difficult terrain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| you should look very carefully at the zoning stage where you can hopefully get a density that respects that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5661)|
| 1:34:28| We feel that at five to use per acre, if it's placed on the flatter portions of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| you're going to end up with a medium-density development on that portion of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| Granted, the planning commission did go against the staff recommendation on the planning commission vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| and did vote to approve the 12 to use per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| So with that said, you know, the Tech Carter staff, MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:54| and the Tech Carter board had concerns about the amount of density they were trying to put on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| Plus, you've got some very low-density residential developments that are surrounding this further to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:10| that, you know, were a concern as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Commissioner Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| I just want to echo what Mr. Johnson just said as far as the TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| We did vote for up to five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| I'd encourage the commissioners to go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| The corridor board felt very strongly that 12 units an acre was extremely high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:45| and was not in characteristic of the technology corridor overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:52| And I think that, you know, had they come in with maybe a different density between five and 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| maybe there would be something to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| But as Buzz said, when you start clustering that number in the areas where you can build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5761)|
| 1:36:11| where it's more level, I think you have a situation here that you've got a road that the width of Carmichael,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:20| not very good, and I think we need to uphold what staff recommended and what the TTCDA said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| Ms. Shoup, did you have something to add to the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5793)|
| 1:36:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| I just wanted to reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| My name is Teresa Shoup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| I'm at 12168 Warrior Trail in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| and I'm also a commissioner on the Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| I wanted to make a brief statement to support both what the staff has said today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| that of one to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| and what Commissioner Luthold has told you about what TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| The commissioners on TTCDA took a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| took it very seriously to review this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| and their recommendation we hope is respected by this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| and their authority to make those recommendations respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| One point I want to make, the clustering is supported in either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| The idea of clustering is wonderful here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| This is a steep site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| Sixty-seven percent of this site is in steep slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| and so the five dwelling units would have to be clustered onto the flat areas already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| The concern is if you go up to the 12 dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| how much of that steep area are you going to err into and how dense will it get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| Basically, you're talking a difference between 125 maximum units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| versus 300 maximum units to be clustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| And so clustering is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| Both of these proposals talk about clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| It's just how much you're going to be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Well, first, I just want to commend the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| The Biddles have been valuable members of that community for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| In fact, Mr. H.E. Biddle served on the state legislator for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| And I'll have to say, Mr. Biddle, I owe my life to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| You're championing the handgun carry permit law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| and I think Senator Birch had handled that on the Senate side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| I recently, unfortunately, had an opportunity to where I had to utilize my handgun carry permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| and I feel like I wouldn't be here today were it not for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| I also feel like, like I said, these are good neighbors in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| highly respected folks that held political office for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| and I don't think that they're going to put anything in that community that the neighbors are not going to like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:14| This also looks like the type of clustered, mixed-use type development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| that the spirit of the Tech Corridor was designed to uphold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| to encourage those modern areas where you can work very close to your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| And so I'm going to bring the motion that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Your motion is to approve up to 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| You want a motion to uphold the appeal for one to 12 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| Yes, to uphold the appeal for one to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| Okay. Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| Second by Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| Is this on the Tennessee technology item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=5996)|

| 1:40:35| Anybody else voting no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| Commissioner Craig Luthode voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| Okay. Got everybody's no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| 14 ayes and five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| So the appeal is upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| We're on to the top of page 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| Okay. We need a motion from the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| We uphold the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6067)|

| 1:41:12| Okay. I'll bring the motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6072)|

| 1:41:38| Okay. On the third request, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| I move we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6104)|

| 1:41:46| For MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| Seconded by Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6109)|

| 1:41:58| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| The vote is 18 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| And the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| Okay. We're on zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070226part2?start=6124)|
