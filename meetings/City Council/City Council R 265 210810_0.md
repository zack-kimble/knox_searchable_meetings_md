| 0:02:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=178)|

| 0:03:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| I'd like to ask for a postponement to the August 24th meeting for items 10A and 12G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| These have to do with the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| One of the parties' attorney was not able to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| We did have a meeting last week, which was very productive, and there are some more renderings that we're waiting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| But since one of the parties won't be able to be represented tonight, I'd ask for that postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| Until what date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=215)|

| 0:03:58| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=239)|

| 0:04:09| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=249)|

| 0:04:12| You want me to give you a date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| That's August 24th, and that's two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| September 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| I think it's good for the record to have the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| One, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| September 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=266)|

| 0:04:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Motion to postpone carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Any other items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Council Member Ryder, your light's still on, or do you have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=295)|

| 0:05:04| Oh, next is consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Is there a motion on the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Oh, there are no consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| I have a report for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Let me start by thanking all of our Council Members for wearing masks tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| None of us like to wear masks, but we all like to do our part to keep the community healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| So I appreciate everybody doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| Since the last time we were all together, we have seen significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases locally and across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| Our youngest residents, under 12, are not eligible for vaccinations, so they are among the most vulnerable in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| and as you know, have been returning to school this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| Occasionally, there are breakthrough cases being reported, so despite our vaccination status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| we are following the CDC guidance and asking people to wear masks in city offices and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| It is up to each of us to do our part to help protect our community from this deadly disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| So thank you for doing your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| As I just alluded to, most schools in our area just had their first full day of classes today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| Normally, this is an exciting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| But sadly, the Austinese community is once again mourning the loss of another student to senseless gun violence over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| As we keep the AE family, and in particular the family of the young man who died, in our thoughts and prayers, let's be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=384)|
| 0:06:32| This level of violence that we have seen this year is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| It's not unique to Knoxville, and it's driven by many factors, but it's not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| We cannot have this type of violent crime become the norm for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| So I want to let you know what Chief Thomas and I are doing about this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| First, examining alternate work schedules for all available sworn officers in order to maximize the number of available officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=410)|
| 0:06:59| and the KPD's ability to respond to serious criminal matters and violent incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| Second, we are considering eliminating the response of officers to non-emergency or non-injury crashes that are not blocking the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=425)|
| 0:07:13| This could free up officers to respond to calls that require immediate police presence or intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| Third, I want to share an announcement that the East Tennessee Valley Crime Stoppers Executive Board has taken emergency action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=439)|
| 0:07:28| and voted to double the maximum reward from $1,000 to $2,000 for tipsters who provide credible information in relation to the shooting that occurred on Sunday morning in Lonsdale Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=448)|
| 0:07:39| Hopefully, this additional reward will help garner more tips in this case and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| Let me be clear, Crime Stoppers and many of the violence interruption initiatives we have already started are just some of the tools to help us with this critical work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=464)|
| 0:07:53| We've done a lot already. We are actively ramping up our efforts in this space and I hope to be able to announce more soon about our approach to this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| So the bottom line, like I know all of you are thinking about this all the time, our violence is something that's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| It's on my mind 24-7. It's a top priority for my entire leadership team as we work to address challenges of crime and violence in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=489)|
| 0:08:18| So, thank you for that, listening to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| Before we move on with our meeting, change of topic, I want to take a moment to recognize the city's finance team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| The finance department has been awarded the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award for the 32nd year in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| This is from the Government Finance Officers Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| So, this award reflects the commitment to transparency and clear communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| And even during a time of great tumult and challenges in our community, I want to just publicly congratulate our chief financial officer, Susan Janot, and her entire team in the finance department for earning this award again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=523)|
| 0:08:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=538)|

| 0:09:54| Are there any reports of council members or committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| As some of you might know, I was born in India and I became a U.S. citizen when I was 13 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| And India's Independence Day is coming up next week, August 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| Also from the British, so there's some similarities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| But I have, so my parents came here and had the struggle of trying to learn this culture and how to move through a completely different world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=615)|
| 0:10:25| And there are a lot of, there are about 40,000 international or recent immigrants in the Knox County area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=625)|
| 0:10:33| And of course, most importantly, we are all of, almost all of us are of, our ancestry is immigrant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| So I've asked Janie Whaley to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| She's from Knoxville Immigrant Neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=643)|
| 0:10:51| Ms. Whaley, if you could just state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| My name is Janie Whaley and my address is 6300 Queen Hill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=655)|
| 0:11:04| And especially because of the mask, if you could speak really closely into the microphone so we can all hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| All right. Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| I think so. Is it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| No. It doesn't sound like it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Is the microphone on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| I don't think it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| It's on? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| It sort of sounds like it's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| Try now. Try now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| It's not plugged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Okay, please. I think it's fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Apparently I have inadvertently pressed a mute button, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| I didn't know I could do that, but it's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| Okay, Ms. Whaley, I think that microphone's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| If you want to try it one more time at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| This one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Just give it a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| It's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| You got my address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Okay. Thank you very much for allowing me the time to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| Like I said, my name's Janie Whaley, and I'm the executive director of Knoxville Internationals Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=731)|
| 0:12:19| also known as KIN, K-I-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| And what we do is we help the internationals by connecting them to like-minded partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| to empower relationships that embrace cultures and encourage unity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=750)|
| 0:12:38| All right, we work with all types of internationals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| refugees, asylees, SIVs, international students, employers and employees that come here to Knoxville to better their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=761)|
| 0:12:56| Now, so many of them come and they can't speak the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| You all talked about the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Have you seen an Arabic person understand how important the vaccine is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| They're scared to death of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| They don't understand American government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| Honestly, they don't trust American government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| So what we do at KIN is we partner with people like the health department, gather the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=798)|
| 0:13:26| put it into a language, like an Arabic language, make videos, distribute flyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| so that they can understand what it is that the American government is asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| So many of them don't know the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| They don't know how to get jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| They don't know how to navigate the health care system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| They don't know how to enroll their children in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| So what we do is we come alongside them, and as a network, all of you got this little sheet here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=832)|
| 0:14:00| As a network, we partner with hundreds of different partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| We partner with other nonprofits and government organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| When the internationals call us and say, I need help finding a doctor, I need help finding out what school my child goes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=851)|
| 0:14:21| we connect them to the resources that can help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| There's no sense in duplicating services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| There are hundreds of nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| So we're not going to do something that other people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| If they need a job, we send them over to the Knoxville Area Urban League or the American Job Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| If they need help with their utilities, we send them over to CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| And we do more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| We take them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| We handhold them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Because if you tell someone who speaks German, you say, go down to the CAC and ask them for help with your utility bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=890)|
| 0:15:01| they're going to look at you and say, CAC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| And they're not going to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| So we also have volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| We've got over 300 volunteers that work with us, volunteer their time with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| so that we can pair up a volunteer with an international or with an international family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| They walk alongside them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| It's like a big brother, big sister program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| They teach them how to change their batteries in their smoke detector or how to use an electric stove versus a propane stove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=925)|
| 0:15:33| They teach them how to turn a thermostat on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| How many of them come from refugee camps that don't even know how to use an electric thermostat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| So these are our American citizens, our Knoxvillians, and they have a purpose here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| They show promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| They're not here by choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| The refugees did not choose to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| They just wanted out of their country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| And so we value what God has given them as far as talent, abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=962)|
| 0:16:10| I'll tell you just from working with them for four years now, they don't like being on welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| They don't like charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| They don't like handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| They want to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| And, I mean, right now we've got an aerospace engineer from Venezuela, and he's mopping floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=982)|
| 0:16:31| We have an architect from Sweden, and he's working at Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| Now, couldn't we use these people to better Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| So that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| We have an employment coach on staff that works with them, fixes their resume, and gets them into the position that they were educated for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| So, basically, I just want to let you know that we exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| We're here to help the internationals integrate into Knoxville, which is going to make, in turn, Knoxville a much better place, a blessed place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1020)|
| 0:17:14| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you, Ms. Whaley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Oh, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Oh, I do have one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| I gave you this big sheet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| Knoxville Internationals Network is having a birthday party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| We're going to be seven years old as a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| And I know you haven't heard about us for a long time, but things are changing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| And as more refugees are coming in, and we work with them for as long as they need us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| And so we're having a big old birthday party, and we'd really like to invite all of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| We'd like to invite the press, wherever the press is, and just come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| We're going to have international music, international dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| We're going to have birthday cake, prizes, and just a fun time, just to let you all know how much we appreciate the support that Knoxville has given Ken, which, in turn, can support the internationals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1075)|
| 0:18:09| Thank you, Ms. Whaley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| I was just going to apologize for getting the name wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| And thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| When my parents came here, they spoke English, but they didn't know how to work the thermostat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| They didn't know how to use the stove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| And there were people that they had to rely on to get those things done, and now they're doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| It takes a village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Council Member Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Council Members, I am your elected representative to serve on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| You don't remember that, but at one of these meetings, you elected me to be your representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| And I'm not really good at making a report about our pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| So I have asked Dennis Owen, who is an appointed citizen to serve, to give you all just a quick update about what's going on with the pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1134)|
| 0:19:04| And Christy Pakowski is also in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| She is the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| If you have lots of questions, it might be helpful for us to have a workshop sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| But we've just finished the fiscal year, and although the audit's not done, I ask Dennis to kindly come give us a few updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| He manages money for a living, so he's more qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Thanks, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Yeah, and if you could just state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| I'm Dennis Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| I live at 428 Kittowa Trail here in the city, and I'm one of the appointees of the mayor to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1174)|
| 0:19:42| And I'll be brief tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| I know you've got a lot on your plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| And first of all, feel free to mute me any time because I'm used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| You can't hurt my feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| So let me tell you a little bit about, and again, I'll be brief, what we do, who we are, and maybe brief you on some of the things that are happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1193)|
| 0:20:04| Our job, the responsibility of the pension board is to administer the plan that provides pension benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1204)|
| 0:20:14| retiree benefits, and disability benefits to city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| That's it in a nutshell, and that's the biggest, that's one of the largest oversimplifications in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1219)|
| 0:20:26| But that is essentially what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Another big part of the pension board is to manage the investments that, or actually to administer the investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1229)|
| 0:20:38| and administer the managers of the assets that are in the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| I'm very pleased to announce for the first time in the history of the pension board, we have over $700 million in the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| And it's a very big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| I can tell you that it's taken very seriously and very professionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| And I'll try to address a couple of those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Please interrupt me at any time and ask questions, easy ones, and if there are hard ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| Christy's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| The portfolio I would describe as, and I've been in the business for 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| I would describe the portfolio of our pension plan as reasonably conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| And by reasonably conservative, I mean that we're probably pretty much in line with what you would expect to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| in a municipal pension plan of a city our size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| If you were to take a look at every investment in the portfolio, every position that we have from A to Z, it would not surprise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| So with that in mind, I would say I'm from the investment background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1299)|
| 0:21:47| I have an investment background, so I've got to talk about performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| It's a wonderful time to talk about performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| But let me take you back to the second quarter of 2020, just when the pandemic was starting to have an effect on the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1314)|
| 0:22:02| and it wasn't just a headline anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| It was a powerful thing that was happening in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| The second quarter was nasty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| It was gruesome in the financial markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| We took a hit, just like everybody else did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| I'm also pleased to tell you that we rebounded quite robustly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| Robustly is a generic term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Let me give you a specific term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| We're up 22 percent second quarter to second quarter of 2020, second quarter to 2001, second quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1348)|
| 0:22:40| With a disclaimer, those are accurate numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| I stand behind them, but they are not audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| So our audit, I think, is due in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| But up over 20 percent in the last, from June 30 to June 30, and over 700 million in assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1369)|
| 0:22:58| So any questions so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| As Councilwoman Fugate mentioned, Christy Pakowski is our executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| And if you know her, you know that she does a terrific job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| She's very sensitive to the needs of the employees of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| And you also know that she knows the rules, the bylaws, the charters, everything that has to do with our plan like the back of her hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1399)|
| 0:23:28| She's a terrific resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| She handles the job well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| It's a highly complex organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| We deal with auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| We deal with, or they deal with, actuaries, investment managers, trustees, custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| So there's a lot of moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| It's highly legalistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| But they are able, Christy, the staff of the pension office, our outside counsel, Kathy Aislinger, they are able to stay under the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1428)|
| 0:24:00| They keep a fairly low profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| And that's a good thing because the last thing you all want to do is wake up tomorrow morning and read a story about the pension board from Knox News or Compass or Betty B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1443)|
| 0:24:15| You just don't want to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| So what else can I mention that I want to talk about the composition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| You all probably know how the composition of the pension board is made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| And you all decided this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| So there are nine of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| Mayor Ken Cannon is, of course, on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| So is Susan Janot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| And four employees of the city are on the pension board, four employees that are elected, who are elected by city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1480)|
| 0:24:50| One is a representative of the fire department, one from KPD, and the other two are from the general government population, from employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1490)|
| 0:25:00| So it's a good group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| You all chose to have Mrs. Fugate, Councilwoman Fugate, which I think is a great choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| There are two of us that are appointed by the mayor, non-city employees on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| I'm one of them, and Twanna Monroe is the other appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| So that's nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| That's nine folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| We meet once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| We would love for you to join us any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| And any more details on that, I'll be happy to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| But it's a great team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| This is my second term on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| And it's really a good team because they take their job seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| They're fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| And that's not because they want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| It's because they're fiduciaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| We're actually sworn in as fiduciaries on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| And, of course, you know what a fiduciary is, meaning that every action that we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| and every decision that's made at those meetings has to be done with the best interest of the plan in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1556)|
| 0:26:05| That's what a fiduciary does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| That's what we're required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| And it's a good team to do what we're required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| So let me see if there's anything else I'm supposed to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| My glasses are fogged up, so I'm having to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Any easy ones for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Thank you for allowing me to update you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| I was just going to say thank you, Dennis, for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Don't you all trust him more than me telling you all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| So I really do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| And I just thought that we haven't talked about the pension in a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| and thought I should give you an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| So there you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| And if you want to know more, we can schedule something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| As a matter of fact, Christy is at 215-1444 if you have other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you, Mr. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| I just want to announce that on September 25th, Popular Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| that there will be a job hiring fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1631)|

| 0:27:45| The other thing I wanted to draw everybody's attention to is that the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| in a partnership with Trees Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| recently completed an urban tree canopy assessment for the first time in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Maybe ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| They compared the tree canopy across the city from 2008 to 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| And so for a lot of districts all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| that tree canopy is really important, particularly for the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| And we need to preserve it as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| So it's a really good report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| It's available on the city's website, on the city's urban forestry webpage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| So it's a very detailed report about what tree coverage we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| where there's too much concrete, where there's not enough trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| where we've lost trees, and where we need to preserve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| So it's extremely important to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| I encourage everybody to utilize that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1711)|

| 0:29:37| but they do need our assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1777)|

| 0:30:04| that are really being affected by this increase in violence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1804)|

| 0:33:01| Will had penned out a packet to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| I hate to have the last-minute information, but some of the information became relevant with a meeting that we had last Tuesday with zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1985)|
| 0:33:14| and engineering and building inspectors on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| It was Adam from stormwater engineering, James Tennant from building inspectors, and Scott Elder from zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=1999)|
| 0:33:29| With Andrew, our city councilman was present to discuss any situations that could happen with the property to try to make everything happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2009)|
| 0:33:38| I do like to thank all the council members that got to come out to see the property to kind of learn about the history and what goes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| It's been there for 64 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| Inside the packet, page one is basically the brief kind of history of the outline of what we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2028)|
| 0:33:57| If you got to come to the property, everyone, I believe, got this information to review when they took home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| Page two in the packet is from the original application packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| It's the KEB letter that kind of drew my attention was the recommendation from the Glenmore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| where the planning commission sends out to all departments to learn about easements, learn about plots, anything that evolves in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2056)|
| 0:34:24| It's kind of in discovery that that email, I mean, actually, sorry, it's page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| That KEB email was basically, it seems like it's a form letter, and it said that there was enclosed prints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2072)|
| 0:34:41| I cannot find any enclosed prints from KEB in the original packet, the appeal packet that every council member got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2081)|
| 0:34:50| And the curiosity became, as was on page four of the packet we gave you, the whole application process, the postponement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2090)|
| 0:34:59| everything to deal with the street was all based on setting up a public easement down the middle of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| because pedestrians like to use it to enter to the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| That was all supposed to be discussed with planning, engineering, zoning, any parties available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| But what we discovered in the meeting last Tuesday was there's actually an easement already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| as highlighted in blue, right down the middle of Glenmore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| There's a KEB sewer line, which is technically a 15-foot wide easement that is in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| that we did not know about for the last couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| until the gentleman from Stormwater gave me this map on last Tuesday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| So that kind of leads us up to, on page five, the main denial of the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| was based on wanting to expand and maybe a future entrance into the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| from a meeting that was held on 521 with planning staff, engineering, parks and rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| That meeting I was supposed to be able to attend to cover any ideas, cover any aspects of an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| cover any questions that might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| On 517, I was denied that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| They told me it was going to be an internal meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| Then they came back with the recommendation to deny my application for future reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| I contacted Cheryl Ely with Parks and Rec Department to inform her what she knew about this, different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2184)|
| 0:36:32| I'm not sure if she's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| She was going to try to make it two weeks ago before the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| But on the bottom of page five, the main thing in bold was she left a voicemail with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| This is a transcript of the voicemail that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| I'm not really sure how that all became and happened during that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| but again, we don't have an issue with you all having the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| And the voicemail was basically saying we're not going to develop anything in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| and we're not sure how that happened in our phone conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| I'm not sure if she's here tonight or not to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| On page six, another part of the reason they denied my application was ADA compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| We did the slope of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| It's less than 1% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| Engineering came back and said it had to be ADA compliant, which ADA compliance is over 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| That was all discussed with Stephanie Cook from the ADA office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| and I haven't got a definite answer back from her yet on that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| The other information is basically all of the e-mails back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| It's from page eight through 21, between planning and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| to discuss how everything was supposed to be set up from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| And thank you for my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| It looks like I ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Next person signed up to speak in favor of this item is Dawn Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| Ms. Clark, if you could approach the podium and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| My name is Dawn Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| I live at 7916 Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| One of the things that we discovered was that the planning staff did not seem to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| all the correct information to the committee before the vote was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| There was a lot of information that was left out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| and we feel like that the vote happened without them being fully aware of all the information, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2305)|
| 0:38:35| At no point in time did the planning staff mention anything about the neighbors that we have that were in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2315)|
| 0:38:45| Everything seemed to focus on there's so much opposition against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| There was more support for closing the street than there was for keeping it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| One of the letters from Ken Spafford, he is a neighbor that lives across the street from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| He has two small children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| He utilizes the street to go in and out of the park all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| He put a letter in as support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| It says, I have read the objections posted online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| Most of these appear to be based on a misunderstanding that neighborhood residents would lose access to the park via Glenmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| We never had any intention of blocking anyone's use of that street to go in and out of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2372)|
| 0:39:40| We really just needed it closed because of the zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| We went through all the stages, all the recommendations from start to finish on what we were supposed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| to take care of the problem that we created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| We know we did it after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| We were unaware of the zoning rules when this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2400)|
| 0:40:09| We are now fully aware of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| So becoming aware of them, we went through all the recommendations that were given to us by our city councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| by all the city officials that we spoke to, to take care of the issue and to fix it, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2417)|
| 0:40:28| I'm really not sure what else to say other than there's more support from our neighbors for closing the street than there was opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2428)|
| 0:40:37| The majority of the neighbors are in support of closing that street due to safety issues that have come up over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2437)|
| 0:40:48| When we first moved in 21 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| we found out inadvertently that there were drug deals happening on the end of the dead-end street right at the park boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2452)|
| 0:41:00| KUB put up a street light and took care of that so there was no more just complete darkness at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2460)|
| 0:41:09| There's been a continuous problem with people parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| It's a no-parking tollway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| People utilize it all the time to go in and out of the park, park their cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| because they don't want to go to the main entrances on both ends of the park and use the parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2478)|
| 0:41:26| We've had people drive through our yards to drive into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| We've had people drive into the neighbors' yards to drive into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| We've had drug deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| We've had concerns with criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| Both of the neighbors' houses on either side of us have been broken into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| My car has been broken into at least three times in my own driveway that I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2508)|
| 0:41:56| I've had a rock thrown through my window because I stopped someone from driving across the pipeline and asked them not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| So what we really would like to ask the city is to close the street and just make it our driveways instead of a public street that's on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2524)|
| 0:42:15| Google has it on their map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| Waze has it on their map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| And it directed everybody and their brother into that street last spring when everybody shut down, the pandemic started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2538)|
| 0:42:26| Nobody had anywhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Everybody decided to go to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| And there was anywhere from 75 to 100 cars pulling down in that street a day, turning around and backing out and turning around and backing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2551)|
| 0:42:40| When you have people walking in and out of the street, our neighbors around us walking in and out of the park using that street for access, it becomes a real safety issue when you've got children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2560)|
| 0:42:54| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| Thank you, Ms. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| The next person signed up to speak on this is Joseph Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| Mr. Clark, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| My name is Joseph Allen Clark, and my current permanent address is 7916 Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2591)|
| 0:43:27| Honestly, I don't know what to say anymore after all of this that's come out and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2607)|
| 0:43:36| This was supposed to be a simple close and shut case, and I'm not a very good public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2616)|
| 0:43:43| I have ADD, and I'm a really bad introvert, so I'm sorry if I say something not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| But all of the opposition that had come out do not border the dead-end street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2630)|
| 0:43:59| They are up to five houses away, most of which border the park itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| And none of them have had to deal with the issues save one, Kent Fugate, who lives across the street from us, and that was last week, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2645)|
| 0:44:16| And I don't want to say anything. I'm not going to say anything against them as people, because they have been nice people for a majority of my life, every single one of them that I've met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2656)|
| 0:44:28| And that's going to be it. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Council, there's one person signed up to speak in opposition of this item, Ken Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| Please approach the podium, get your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2688)|
| 0:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| My name is Ken Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| I live at 8016 Bennington Drive, four houses down from Glenmore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| In his appeal, Mr. Clark gives two reasons for why he wants Glenmore Drive closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| One, he says that it is a hardship to the way he wants to use his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| And the second reason he gives is that he says the West Hills Community Association favors his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| So I'll take the second point first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| The West Hills Community Association does not favor his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| In fact, Mr. Clark, along with many of his neighbors, received an e-mail from the president of the West Hills Community Association explicitly saying that that association was not taking a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2731)|
| 0:45:44| It was going to remain neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| So it is simply not true to say that that association supports Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| I would also challenge whether it's actually a majority of people, but I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| I haven't gone door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| I'm not sure the clerks can speak accurately about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| In any event, but the main reason that we're here is that Mr. Clark says that it's a hardship for how he wants to use his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2760)|
| 0:46:11| And what he really means is that his wife teaches swimming lessons in the backyard, in the pool, the huge pool in that backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| And they would like to have the fence, which violates city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| That's the reason that we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| For one citizen's private commercial interest wants public land to be given to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| We think that's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| And really that's the reason that we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| As far as the other reasons that have been tossed up about crime, well, I pulled the police reports for the last five years, and there were all of three calls made that had anything to do with crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2799)|
| 0:46:53| So I'd say three calls in five years isn't a very impressive, not really giving a sense that there's a crime problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| And if there were, I'm not sure why closing the street has anything to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| In fact, a police officer who drove by during our community meeting last Thursday was specifically asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2826)|
| 0:47:15| does it make any difference to you to KPD report up responding to a call if it's private land or public land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| And the police officer said it makes no difference whether it's private or public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| So what it comes back to is that you're being asked to overturn a unanimous decision by the planning commission that looked into all the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2847)|
| 0:47:38| that had a staff that made a recommendation, and basically a private citizen wants to have public land turned over to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2858)|
| 0:47:47| We think that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Now there's an opportunity for people supporting the appeal to have a rebuttal by one person of up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2872)|
| 0:48:00| Is anyone from the Clark family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2880)|
| 0:48:10| Do you want me to state my name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| No, we know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| I would like to address these things one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| The West Hills Community Association, after the application was denied, was in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2898)|
| 0:48:27| I don't know where Mr. Brown says that they are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| Recently, after the developments in Andrews and the political fire that that was, was so heavily brought against, they decided that they were in favor, but loosely in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2910)|
| 0:48:46| I would also like to address that some lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| We do not run a business out of our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| Last year it was COVID in the summer, and my mother worked at home like most of us did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| Every swim lesson that she has taught this year has been either at Green Meadows Country Club or on house calls to other people's pools on their private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2940)|
| 0:49:10| So swim lessons have not happened at this pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| We are not running a business out of our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| The crime problem, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2958)|
| 0:49:27| Five years is not an accurate description of crime on a street, in my opinion, because it comes in waves, as I've seen in Johnson City at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2967)|
| 0:49:38| So I don't think five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| The majority of the street has signed off on the decision to close the street, and it is not for reasons of public gain of public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2982)|
| 0:49:52| It is for safety concerns, and everyone at the meeting Wednesday that was in favor of the closing of the street stated that they were in favor of closing the street for safety reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=2992)|
| 0:50:04| that it is not safe because people whip into that driveway, into that dead end street, going 30 plus miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3004)|
| 0:50:12| That concludes your time. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| I want to start off by thanking all the neighbors who came out and met last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| I definitely want to thank my colleagues for the postponement that allowed us last week to have a gathering and get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| I definitely want to thank the Clarks for hosting me over at their house for, I think, more days than they were expecting to in this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3035)|
| 0:50:46| So I do appreciate their hospitality in doing and going over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| I also want to thank Director Ahrens and his group from Plans Review and Inspection who did come out on Tuesday and walk with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3051)|
| 0:51:00| In our meeting and our discussion with Plans Review, it was determined that the issue with the pool in the backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3060)|
| 0:51:13| if the pool is to be moved 8 to 12 feet to the center of the lot, once it gets outside of that corner side yard, then the pool would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3073)|
| 0:51:23| The fence is a different story, and there would need to be a variance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| In the discussions that we had with the neighborhood when everyone came out, there were a lot of things that everyone agreed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| and we heard some of those things tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| The neighbors all agree, and the Clarks agree too, that maintaining pedestrian access into the park from Glenmore Drive is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3101)|
| 0:51:51| Everyone also agreed that they don't want to see traffic increased on Bennington, and they don't want to see parking on Glenmore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3111)|
| 0:52:01| One of the things that I looked at when reviewing this in person was just how long the street is and if there's anything close to the same situation as we see on Glenmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3121)|
| 0:52:14| There's more than 80 feet or about that much from the driveways of these folks' driveways that have driveways associated with Glenmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3134)|
| 0:52:28| There's more than 80 feet going back to the end of Glenmore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| That's a pretty big chunk of real estate, and it creates a lot of space for some of the issues that folks are talking about here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3151)|
| 0:52:39| with parking and with maybe people getting confused about what's going on with that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3159)|
| 0:52:47| About 600 feet down Bennington from this property is another location with a similar street called Churchill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| There, there's only 31 feet from the driveways to the end of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| I just wanted to give you that image so you could see that as we were going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| I did have some questions that I asked Director Ahrens, but I know Deputy to the Mayor Bryce, Director Ahrens is not going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3185)|
| 0:53:15| so I think maybe you can help me or Director Cannon can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| One of the questions that came up in the meeting with the neighbors was if the road was closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| and there was an easement provided for pedestrian access into the park from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3205)|
| 0:53:32| who would be responsible for the upkeep of that and repair of that easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| Mr. Cannon is going to answer these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Thank you, Apparel Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| The easement itself, if it was improved as a pedestrian way, then that would be a city responsibility to maintain that accessway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3226)|
| 0:53:56| If it is just an easement and is not improved, or I'll say up to the point that it is improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3236)|
| 0:54:04| then typically the property owners themselves take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| What I got from Mr. Ahrens was the property owners would be the ones who were responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| if there was an easement for pedestrian access into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| Is there a difference of opinion there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| If it's grasped and it is not improved, then it is the property owner's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| However, if we provide a constructed public accessway along that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| then it would be like other sidewalks and greenways in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| I would take that to be our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| Mr. Swanson could elaborate on the legalities of that, but I believe I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| Just like an easement across any property that we don't own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| once we make improvements, we're responsible for those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| I think how that easement would be structured would be important to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| regarding what the neighborhood would like out of that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| To be clear, if the road was closed and it becomes a private property of the neighbors next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3304)|
| 0:55:12| and the city doesn't come in to make any kind of improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| then it would be the property owner's responsibility to keep that easement open and updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3315)|
| 0:55:25| It would be their responsibility to maintain the property that that easement is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| If the road was closed, this came up several times too, what could be parked there as it's closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3332)|
| 0:55:42| If it's closed? Technically nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| I really wish Director Aarons was here because the answers I'm getting from him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| are different than I'm getting here at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| If the property is closed, it's divided down the middle, goes to either owner on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| I think it depends on what they're parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| Are you saying could they park a vehicle, could they park their boat? Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| What he sent me was that a commercial vehicle could be parked there, a school bus could be parked there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| It would basically be a driveway for someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| You would be limited by the number of axles that a truck could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Whatever would be applicable to that zone and zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Councilman, I apologize. I thought you were talking about private vehicles other than the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| Property owners would have that right if the right-of-way is closed and needed to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| That would be their yard, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| So the property owners would be able to have a lot more access to parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| than they would otherwise be able to have if it remains a public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| It would be their yard, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3418)|
| 0:57:09| I understand also what was being discussed by the applicants about some of the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3429)|
| 0:57:20| that was in the planning commission work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3440)|
| 0:57:30| Can you talk a little bit, Director, about the issues with what was in the reports that planning saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3450)|
| 0:57:38| whether there was actually a plan for Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| whether there was a plan for this road to eventually become a driveway to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3462)|
| 0:57:50| or a road to go to a parking lot into the park, or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Director Brooks, if you could just state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Amy Brooks, Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| There are no plans that we are aware of for future improvement to this access point to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3484)|
| 0:58:12| I want to clarify that defined access, as referenced in the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| is not meant to mean parking or vehicular access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| but a more defined entry for individuals arriving on foot, on bike, from the neighborhood itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3500)|
| 0:58:28| It was an access point for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| We by no means meant that there was any kind of future plan that we were aware of for access to this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3511)|
| 0:58:45| Director Cannon, are there any plans with engineering to put up dead end signs or no parking signs in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3525)|
| 0:58:55| A request is made, and that work order has been scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| Subject to the action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| Is Director Ely here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| Yes, she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Ely's in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| Director Ely, can we chat for a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3553)|
| 0:59:22| The way I see this also is that we have a group of neighbors that want to keep the street public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3562)|
| 0:59:31| but then we also have folks right there nearby who are concerned about issues regarding traffic that's going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3571)|
| 0:59:39| and I've heard that from lots of folks, traffic going in, parking that's being done, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| And this is a very long length of road compared to its sister street nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3585)|
| 0:59:53| So one thought that I wanted to check with you on is would it be something that the parks would be willing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3593)|
| 1:00:02| to maybe put up some parking bollards, shorten the length of Glenmore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| make it so it's only pedestrian access, and that coupled with the signs, no parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| and the dead end signs that Director Cannon just discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| would that be something that the parks department would be willing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| and make that into a pedestrian pathway into the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| Yes, Cheryl Ely, Director of Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Yes, sir, that would be something that we'll be willing to do if that's what the neighborhood is willing to access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| We just wanted to make sure that there was truly an access point into the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| and we don't use it to drive into it right now anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| We didn't have a need or a plan to drive in at any point in time or have a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| So if it is putting bollards in to still allow people in and out of the park, I think that's a win for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3645)|
| 1:00:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| You know, I'm a little uncomfortable with closing the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| giving that there's a fix that we could do that achieves all the goals that the neighbors surrounding want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| but, you know, with regard to parking and with regard to pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| So certainly I'll turn it over to my colleagues to ask any questions they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| but it does seem like we have a less restrictive option here to achieve the goals of what the community was asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3675)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| I did go out to Glenmore Drive, and I spent quite a bit of time with the Clark family looking at and assessing that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3690)|
| 1:01:39| and, you know, there are definitely some complexities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| One question I do have for the Clarks, and I ask this respectfully, is in 2015 you had an issue with the pool in the backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3706)|
| 1:01:55| and were asked to remove it, and then I guess, again, in 2020 or 2021, whenever you added this pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| did it not occur that there were, again, going to need to be some permit requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| Yes, once again, I'm Richard Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| As I said, in 2015 my daughter had bought a 10-foot, what they call like a dog pool for her big Newfoundland dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| She did set it up next to our driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| It was just a circle round pool that you snap together that the dog was playing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| A zoning official driving through the neighborhood saw the pool there beside our driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| pulled in and says, you have to have a fence around a pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| We said, well, okay, we're not going to build a fence around a 10-foot pool that the dog is using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3757)|
| 1:02:45| That was taken down, tossed through the way because it was just a pool for the dog to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3765)|
| 1:02:53| That kind of led, I guess, to my misunderstanding of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| When we did put up a fence, we put up a similar, it's above ground pool that is like waist deep compared to that pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3777)|
| 1:03:07| In the planning meetings and agenda meetings, it was stated that I installed the exact same pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| It's not some of you all saw the pool that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| It's not a 10-foot round dog pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| They did have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| Good thing you added the fence, obviously, with no permitting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| When we erected the fence, we put it back exactly where the old chain link fence was on the property line and did all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3810)|
| 1:03:39| not knowing that our backyard was considered a front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| Most of us have seen when we came out there to the site that we didn't learn that there was a height restriction on a fence in a front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3824)|
| 1:03:53| because of the name City Street makes us have two front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| With the elimination, should the street be eliminated, I suppose that would alleviate the fact that it's a corner yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3838)|
| 1:04:09| and would, hence, become the backyard as it really is, I mean, theoretically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| So, Director Cannon, can you tell me why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| I mean, it is 80 feet or however long it is, but at the same time, it's a street to nowhere other than the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3864)|
| 1:04:33| but it's not a continuation from elsewhere, and it just seems a bit arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| Director Cannon, can you tell me why, in fact, we would need to keep the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3880)|
| 1:04:50| We're discussing. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Oh, you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| I may stay down here for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| I'm sorry, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| I was just asking you, can you tell me why, in fact, we would need to keep the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| and also, you know, if it's closed, really the only change would be to remove the street sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| and to take it off the mapping, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Councilwoman, this situation is not unusual throughout the city, fortunately or unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3916)|
| 1:05:24| We have what I would call stub right-of-ways that are not improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| If I understand your question correctly, I do not see, in that Parks and Recreation has no intention of this being a vehicular access into their park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3930)|
| 1:05:42| that the neighborhood and Parks and Recreation desire to have a pedestrian access, which we can address by way of easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3942)|
| 1:05:54| Very respectfully, I see no benefit to the city keeping this right-of-way as a public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3954)|
| 1:06:02| I see a liability, if nothing else, a maintenance liability to the city in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3962)|
| 1:06:12| I hope I'm answering your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Sure. No, that's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| So my question is to whomever, and this may be a legal question as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| could we, again, the recommendation for an access easement has come up to continue to allow for pedestrian or bicycling right-of-way for the neighborhood and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3981)|
| 1:06:36| I know some concerns have come up about long-term parking, about storage of vehicles or other types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=3996)|
| 1:06:45| I know there was a vote there and that became a little bit contentious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| but can we put conditions that there's no long-term parking or storage should we decide to deem this over, but also maintaining the public access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4009)|
| 1:07:05| You can retain an easement, but if you close the public right-of-way, the property itself, the fee in the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| reverts to the adjoining property owners to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| We would have to condemn it then if we wanted to do those types of controlling activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| It becomes the property of the owner once you close the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| All we're talking about here is retaining an easement that would allow public access across their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4048)|
| 1:07:36| There can't be conditions attached to the deed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| No, not unless the owners voluntarily offer those to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4061)|
| 1:07:53| That's all I have at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| I'm not sure if I can add anything to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| The moment we discovered the KUB had an easement of the sewer line, the street itself is only 25 foot wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4078)|
| 1:08:06| in the most part where it's already labeled as a no-parking, no-tow-away zone because of the width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| That's what I've learned from signage from Zach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| I'm not sure if that's Zach's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| He's the one that put the work order in about signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| The easement's already 15 foot wide down the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| so it doesn't leave a lot of leeway on either side, if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| That did cross my mind, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| If there is that 15-foot easement with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| then the actual property that would be divided between those two neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| I guess that could eliminate that, but I didn't measure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| Again, I'm just trying to find solutions like my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| Also, I don't feel like it makes sense to be a street that's nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4134)|
| 1:09:04| Thank you, Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| I appreciate all the questions that have been asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| because they have answered some of my questions tonight already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| I appreciate the packet that the clerks have put together to help remind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| of the details of this case before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| I also spent a lot of time out with Richard Clark learning about this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| and also want to find a resolution, as my colleagues do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| because I do find it an unfortunate situation that I think is going to come before us more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4186)|
| 1:09:54| I've seen multiple of my friends who put in fences in their backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| what they thought was their backyard, but they're actually on a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| I'm not going to be the one to tell them that they're in a code violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| but they're going to soon find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| A lot of our community members may not be aware of the changes to our zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| that could impact them like this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| It's pretty common that we're able to put up a privacy fence in our backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| So I really sympathize with the clerks on that side of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| I also sympathize with the one speaker in opposition who came forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4235)|
| 1:10:43| because we want to make sure that we make a decision tonight that will not be carried out in bad faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4243)|
| 1:10:53| that the neighborhood still maintains access to this park through this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| One question that came up just in this most recent exchange is I'm trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4258)|
| 1:11:06| if we approve an easement, but then there are improvements made by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4266)|
| 1:11:14| The city is responsible for maintaining those improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| but has no other authority over that easement that's been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| I think Mr. Frost has some answers to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| To clarify, and Mr. Cannon can certainly correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| there's been a discussion of easements in the KUB easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| That's an easement that is granted to KUB to provide and run utilities, whatever it is, through that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| That's not the same thing as an easement that allows Rob Frost to walk down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| It's simply underground for KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| Also, there's a discussion about location of fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| Again, Director Cannon, a lot of the times the location of fences is a traffic engineering issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| Like on a corner, a fence can't be too tall because it could impede the line of sight for traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4326)|
| 1:12:15| I would respectfully think that fencing issues are more of a code issue rather than a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4335)|
| 1:12:28| Does that answer your question, Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| Well, I was just asking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| If we approve this tonight, just confirming, I think this was just stated by Councilwoman Tester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| that we would only, we authorize to continue to make improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| that we would not have any property ownership interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| What's on the agenda is the appeal by the Clark family, and they're seeking to close that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4369)|
| 1:12:57| So that's what, if you approve their appeal, it closes the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4377)|
| 1:13:04| and then the city legally, Mr. Swanson, correct me please, washes its hands of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| It would have to go back through the process, as Mr. Swanson talked about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| The city would have to come in and claim somehow, maybe through condemnation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4393)|
| 1:13:20| a pedestrian easement to go from the street across the now-closed street to the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4400)|
| 1:13:29| or to that access point in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| And so what was the discussion about whether we make public improvements to the access point or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4412)|
| 1:13:41| I think that discussion had to do with if we have an easement there, if the city has an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| and we create improvements on that easement, like a sidewalk or an entrance or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| we would expect to maintain the improvements that we created within our easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| But what we're talking about here is not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| What we're talking about here is closing the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| and conveying the underlying property to the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| Is that an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Let's say you have to go through the full closure of the street, condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| Would the next step be to put an easement, a public easement, for access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4454)|
| 1:14:21| That would be a policy decision that the city would have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| whether they wanted to go back and create an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| There is a possibility of the conveyance of an easement here as a part of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| but I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| That's not what's before us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Council Member Rodger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| Yeah, I mean, some of my questions may have been covered and answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| but Ms. Parker, or Council Member Parker, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| You said something about code changes in the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| We didn't make any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| You mean like recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| That was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| If someone can clarify, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| Yeah, that was not a change in recode, those fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| And again, Mr. Frost and Mr. Cannon, fences are in several sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| but that was not an addition as part of recode, unless Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| my understanding is that was not an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| No, not related to fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| You're correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| So it's always been a part of our code that if you live on a corner of a street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| your backyard is considered a front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| It's actually not considered a backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| It's considered a corner side yard, is the actual term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Well, this is an update for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| I'm seeing lots of violations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| Lots of folks did put those fences in in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| Ms. Ryder, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| So, Mr. Cannon, so I'm sorry to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| but from an engineering perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| and I think this is what Mr. Frost touched on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| when a house is on a corner, a normal corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| the side yard is considered an additional front yard because of sight distancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4564)|
| 1:16:12| Sight distance becomes a factor in any improvements that are done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| but the way that the zoning ordinance is set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| and Ms. Brooks, I'm going to lean on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| it technically is a double front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| It has the potential for being declared that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Okay, and it's treated that way with siting of the house as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| If you had a raw piece of land and you were setting up the house as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Sorry, I guess we're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| So, if we approve this tonight, it doesn't have an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| and the city has to go back and do an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| and we have to follow the laws where we have to offer payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| appraisal and payment for it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| Is there no easement worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Well, I'm not aware of there being a public access easement included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| with this potential measure right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| What this is is simply a closing of the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| conveying of the property from the middle of it to each side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| and does not include a public access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| Now, I think the idea too of placing bollards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| and leaving the right-of-way open I do not believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| solves the zoning issue either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| I'm concerned with what the consequences are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| for passing the appeal in terms of the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| because that's not ironed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| We've also had other issues before where we've had to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| based on something that became a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| or something that was placed without a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| and so that's what we're trying to do is retroactively solve that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| I know we're not trying to come up with the entire solution tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| but am I understanding this correctly that if we approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| and allow the property owners to have the entire street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| as part of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| the applicant and their neighbors could deed a public access smaller amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| to the city for $0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| but still maintain public access to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| would not impede any current easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| or impede KUB's access in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| but also allow for solving a lot of the ancillary problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| that Mr. Applicant has mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| That could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| That's not a part of what's before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| Okay, so it is possible for us to close this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| and the property owners to deed back a portion of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| so that the neighborhood and everybody in the city can still access the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| That cannot be solved tonight, but that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| Can I add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| I know I just repeated myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| but it's worth repeating an affirmative as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| So what you have suggested is a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| but if you move forward with the appeal tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| it's not a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| One could postpone it and then gather together and find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Thank you, Mr. Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Mr. Swanson, I want to be clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| because I think everybody's trying to find a solution tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| What we have before us is an appeal of another decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| and we have to decide whether we're going to uphold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| or deny the Planning Commission's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| If we want to look for an alternative answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| with all these fabulous things that are talked about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| our only option would be to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| and have another solution come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| I think I'm kind of speechifying and kind of asking a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| but I'm trying to see what our options are here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| because what I hear is everybody's sympathetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| I understand the sightline issue, but it's a dead end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| and there's no sightline, there's no traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| So I don't understand why variance for the fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| even if it was a mistake, is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| I think that got us to closing a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| because that would then fix that it's a side yard, front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| and I just think this has gotten a whole lot harder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| than it has to be in my naive assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| So I'm asking, how do we get out of this, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| Do I make a motion to postpone and let people smarter than me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| figure this out and come back with a solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| Postponement is a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| and you could explore the possibility of a voluntary conveyance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| at no cost to the city of a public access easement across this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| That could be explored during a period of postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| You could simply not grant the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| and then they'd have to start all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| I don't really think that's fair to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| so I wouldn't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| I'm just trying to look for a way to solve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| So I think you had your light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| so I was going to ask for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Postpone until when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| Four weeks, because if they're ready before then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| we can come back until September 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| A motion to postpone until September 7th, made by Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| Okay, we're voting on the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| Mayor, before we end the debate, can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| Wait, I think Vice Mayor McKenzie, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Council Member Roberto, and then Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| The issues that we're discussing this evening are the same ones that I've struggled with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| because I also agree that there is really no benefit to the city or the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| If we didn't have neighbors who were asking for the road to remain open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4976)|
| 1:23:02| then I think it would be a simpler issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| The issue with the corner side yard is that the build line for the pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| has to be even with where the house is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| So it's not the entire backyard is the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| It's just the part that is not covered by the sight line of the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| So that's where we got to the point about if we move the pool 8 to 12 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| something to that effect, then it would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| But I would agree with the idea about having a postponement for weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| The issues that we heard from the neighbors were they don't want to see parking on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| and they want to make sure there's pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| So I think if a solution can be found where there's no parking on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| which is what the exchange between Director Ely and I was about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| if you put up the ball yards, it shortens the length of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| and then you still have the pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| But I do think this one could use some more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| If we had more folks here, we could have a better discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| So I would agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| So I know it's already been seconded, but I'd second it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| I just think that we are going to make bad policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| Mr. Roberto, Council Member Husserman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| I may have answered my own question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| So we postpone work to come up with a more viable solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| Does it go back to planning, or it just comes back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| Depending on whether we can show on the record that planning has considered the subject that changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5081)|
| 1:24:49| then possibly it would not have to go back to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| But if we came up with something totally new and totally creative in this whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| that planning had never considered, it would have to go back to planning first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| So it depends on what happens from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| Also, keep in mind there's still a zoning issue out there that is not resolved by all of this question about access easements and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5106)|
| 1:25:17| There's still the fence issue out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| Ms. Tusserman, any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| No, I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| What I'll say is if I recall on the fence, when the clerks did go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5123)|
| 1:25:30| it was the recommendation, I believe, to move forward with this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| We started this process with zoning and a BZA application last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| It was actually the 1st of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| Looking at everything that was involved, Stephen, I believe Stephen was his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| decided we do not need to move forward with the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| It would be better to do a right-of-way closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Let's take the packet across the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| And that's where it led to dealing with planning because of the front yard issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| and the pool that was placed there and the different aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| It was better to just go for the right-of-way closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| It would solve all the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| That's where we ended up with planning and putting that packet together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| I hope that helped. Maybe that clarifies that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| Vice Mayor McKenzie and then Council Member Bynum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| Just a couple of points of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| With the postponement to go back and look at some additional solutioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| would the Planning Commission be engaged in those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| or whose responsibility would it be to have those reviewed by them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| or considered by them prior to this coming back on Council agenda in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| Director Brooks, you look like you had an answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| I'll defer to my city colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| but I don't see that it would be appropriate for Planning Commission to weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| on easements and things that the city would have the responsibility for taking over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| I think we would need to sit down with the individuals who have an interest in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| What I'm hearing is we need park access that is safe for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| and we need to work through these issues on the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| We'll try to sit down and come up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| No guarantees, but we'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| That will be Director Cannon, it will be Mr. Ahrens, it will be Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| We'll work with our team, obviously law, and try to come up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| Okay, Council Member Ryder, and then Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| Curiosity killed the cat, but I was curious what Mr. Brown had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| I was just going to point out that September 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| Come speak to the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5269)|
| 1:27:56| I just wanted to point out that September 7th is the first day of Rosh Hashanah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| and it would be nice if we could have the reconvening of this at some other date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5280)|
| 1:28:10| I have more to say, but I'll save that for another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| I just wanted to request that when we are looking into the various solutions to this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5298)|
| 1:28:29| I think it warrants looking at our zoning code to see if we can make a small change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5309)|
| 1:28:37| where if someone lives on the corner street, but there's no site issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5317)|
| 1:28:46| then we're not back in a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| Ms. Parker, I think you might have accidentally turned your mic off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Yes, now I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| I think Ms. Brooks heard my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5340)|
| 1:29:08| Do you want me to repeat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Council Member Parker, I think planning absolutely agrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| and I think that there is a need to look at the corner yard setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| and how those are defined and where the exceptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| there should be some exceptions to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| So absolutely, it's on our radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| Council Member Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| What I would suggest, based on what Mr. Brown had just informed us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| is that we do a postponement to September 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| and that would also give us more time to have the meetings that Deputy Mayor Brace was discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| So I'd make a motion to postpone to September 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| An amendment or a friendly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| Are you amending my motion, or do you want me to just change my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| Whatever procedurally works, I think we should move to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| Because I was going to do the same thing with my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| Would you accept a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| Yes, I will accept a friendly amendment because I turned my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| So now the motion on the floor is a motion to postpone until September 24th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| That's correct, Mayor, September 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Everyone check that this doesn't interfere with other holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| Rosh Hashanah is followed closely by Yom Kippur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| That's the motion on the floor, and it was a friendly motion, so I guess. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| Yes, Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| Yes, I just had, simply for clarification, a question from Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5433)|
| 1:30:39| The proposal that you suggested a little bit earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| is that to put bollards on the street near Bennington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| but the property would remain city property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| So the discussion that I had with Director Ely was to shorten the length of Glenmore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5457)|
| 1:31:05| by bringing bollards in to prevent parking as far back as it can now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| And that would shorten the street and would address the parking issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| but also allow the pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| But I think, given the discussion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| it would probably be a good idea still to vet that through all the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| before implementing something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| So I think there are other options, and I'm glad they came out this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| Yes, just thanks for your clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| I just wanted to make sure that I understood, and I'm for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| But your suggestion would still be on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| Mr. Roberto, just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| I think you meant Tuesday, September 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| You were looking at August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Yes, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| Okay, so the motion on the floor is to postpone this item until Tuesday, September 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5520)|

| 1:34:28| has caused an increase in the cost here to take care of that deterioration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5668)|

| 1:35:59| of items on this agenda that represent another significant investment in our ongoing work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| to provide funding to partners who are providing critical social services throughout our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5765)|

| 1:36:23| has supported during COVID to support these types of social services, this funding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5788)|

| 1:37:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| I have a lot of questions about the Knox Housing Assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| Your microphone's off again, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| It's these arms on the chairs keep bumping into things, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| Try now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| Is it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| Yeah, I think we heard you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| Is this better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Yeah, it's a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| Bad microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| I've gotten a lot of questions about Knox Housing Assistance and how much funding is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5863)|
| 1:37:51| Is there a way for us to have a public accounting of those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| And I know there's a new website that's been started, but it doesn't tell me how much funds are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| And part of the reason I want to know is so that when community members come to me and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5883)|
| 1:38:11| you know, I've been told there are no funds available, I can go to this resource and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| no, there are funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Let's figure out why you're hitting a wall with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| I'm hearing different policies, like if you've received assistance in the last 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| you can't come back for assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| So I'm just trying to get an understanding of where community members can seek out that assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| who's eligible, and whether we have sufficient funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Funding is being administered through Knox County, but we are working closely with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| And I didn't know if Ms. Wade wanted to speak at all to how that partnership with the county is working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| and potentially direct Councilwoman Parker to the correct resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Becky Wade, Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| Ms. Parker, I'll be happy to get you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| I don't have that with me right now as far as how many funds are left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| I know the county is dispersing funds regularly now to landlords and to tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5952)|
| 1:39:20| so I'll be happy to get you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| And if there are specific questions you might have about individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| you can send that to me or to Jenny Holden at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| She's the Director of County Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| Thank you, Ms. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=5977)|

| 1:43:19| a strategic planning process, and we are excited for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| as Mayor Kincannon sits on our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| and we're excited about the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| to get through that process really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| before we make any significant changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| to how we're operating with community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| Today's the second day, first full day of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| so it is very exciting and hectic pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| to make sure that students have everything they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| so that they can focus and learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| and be attentive to their educational outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| I don't really have any specific updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| but I'm happy to entertain any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| I'll just ask one question for, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| public folks to know is how many middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| and how many elementary schools are you guys in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Because you're just elementary and middle, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| We're currently in elementary and middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| In the city limits of Knoxville, we're in 15 total schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| three middle schools and 12 elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| They're on the back of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| I just want to say I wholeheartedly support this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| The idea of community schools really came up 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| 21 years ago in Nine Counties, One Vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| talking about schools as community assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| and how it really helped improve education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| and the lives of the children and the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| that are part of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| I'm happy to see that this program has taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| It is very valued by all the administrators in the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| They do tremendous work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| and I think it's something that we have begun to just assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| will always be around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| It is not unless organizations like the city help support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| the great work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| So I am a strong advocate for this and would, as the Mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| also encourage all my colleagues to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| Yes, I appreciate everything Council Person Fugate just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| and I will simply say that even though public education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| is under the purview basically of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| this is a very significant way that we can contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| to public education in a supplementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| more than a supplementary way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| This is very important and it serves a tremendous purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| and I'm proud to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6357)|

| 1:47:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| Mr. Givens has signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| Please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| State your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| My name is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| I reside at 1823 Explorer Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| The existing co-responder model is a bad model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| It doesn't get rid of the issues with deploying police to mental health crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| and it doesn't reduce costs either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| No one should be happy with this solution, not fiscal conservatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| and not those that claim to care about the mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| The council is by now well aware of the CAHOOTS program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| thanks to dedicated activists in the mental health care community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| CAHOOTS saves $8 million a year for Eugene, Oregon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| Knoxville's program adds to an already burgeoning police budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| Eugene, Oregon has about 176,000 residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| and Knoxville has about 188,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| A similar program here could generate similar savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| And I'm certain it would be more revenue positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| than a $100 million loan for a baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| KPD officers receive a remarkable level of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| but very little of that training is devoted to protecting the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| and very much to protecting the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| KPD officers receive 112 hours of physical defensive tactics training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| but they only get 24 hours of de-escalation training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| KPD officers are also trained to identify pre-attack indicators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| Pre-attack indicators are a pseudoscientific rubric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| for justifying the use of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| Here are some real pre-attack indicators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| that our officers are trained to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| Blinking too fast or too slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| Looking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6549)|

| 1:49:28| Looking at an officer's taser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| As you can see, there are a lot of dangerous places to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6570)|

| 1:49:35| Do you think a person having a stroke or a diabetic attack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| or some other mental health crisis can pass that test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| If you have some dust in your eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| when a police officer asks you a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| the court could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| the suspect showed the following pre-attack indicators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| Rapid blinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Tension in the jaw and shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Hesitation in response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| I deployed my taser to prevent the suspect's imminent attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| Once on the ground, the suspect continued to resist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| The co-responder model sends these trained officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| as the primary leads on scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| Mental health experts should lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| Officers should be backup only to be summoned if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| Given the poor vetting of contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| and recent project overruns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| I will discuss later in the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| I believe as much information as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| should be available to the city councillors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| before they are asked to vote on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| The agenda packet for this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| includes only the winning RFP bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| with no information on the other bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| or their relative costs and merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6634)|

| 1:50:42| and most resolutions that come before this assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| is rushed and haphazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| with too little information and too little time to review it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| given to city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| I worked on multi-million dollar federal projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| for over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| With less than three bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| federal projects require open book pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| and independent cost verification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| There's no information like that here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| and I understand that the city has fewer resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| than the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| but that's no reason to simply contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| to your existing partners without a thorough accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| I challenge the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| to answer the following questions for our council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| What has been the impact of our program to date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| 199 calls were responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| What was the outcome of those calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| How many arrests have been diverted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| How many people have been placed in treatment or housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| Without evidence of success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| we have only this program's incredibly glaring failure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| the death of Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| I will reserve the remainder of my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| as a moment of silence for Ant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Thank you, Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| That concludes public forum on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| Council, I appreciate your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| for expanding this important program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| as part of this year's approved budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| Following a competitive procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| the McNabb Center was selected to continue in their role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| as our co-response partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| and we look forward to working with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| to scale up the program in the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| I believe Ms. Human Hilliard and Ms. Allen from McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| are both in attendance tonight to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| I've raised many concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| and so I will not use up a lot of time tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| but it just struck me that we began tonight's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| acknowledging that we needed a different...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6753)|
| 1:52:40| ..we needed a different approach to public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| in response to a surge in violent crime in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6764)|
| 1:52:52| And we were informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| of what traditional policing activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| KPD would potentially scale back on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| to respond to violent crimes in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6783)|
| 1:53:10| And yet later in our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| we are discussing expanding a program within KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| that does not have anything to do with violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| And, in fact, the community has called on the city's response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6802)|
| 1:53:29| to the needs represented in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| to be a response that does not involve the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| And when we had our presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| we had the workshop on this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| there was a discussion of how do we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| ..how do we intervene at different points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| to keep folks, especially folks with mental health challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6832)|
| 1:53:59| from entering the criminal justice system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| And, again, I have to emphasize that the way that we keep them...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6841)|
| 1:54:08| ..the way that we prevent ourselves as policymakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| from using the criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| to deal with issues that should not be dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| by the criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| is to give them services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| that do not involve the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| So I'm still a supporter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| and believe we have all of the capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| the willingness in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| in parts of our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| to move forward with a program that does not involve police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| and then KPD can focus their energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| on those issues that they are best trained for in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| that we do not have anybody else in the city trained for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| But in terms of mental health professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| we have mental health professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| we have emergency personnel that we can lean on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| that we can pull into a table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| to discuss how can we provide this new needed service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| so KPD can focus on helping us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| ensure that we don't lose another young person to gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| That's where I want KPD's attention focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| We have other folks we can lean on for this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| who are better capable of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| I would just love to hear from the McNabb representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| on how this program is going and just some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| I'm Leanne Heumann-Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| I'm the Clinical Vice President of the Helen Ross McNabb Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| and Candace Allen is our Senior Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| over our criminal justice programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| I think the program is very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| To date, we have provided and responded to over 262 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| We are still seeing consistent patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| in the number of individuals who can be diverted from jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| with over 50% of those going into different programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| such as our homeless programming, medical detoxification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| residential rehab, programming like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| There's a significantly large number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| 50% are going into a higher level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| well, an assessment for a higher level of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| typically seen through our emergency departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Just to be clear on that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| if we have an individual that our social worker believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| needs to be, and the officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| needs to be evaluated for an inpatient hospital stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| that process really takes place at the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| That doesn't mean that at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| an additional triage happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| They may go into the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| or they may get additional services referred to at that time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| So at this point, I feel like we have been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| It started very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| We have had positive responses from individuals that we have served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7027)|
| 1:57:13| and I've been very proud of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| Candace, do you want to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| Well, I think just to the point of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| Can you all hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| You know, I do believe that what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| is diverting individuals that traditionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| may have been guided towards the criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| and into jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| and we are seeing a diversion from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| because one of the things that we very much believe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| is decriminalizing, you know, mental illness and addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| and I think that this program has exemplified that philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| and that dedication, and the data supports that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| Yeah, I would just like to add that I don't think that we would believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| that it is ever a wonderful outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| for anybody suffering with a mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| or a substance abuse disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| to be provided services through law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| and there are community services out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| including us and many others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| who hopefully can respond upstream to that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| so that they're never in front of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| Unfortunately, right now, that's not the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| for a lot of our citizens in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| but we believe that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| placing a social worker in those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| creates a better outcome for that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| That doesn't mean that there aren't additional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| that can be wrapped around to include that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| alternative response models and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| so I think this is a service that meets a specific gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7124)|
| 1:58:50| Thank you so much. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| You're on a state task force that's researching these models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| I thought we had that conversation a long time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| Can you repeat that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| I thought that Ms. Allen was on a state task force with NAMI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| and looking at alternative models for policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| Are you on our state task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| No. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| Must have been speaking to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| Candace, are you on a state task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| I'm on the CIT state task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| And, of course, NAMI supports CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| They're big, you know, proponents of CIT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| and so I'm on that, but not looking at alternative models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| And is that working with, are they connected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7175)|
| 1:59:41| The CIT task force with looking at what is going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| with the co-responder model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| I have been asked to speak about the co-response models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| with various police departments and behavioral health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| at the request of NAMI and CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| I actually have a question for the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| Are we looking at other models to implement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| I know I've spoken with Brad Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| with 9-1-1, and it's a very complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| there are a lot of different pieces to put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| Are we working on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| So right now we're working with this model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| and I'll leave that to the experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| as we move through this system and we add these teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| They may see something that needs to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| and we will definitely rely on their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| So the police department looking, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7236)|
| 2:00:37| But we rely on the experts that are working with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| to see how we can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| Back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7242)|
| 2:00:43| Council Member Singh, Ms. Gill has a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| a lot more information to share on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Yes, and this may be the segue back over to McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| At our workshop a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| we discussed the importance of the SIMS exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| in identifying some of the gaps in the system from 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| and our desire with McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| and working with the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| to identify opportunities to pursue a new updated SIMS model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| That would reflect 2021 and the new resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| that are now available in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| That SIMS model, if you recall, and for those listening tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| that is the systemic intercept model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| And so that is a very comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| and multi-institutional approach to understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| where people interact with the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| And if you recall, we used the term intercept zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| which actually tries to get ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| of any of that potential interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| with the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| And it's under that intercept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| that some of these new models are emerging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| So we have followed up on that request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| and hope that we would be able to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| And I hope we'll be able to actually come back to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| hopefully before the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| with the contract and or agreement somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| with McNabb or another provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| to be able to do that SIMS mapping process again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| as we discussed with that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| Does that have anything in common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| with the CAHOOTS type of alternative model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| Yeah, so if you recall from our workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| that SIMS process is the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| through which our community as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| and I'm going to turn it back over to McNabb, ladies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| because I think you can describe this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| but that is the way in which we identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| where resources are locally as well as where gaps are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| so that we can really be informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| about where the opportunities may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| for what we call the alternative response model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| that is distinct from a co-response model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| So I would just add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| I think what we would want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| is to really evaluate the gap between when an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| right before law enforcement, is called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| and what services are missing or not accessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| between then and when the call is made to law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| that we could potentially look at implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| And so that's part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| I think that's where we can move a little upstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| before that call is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| I just think we need lots and lots of tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| I like this tool, but we need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| So I'm hoping that we continue to work towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| Just a specific question about this additional resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| So currently we have one team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| and they work how many hours a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| and how many days a week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| Do you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| They work Monday through Thursday for 10 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| And with the addition of these new teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| will that get us closer to 24-7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| It does not get you to 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| but it gets you to covering it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| until I think about 1 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| I don't have those statistics in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| So does it get us seven days a week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| So with the addition of these resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| we go from four days a week, 10 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| so roughly 40 hours a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| to seven days a week to almost 1 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| And the shift typically begins what time, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| 7 a.m. to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| So, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| I think this is well worth the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| Yes, I have a question for the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| I appreciate the work that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| Council Member Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| just speak really closely into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| I want to make sure it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| I'll unmask briefly if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| There's some concern, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| and I think it's a valid concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| that some people would react in a negative way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| if they're first confronted with a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| and not a mental health worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| Is this a set protocol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| like when you encounter someone on a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| that it's the police officer that makes the first contact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| or is there some kind of flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| Do you assess the situation on site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| I'll start with that, and Candice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| you fill in if you think you would like to add anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| I think the team, if the team were here right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| they would tell you that every call is unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| every person is unique, every situation is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| And so they're going to show up and assess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| I would assume visually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| to see what would be the best response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| If it feels and looks like a safe situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| then the social worker is going to engage initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| We want to make sure that the situation is safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| for everyone first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| but what I've heard from the officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| and from our social worker is that training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| and that partnership has gone really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| and they've been able to assess that pretty effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| They've not had any negative outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| I think it's been very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| So they're, you know, I'm not an officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| so I don't know how they see a scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| and are able to evaluate for safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| but I think the example we gave in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| if there's a situation where someone's in the middle of a street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| we're going to have to have law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| kind of step in at that point and make everything safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| But for the individual, if it's safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| we want the social worker to respond first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| Okay, that's very helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| and I take it that your approach is constantly being re-evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| as you get more experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| and you see how various people are reacting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| Sure, and I will say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| when you're hiring a social worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| and our social workers are master's level clinicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| there is a training that is involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| just understanding engaging individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| and that is a skill they learn through their education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| and through their practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| So I think they're highly trained in understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| how to approach individuals in that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| in a way that can be de-escalating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| and just for a better outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| Right, and I understand it's a balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| Security and being sensitive to the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| of the people that you're confronting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| But I'm glad to hear that you're moving in the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| of possibly putting the officers more in the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| than only is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| And I would reiterate my concern of Councilperson Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| is that I think this is a great tool in the toolbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| but we don't want to necessarily limit this toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7661)|
| 2:07:47| But you folks are on the front line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| and we're going to leave it to you to make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| and suggestions about how this is working or not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| or how we may want to supplement it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| or expand in the program or a different program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| So your work is very, very valuable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| and we're going to be relying a lot on your experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| out in the field about knowing how to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| with expansion or additional tools in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7700)|
| 2:08:21| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| I just want to remind the public who may be attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| for watching this discussion for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| we held a workshop back in June, June 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| so I encourage anybody that wants to know more about this model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| to watch that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| It was lengthy, in-depth, and we considered a number of models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| There was a lot of research in different cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| that pointed to extending this model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| and there was data from the pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| including a couple of stats that always stuck with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| was that a third of these calls were related to suicidal ideation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| and a half of them resulted in a trip to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| So important stats, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| and there's important research that's gone into this pilot extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7739)|
| 2:09:03| Obviously, we can always improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| We should seek to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| This is the floor, not the ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| But that June 24th workshop is extremely informative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| for those who want to learn more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7753)|
| 2:09:14| Council Member Smith, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| I just had to bring up this point again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| and I can't remember when I brought this before council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| but I've done a lot of research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| about how we could bring an alternative model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| or create an alternative model in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| And just one important point that I want my colleagues to hear is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| we do not have mental health professionals in the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| So when we take folks, okay, not enough staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| And what I've heard from ER doctors is that they are overwhelmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| when we treat emergency rooms as mental health hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| But what I've heard from CAHOOTS style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| is they are actually able to deal with that crisis in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| and calm folks down, give them treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| but handle that mental health crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| so that we don't have to take folks to the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| That's another reason why the alternative model is so important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| for so many reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| In addition to the care that individuals are receiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| I mean, the bottom line is it's going to save us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| So I just don't want us to think about folks going to the ER as a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| because they're not going to get the care that they need at the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| We're overwhelming ERs when we send folks in mental crisis to an ER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7838)|

| 2:12:42| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7964)|

| 2:12:50| in their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7970)|

| 2:12:54| Yes, thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| I'll add that representatives from Aramark are present as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| as our university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| The Aramark, as is outlined in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| and as Mr. McDonald might explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| they will take all the volunteers to go through their own program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=7993)|
| 2:13:22| before our games to be trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| The university has two facilities at the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| Thompson Bowling Arena and Nalens Stadium have a very large number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8011)|
| 2:13:37| points where fans can buy concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| I grossly underestimated and found out tonight that in Nalens Stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| there are 70 places where you can buy refreshments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8026)|
| 2:13:51| Allison Dyer in the law department, I and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| and Council Member Roberto and the university and Aramark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| looked at the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| We tried to develop an ordinance that would accommodate the needs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8042)|
| 2:14:08| Aramark and the university while trying to provide a level of comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| and safety that the members of city council could accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| What we have in front of you all tonight as a proposal is the creature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8058)|
| 2:14:24| of several weeks of discussions, drafting, redrafting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| and we think this is something that can work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8070)|
| 2:14:36| but it's only as good as the people who implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| Aramark, as I'm sure they'll say, they want to not allow underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8080)|
| 2:14:49| They are looking at electronic equipment for checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8089)|
| 2:14:57| I've personally experienced the cellular connectivity problems in both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| the football stadium and basketball arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| Mr. McDonald, they're trying to find something that can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| to check IDs, but Aramark has a program in place which they intend to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8109)|
| 2:15:16| If a NPO violates, they can be struck off the list where they're no longer able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8116)|
| 2:15:27| to participate in concessions, and they have a process for looking at people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8127)|
| 2:15:35| and bringing people on board in order to learn the process to sell responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8135)|
| 2:15:44| I'd love to hear from the representatives at Aramark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8144)|
| 2:15:51| If you could please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| Yes, my name is Michael McDonald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| I live at 1713 Bayer Run Drive in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8157)|
| 2:16:01| and I am the district manager for Aramark with responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| for the University of Tennessee sport venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8164)|
| 2:16:08| Why is there a need for volunteers instead of paid staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| We tried to engage paid staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| We've run multiple job fairs over the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| Initially, when we first started selling beer there, we were able to get around 200 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8179)|
| 2:16:25| Subsequently, we're left today with about 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| despite two and a half years of endeavoring to find these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| The challenges are it's a very sporadic work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| It's seven days, six, seven days at the stadium, another ten or so at the arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8197)|
| 2:16:43| dependent on the number of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| So when you couple the challenges of parking, logistics, with one day's worth of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8206)|
| 2:16:52| it really becomes problematic for getting the numbers we need to distribute across the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8212)|
| 2:16:59| And we believe more distribution actually makes it safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| because you get more people engaged in the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| It pulls some of the lines away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| And the NPOs, quite frankly, are a very good source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| We use them around the country, facilities such as Neyland and Boulding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8232)|
| 2:17:18| It's an individual that's really engaged with a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| They're generally there for a higher purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| They're there raising it for their kids or their organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| They don't want to besmirch the organization or have themselves either get kicked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8248)|
| 2:17:33| or the group lose out on the fundraising piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| So around the country, it's been a very viable option for acquiring the volunteers needed to serve the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8256)|
| 2:17:45| We put them through the same training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| All right, they go through team training, which is a nationally recognized program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| We work with Sergeant Coward here, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| He's come and done red box training and addressed the groups in our orientations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| We've worked with Top Shelf, the local organization that helps us come with improvements to our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8280)|
| 2:18:09| And then recently, the scanners we've agreed to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8289)|
| 2:18:13| The connectivity issues are the problem at the two facilities because they get sporadic connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8293)|
| 2:18:20| which leads to incorrect either wait times or wrong information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8300)|
| 2:18:28| We're searching for something that would be able to be done offline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| The providers we've looked at so far really are reluctant to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| because of the types of privacy information that may be in a device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| So we're still looking for that solution where we'd be able to scan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8320)|
| 2:18:45| as opposed to right now we use the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| Okay, there's an ID checking guide and the red box scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| A couple different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| So when I have worked or volunteered with organizations that utilize a lot of volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8333)|
| 2:19:00| there needs to be somebody who is, that that's their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| Because otherwise, volunteers, it's really hard to get commitments and follow through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| and they kind of come in one time and then don't the next few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8348)|
| 2:19:13| Do you have somebody who's going to be in charge of volunteers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| How is that structured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| We have our management staff, which includes three managers, as well as I have a regional HR person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| We've got 50 to 60 groups we've worked with for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| And everyone has to have a certification date and a certification number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| and their expiration date on record before they're allowed to serve the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| Other question would be, how much do you pay for servers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8378)|
| 2:19:43| It really, to the volunteers it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| No, the paid staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| The paid staff, we were originally in the $10 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| We've gone up to as high as $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| So you pay $15 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| If we could find the bartenders, we would pay them, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| So you do pay $15 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8400)|
| 2:20:01| Right now we're currently paying $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| So this is something I'm very uncomfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| I take alcohol consumption very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| When it's at the university, I take it even more seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8410)|
| 2:20:14| I have expressed my disappointment in the Aramark Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8414)|
| 2:20:20| There are a lot of things that I have issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| I just don't think there's always been ethical practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| So I'm going to be voting no for several reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| but mainly I'm not sure if the volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8428)|
| 2:20:32| if that is going to be the safest way to serve beer at a university setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8432)|
| 2:20:41| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| Vice Mayor McKenzie and then Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| Just a couple of points of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| So I want to clarify that this is stating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8451)|
| 2:20:57| if we pass this, it authorizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| permittees to employ persons 18 years of age or older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| to sell or dispense beer in the course of their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| I just need a confirmation that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| they would be able to employ 18-year-olds to sell or dispense beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| Wait staff at a restaurant, Vice Mayor, can serve alcohol right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| So this would be along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| Mr. Swanson, do you agree with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| I say our chief, 18 years old, can serve beer, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8492)|
| 2:21:40| Can sell or dispense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8500)|
| 2:21:45| Council Member Roberto, to serve beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| To serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| I think it's 21 to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| To serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8513)|
| 2:21:54| Well, certainly there's some debate going on about whether or not they can or can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| Mr. Frost, can folks who are 18 serve and dispense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| Serve, not dispense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| Do you know the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| Sell or dispense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| I think they can serve and dispense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| Let's move on to Chapter 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8529)|
| 2:22:19| Vice Mayor McKenzie, did you have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| We can come back to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| Also, I think Councilwoman Singh asked the level of supervision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| And so at any given time, let's say at a major event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| because you've indicated that this is necessary because of the inability to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| able to hire enough staff to man events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| So let's say at a very popular event and you have multiple stations open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8559)|
| 2:22:45| what is the level of supervision for potentially a person 18 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| maybe a couple 18-year-olds, serving and dispensing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| What is the level of supervision at each of those stations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| The plan that we presented to the beer board included 36 supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| Each supervisor having like no more than three locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| And I will tell you that the number of 18-year-olds is extremely low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8587)|
| 2:23:12| I mean, it's generally parents that are here volunteering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8592)|
| 2:23:18| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| However, if we pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| it gives the flexibility in the event there's an influx of 18- to 19-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| could be allowed to be volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| And so if there's a supervisor and they are responsible for three stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| that means they're kind of floating around supervising potentially 18-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8614)|
| 2:23:39| Then also there was a question asked and it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| in the event that someone serves or dispenses to someone under age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| the NPO would be taken off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| But I'd like to ask what would be the liability or responsibility of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| organization that has the beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8635)|
| 2:24:01| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| Thank you, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| and thank you for the lifelines being thrown to me by Directors Brace and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| And also Section 4-37B of our code says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8650)|
| 2:24:15| a permittee may employ a person's 18 years of age or older to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8655)|
| 2:24:20| or dispense beer in the course of their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| And then she just asked another question, which maybe you didn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| Vice Mayor, could you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| So now we have the question about 18-year-olds dispensing and selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| That's an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8674)|
| 2:24:35| So we've confirmed that it is legal for an 18-year-old to sell or dispense beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8675)|
| 2:24:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| I just looked up Tennessee law while I was waiting on Mr. Frost to look it up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| We confirmed the same answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| It's 18 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| So the question was asked earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| either a statement was made that if someone working with an MPO does sell to underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8695)|
| 2:25:01| that that MPO would be taken off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| And I'm sure that volunteer would probably be taken off the list to be able to come back in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| But is there any liability on the person or the organization that holds the beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8708)|
| 2:25:15| Vice Mayor, in terms of supposing somebody goes out and drunks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| is driving while impaired and hits someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8721)|
| 2:25:26| Is that your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| No, if it is, if they, let's say that there is, they're doing a compliance check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8727)|
| 2:25:33| and someone who's a volunteer serves to an underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8733)|
| 2:25:39| That person can be cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| That volunteer can be cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| But not the organization that holds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| Well, no, it would be, the organization would be getting in trouble as well, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8746)|
| 2:25:52| It would just be similar to, for sake of argument, Ruby Tuesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8752)|
| 2:25:58| So, and, you know, if there are two or more sales, two or more underage sales in a rolling two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8758)|
| 2:26:05| the permit holder, which in this case would be Aramark, would be coming before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8765)|
| 2:26:13| And also, Mr. McDonald, do you wish to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8773)|
| 2:26:18| You know, we have complete responsibility for the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| We're not advocating any responsibility or any liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| I mean, groups, people that do serve underage, we do take out of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| And that would be whether an employee or an NPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| And they're not permitted to serve again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| We also don't engage the NPOs in the service until we kind of have a track record with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8797)|
| 2:26:42| We have a number of them with us, been with us for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8802)|
| 2:26:46| So we want to understand how they react.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| There's more, you know, compliance issues around than just the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| So how do they react to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| How do they fulfill their commitment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| You know, we've given that at least a year of that exposure before we would even consider allowing somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8816)|
| 2:27:02| a group, to serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| And I definitely understand many, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| a volunteer with some service organizations that were doing volunteer work at games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8828)|
| 2:27:13| And it's very chaotic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| There's a lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| So I do feel like there's a lot of opportunity for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8836)|
| 2:27:24| underage people potentially with the volunteer thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| But thank you guys for answering and clarifying my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8847)|
| 2:27:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie, Council Member Testerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| and then I think Council Member Fugate was next, and then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| I just wanted to say when I first heard about this and learned a little bit more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8858)|
| 2:27:44| I understand that, you know, there are liabilities, but there's also consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| But I also think that it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| clearly you've been doing this across the country in other situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8871)|
| 2:27:57| I thought it was a pretty creative solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| I mean, I presume that I don't know if this just came about because of the labor shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8880)|
| 2:28:06| or if this was something that you all instituted prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| But I also think it's a great way for nonprofits to get involved in a way for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8889)|
| 2:28:17| them to earn some much-needed dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| So in my opinion, I thought it was a pretty creative solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| We actually have done it for a number of years around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| We've had great success with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| And timing is everything, but the young woman who spoke to you first here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| she was at our NPO meeting last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| Yeah, I just think it's a great way for you all to be embedded in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| and to create opportunities to give back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8919)|
| 2:28:42| So I just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| Thank you, Councilmember Testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| Councilmember Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8926)|
| 2:28:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| I think you sort of answered one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| How many facilities do you do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| We have hundreds, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| Major League Baseball, hockey, basketball, baseball, NCAAs, all major leagues, MCAA sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8940)|
| 2:29:09| So you have a track record of doing this with people this age and it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8949)|
| 2:29:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8955)|
| 2:29:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8956)|
| 2:29:17| I mean, I think I experienced that at the Titans Stadium when I went to see a soccer, the men's soccer team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8957)|
| 2:29:24| There was a band booster club working one of the concession stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| That's what you're talking about, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| It puts a lot of money back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| Yes, they said they really appreciate the opportunity because they were making lots of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| Thank you, Councilmember Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8981)|
| 2:29:42| Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| So this has a very limited application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| Its venue is above 17,500 capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| In those types of venues, what we were hearing was that there were significant challenges to having folks be able to come into work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=8995)|
| 2:30:04| When you're talking about 70 places in a particular venue, that's maybe not the easiest thing to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9004)|
| 2:30:11| There was also discussion about being able to use this as an opportunity for different organizations to be able to raise money for the good work that they do in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9011)|
| 2:30:22| So it does seem like a creative way to deal with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9022)|
| 2:30:26| It does require a written plan for what the volunteers will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9026)|
| 2:30:31| It also requires proof of insurance, which I think is part of what Vice Mayor McKenzie was getting at earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9031)|
| 2:30:37| So there is a requirement for insurance, so there's proper insurance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9037)|
| 2:30:42| We did discuss the training that volunteers have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| And something that's unique to this particular version is that Mr. Frost can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9046)|
| 2:30:52| but I believe this is the first time we've ever required the provision of electronic devices to validate age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9052)|
| 2:31:00| Yes, because of these circumstances, the electronic devices are being required as well as providing proof of insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9060)|
| 2:31:09| Aramark's a large corporation, and they have a large responsibility to the public, and so much is expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9069)|
| 2:31:18| So I think that's a good move forward for us because we do have that provision in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9078)|
| 2:31:25| It is unique, so we did give some extra time to be able to put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9085)|
| 2:31:30| And in our discussions with the university and also with Aramark in crafting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| we learned that there are some connectivity issues, I guess, in the stadium that they need to be able to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9095)|
| 2:31:42| We did give them some more time to deal with that, but it is still in the measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| And so I think this is a creative solution to a problem that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| There is one amendment that I would like to offer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9112)|
