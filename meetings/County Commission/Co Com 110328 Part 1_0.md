| 0:01:01| right hand, and be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=61)|

| 0:01:08| the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and the help of your God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Mr. Chairman, those present have been sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Discussion and possible action against beer permittees that are delinquent in paying their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| annual beer privilege tax and Knox County business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| MEJ, LLC, Choteau Marina, 12214 Choteau Marina Way, on and off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=81)|
| 0:01:28| Is there someone here from Choteau Marina representing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| My name is Mike Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| I'm an attorney here in Knox County, and I'm here on behalf of these entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| I am informed that except for the $100 fee that all delinquent taxes have been paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=98)|
| 0:01:48| my understanding from speaking with my client this morning is that they wanted to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| sure that this body was satisfied that everything else had been paid, and then they would pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| this $100 fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| It is my understanding in conversation with the clerk that that is correct, that the delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| business tax fees are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| What remains is the $100 beer privilege tax, and that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| That's all that's correct, Ms. Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Under those circumstances, I can assure this body that the $100 tax will be paid by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| end of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Yes, question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Oh, yes, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Could you, and I know you may not be in a position, but could you enlighten us as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| why they got behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Was it a correspondence issue, a bad address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| My understanding is that there was some confusion about exactly where they were supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| pay their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| What my client explained to me was that they had been paying certain of these taxes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| the county clerk, and found out later that the law had been changed, and they were supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| to be paying them directly to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| And that's what created the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| This is not a question for out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Unless someone has a question for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Again, thank your client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| We appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| This is just directed at us, fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| Something went wrong, and it cost us a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| I hate to expose UK to the interstate, but we probably made a couple of trips out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| when we really didn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| So I don't know if there's some other discussion that we need to have about do we do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| different in the future or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| I just want to make sure that we do have before us that question that, is there something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| we need to do before next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| Not today, but before next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Yeah, I think we ask the law director to look into adding a $50 or a sum of money late fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| on the $100 if it's legal, and he's going to bring that back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| And that's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| I just want us to keep it on our mind that something may need to be done that would help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| fix this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| UK, do you want to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| Mr. Chairman, it was 84-mile total, 22-mile down the first trip and 22-mile back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| I made two trips, and I'm sure that cost the county over $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| Well, at 50 cents a mile, it would be $42, so that doesn't include wear and tear and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=281)|

| 0:09:08| Make a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=548)|

| 0:09:14| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| We have a discussion item on the regulation of the sale of alcohol-based high-energy drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Before we get to that, one point to each of you new permit holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| You need to see Miss Karen Pershing over here with the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| She has a kit for you to help you conform to the laws and regulations and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| So as a point to all the commissioners, each one that's approved now will get one of these kits from the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| So that's the young lady over here in the white sweater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| We can make this one a little bit shorter than what we had anticipated today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| I'm going to try to get a copy of the statute regulating the alcohol beverages and size and alcohol content of flavored malt beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=600)|
| 0:10:12| Karen Pershing just informed me right before we started the meeting that there are already two bills that have been introduced in Nashville to do the same thing that we were wanting to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=612)|
| 0:10:25| So what I would like to make a motion is that we write a letter as the Knox County Beer Board to both of these sponsors of these bills supporting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=625)|
| 0:10:43| I'm sorry, I got a breaking news email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| I wasn't listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Would you repeat that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Say it for me, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| I wasn't paying attention either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| When I speak, nobody listens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| I'm like E.F. Hutton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| I need to put this phone up, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| There are two bills already introduced in the legislature that will do what we wanted to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| So my recommendation and my motion is that we send a letter of support from the Knox County Beer Board to these two bill sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=665)|
| 0:11:14| You're making that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| I would feel more comfortable if we brought it up in commission and added it as an agenda item with the numbers so we know what we're sending them an approval on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=678)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Yeah, Laudrup says it's just a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| So if you'd like, we can add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Do you have the bill numbers, Mr. Pershing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| If we can get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| We'll get them from you after this meeting and we'll add them to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| I failed to say I'd like to discuss this, but the 8th District had a permitee request today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=705)|
| 0:11:54| And it reminds me, I've thought of this question before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| As beer permits change hands, would it be possible for us to know if that location had been stung in the past three or previous three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=719)|
| 0:12:10| as a part of our looking at that, only for me to be able to say if it's a beer permittee in the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| this location has had problems in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| I do not expect problems in the future, but you need to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Is that something that we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| That's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| We'll veto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| If you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| The clerk apparently has a record of that as well, so it's feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| So I would tend to think that I would like to ask that question on all new permittees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| if it's a place where there's been an existing permit before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| I don't know that that's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| I could give you a printout that you could have and update it as there are violations and you could have that on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=768)|
| 0:12:57| Would it be easier for you to, as you do this agenda, just put a line item underneath each one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| no previous problems at this address or two previous problems at this address in 609 and 410 or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=784)|
| 0:13:14| I do not want to point an accusorial finger at the person that's standing here asking for a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| but I would like for us to think about if we were able to say this location has been a revolving door for stings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=800)|
| 0:13:30| Does that sound like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Now then, I've set it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Let me ask out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Oh, he knows which ones to go back to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| We feel that they change hands because we have done a sting on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| and another family member comes in and takes over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| So I have my suspicions that that happens more than you all would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| Okay, so I guess every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| Location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| I shouldn't say a blind hog finds an acorn, but every now and then something needs to be asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| and I think that maybe we're on the same page here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| that we need to maybe know a little bit of the experience of the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| not of the incoming new operator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| but has this been a location that we could have, Knox County, been experiencing problems in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| So I'm not saying that I want us to change any policy or procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| I just want us to maybe think about is that something that we need to do in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| You know, question the location's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| I think it would be good, too, if Wolfie knows about the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| if it's changing from a brother to another brother or to his mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| to get it out of his hands so it looks differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| I think that would be good information for you to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| When you ask if there are any problems with the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| you can say, well, in the past at this location we've had X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| That's an excellent concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| You just have to bear in mind that if they meet all the legal criteria, it's an educational process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| You know, and quite frankly, you can put them on notice and say you're going to be under heightened scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| because of what's occurred in the past, but, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| I don't see anybody suggesting we use that as a criteria to deny an otherwise lawful permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=930)|

| 0:16:28| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| and the IBEW Local 760 President Lonnie Richard Hundley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Commissioners Norman and Brown, do we have a motion that we approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1003)|

| 0:16:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| And Commissioner Norman, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Mr. Hundley, if you would come forward and you have some people with you, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| Mr. Hundley is one of these examples of folks that has been in his profession for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:13| I think it was somewhere in 1966 he first joined this union of the Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:21| And so he is obviously an example for his industry, for this profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| He's been president of the local here for a number of years also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| This group of people serves us in many, many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| The resolution has a number of charities that are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| Mr. Hundley has been involved in all these CARM, Salvation Army, Habitat for Humanity, Children's Hospitals, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:52| So this is an example of a union that does this community great service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| and a man who does great service to his local and has for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| We're here to honor him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you for the honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| It's a privilege to be before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| I think that this body is doing well and making Knoxville a place to grow and prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:23| If you prosper, we prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| I have been president for 29 years, training on the training committee for 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| We are a local of many different facets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| We have 1,800 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| Of those 1,800 members, we have 400 from Y-12, X-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| We have eight different utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| We have 600 from construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| We have ADT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1133)|

| 0:19:01| We have TVA construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| So we are a fairly diverse local, 12 different counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| We try to stay active in all the counties in the different charities and different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:18| KUB, different utilities, Leno City, Seville County, Appalachia, all stay active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:26| Oak Ridge does a lot of charity work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| We take a pleasure in being from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| I do live in Knox County and I always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| I live in the Gibbs community with Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| We spent a few times in the ball field together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| So I greatly appreciate this honor and thanks to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1190)|

| 0:20:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| No presentation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1222)|

| 0:20:38| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1238)|

| 0:20:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| I had asked the ex-chief to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| Maybe since he's ex-chief, he lost his parking card, so he may be looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| He's probably on the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| But it may be too cold and rainy to be on a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| I'd like to defer this for a little bit and see if he comes, if that's okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| Certainly, when you see him, just let me know and we'll recognize him at the proper time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1268)|

| 0:21:15| This is Resolution 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1279)|

| 0:21:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Commissioner Braws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| There are way, way too many women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| If I tried to give out an individual resolution to every woman who's had an influence on county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| so I'm not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| But I would like this read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| And I would like to say that the previous commissioners who were women have been good role models for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:49| and I have appreciated their guidance over the last two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| And as much as I enjoy working with you guys, it gets kind of lonely up here being the only female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1314)|
| 0:22:03| And I hope that in the future the voters of the county will seek to put more women on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1323)|
| 0:22:11| but only for you guys who are term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| I'm not asking that anybody run against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| But I do want to thank all the women who have come before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| and we've got one out in the audience right now who I think has been a really tremendous leader in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| Suzanne, do you want to stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| So I'm glad that she's here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| So I would just like this read into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Whereas countless women have steered the course of our nation by standing resolute to the face of adversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| and by overcoming obstacles to realize their full measure of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| And whereas Women's History Month is an opportunity for the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| to recognize the contributions that women have made to our county, our state, and our nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| and to honor those who place trails for women's empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1378)|

| 0:23:15| by dedicating their lives to building a more just society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| And whereas despite these contributions, the role of American women in history has been consistently overcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:26| by undervalued in their literature, teaching, and the history of American history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| And whereas when women reach their full potential through hard work, determination, and leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| our country as a whole prospers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| The commission of Knox County hereby recognizes March as Women's History Month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| and encourages all Knox County citizens to acknowledge and celebrate the many contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| and achievement of women in our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Be it further resolved that if any notifications are to be made to effectuate this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| then the county clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of this resolution to the proper authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Let's go back to Resolution 103, and Commissioner Brown, I believe Mr. Owen is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| Mr. Owen, if you'd come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:41| It's my pleasure, and I'm sure Brad's is too today, to make the presentation of this resolution for, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| ex-chief Owen now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| I told him you were late because you'd lost your parking card when you were ex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| and you were looking for a parking spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| But anyway, last Thursday he was honored over at the Civic Ballroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| about 200 or 300 people over there, maybe more, I'm not sure which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| but extolling his virtues for the fine and outstanding job that he's done for the citizens of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| and also Knox County for the last seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| So in his honor, I ask him to come here today to be recognized before this body and those present today with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:25| And I'm not going to take time to read it, Chief, but anyway, this will go in your scrapbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| and it won't do you a whole lot of good on the golf course, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1530)|
| 0:25:39| As you all know, I did work for Chief Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| But he came at a time when Knoxville Police Department needed him, his leadership style,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| his selflessness, and his encouragement of everybody in that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| He has a knack of seeing you one time and knowing your name and knowing your family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| and that means a lot to policemen and firemen and people in public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| But Chief Owen came at a great time, at a time where we needed him, and he served us very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| I wouldn't say that publicly if I still worked for him for the backlash I would receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| but since I don't work for him anymore, I'll say that he was the chief that we needed for such a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| And, Chief, I do appreciate what you brought to Knoxville through the Park Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| and through being the chief of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| Just one final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Even though we joke about his playing golf, he's not quitting being involved in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| He's still very active with the Metropolitan Drug Commission and some other things around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| He's going to be a fixture here and very much well needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| So, Chief, Ex-Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| Thank you very much, and I sincerely appreciate this and the recognition that goes along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| Obviously, you don't come into a job looking for these types of accolades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| but at the same time, I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| It was a wonderful experience for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| It was a wonderful experience working with the Sheriff's Department as well as commission and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| So I just want to thank everyone here today for making this possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| To Mike and to Brad, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| And I appreciate everything that this city and county has given me so far, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=1634)|

| 0:35:55| And, Clerk, if you would call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2157)|

| 0:36:05| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Commissioner Shouse. We do have a quorum. We begin with our devotional from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| Anders, followed by the Pledge to the Flag from Commissioner Boyles. Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| Yes, you know, it's been a tough couple of years on us on commission as we have learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:25| the inner workings of government. I've kind of been looking for the right words to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| here and I came to the book that holds all the truths, in my opinion, and I found Philippians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| 2, 3, and 4. And it says, do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| in humility, value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but to each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| of you in the interest of others. I think that's our job here. That's our definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| of service that we have on commission. I think it makes us to where we should be selfless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| and I think that's the direction that we should go and not be thinking of no one is bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| than the, you know, no single person is bigger than the whole itself. I think that's spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| very well in that verse. Let's pray. Father, we come to you today thanking you for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| freedom that we have in a country as great as America that we can come and have our differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| and have our votes and things cast without fear of reprisal and fear of what we believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:25| Father, I thank you for the blessings you've bestowed on us as a community and I thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| you for everything that you have given to us and to me and my family. Lord, I pray that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| you'll go with us today as we make decisions that affect other people and that we'll make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| them with the best intentions and the best heart. I pray these things in Jesus' name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| Amen. Commissioner Brawls. If you would please stand and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| Salute please. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| for all. Our next item is the approval of minutes to the previous meeting. Do I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:14| a motion that they be approved? Motion approved. And there's a second. All those in favor say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| aye. Aye. Minutes are approved. Next, we have amendments to the agenda. I would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:25| on the discussion items, go ahead and remove the discussion about the Solway Green Waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2305)|

| 0:47:19| Ms. Angie, ladies and gentlemen, with the reading of the consent items. I've been asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| by some of the members of the public about these consent items and just for those of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| you watching, many of these items were discussed during our work session last week and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| we have 100% consensus, we put them on what is called the consent agenda and so there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| really no need for us to discuss them here today because they were discussed a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| So that's why we do the consent. Do I hear a motion that we approve the, pardon me, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| Norman, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. There was one on item number 112 on the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:53| We did have a discussion but there were several questions that were unanswered so I assumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| that that would not be on consent and so I would ask that that one be removed from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Okay, we can do that. So for the remaining items, do I hear a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| the consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| They are approved. Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| Just a clarification on item 110. Commissioner Norman, did you seek to have that withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:28| That was about the appointments to the three ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| Withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:31| Yes, it has deferred so that was withdrawn. So if there's no objection to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| that's going to be withdrawn from the agenda. So let's go to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| Okay, on page 2, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| creating a committee to assist in the county commission redistricting process. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Again, for those watching and for those of you here in the audience, during our luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| today, we had a meeting with India Kincannon and Cindy Buttrey with the Knox County Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| of Education. During that time, we were talking about redistricting and it was the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| consensus, only 100% consensus of the commissioners, that we should work together with the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| board to affect this redistricting process so that we don't have, and try to match up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| the districts as closely as possible. And so, they're going to be talking with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| Board of Education to see if they agree and so on number 111, I would like to amend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| to say that pending school board approval, we would have a committee made up of four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| commissioners, four school board members, one representative from the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| one representative from the city of Knoxville. We would have a couple of ex-officio members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| One of them would be Rick Emmett, for example, and a member of the Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| Commission, non-voting members. But the voting members would be the commissioners, the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| board, the representative from the town of Farragut, and the representative of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| of Knoxville. So, I would put that in as a new resolution, I guess, because of our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| today. Again, pending the Board of Education approval of the same resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| I make a motion to approve it. As long as the public is aware that all of these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| will be sunshined and open to the public for comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| And we will also have websites and it will be very, very open and we desperately want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| and need public input. Who was the second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Okay, we'll have Commissioners McKenzie and Brown both second it. All those in favor say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3021)|

| 0:50:50| Motion has been made and seconded. Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Okay, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I'd just like for someone from the Mayor's office to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| some questions about Mr. Quillen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3057)|
| 0:51:08| Tim Burchett, Knox County Mayor, 6401 Airtree, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| Thank you, Mayor. Just wanted to, first of all, wanted to know what the, what's the salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| of this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| I believe it's appointed. I believe it is, there is no salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| Okay, are you sure of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| I'll yield to the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| There is a, yeah, well, the way the Commission set it up, it can exceed $10,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:38| But they're paid $200 an hour in the event they're called into service, which they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| not, to date, been called into service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| Okay, and my other question, I guess, and this is also to Mr. Jarrett, is by statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:56| whose authority is it to make this appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| Well, the way you've got it set up in your code, it's a Mayoral appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| Because the Mayor's office is ultimately going to be working with the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| to issue notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Those people who receive a notice of violation are entitled to a due process hearing, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| that's where the appointed attorney outside of county government comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| Okay, so does Mr. Quirlen, Mr. Quirlen's a, he's an attorney, and I guess, I would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:34| like to know his experience in terms of what would qualify him as a hearing officer in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| this regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Well, of course, he is a lawyer, and I know his character, and that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| Okay, well, tell me about his law experience then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| How about if I get a resume for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Would that be appropriate, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Yes, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| I mean, I'm not a lawyer, so I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| Okay, given this, I would just like to defer this appointment for 30 days until we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:06| see who this guy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| I've tried to find something out about him, and I just don't know anything about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| Nobody apparently in our law enforcement branch knows anything about him, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| some significant experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| So that would be my secondary motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| Mr. Chairman, I would have gladly brought that material here if I'd have known that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| there was any question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| So I'll have it for you at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| You said substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Okay, so the motion remains seconded, Mr. Mayor, so you'll get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| On page 4, resolution 803, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:52| Tennessee, requesting that the Knox County Commission direct the Knox County Internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| Auditor to orchestrate an audit of the fiscal aspects of the Knox County Drug Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Mr. Law Director, would you weigh in on this and tell us about your conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| the drug court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Yes, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| I learned recently, early last week, that the drug court was meeting the drug court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| board and I appeared at the meeting and I was well received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| I didn't announce that I was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| But I ultimately discussed with the board the fact that obviously with some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| that have occurred relative to the drug court, there are some credibility issues and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| questions as to their accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| I recommended to them that they should consider, one, agreeing to an audit of a fiscal audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| of their operation just so we can get a handle on exactly what public monies are being expended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| and in what manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| And secondly, that they should also consider a clinical audit through perhaps the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| They've agreed to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| And normally, in a perfect world, we would wait two months or bring this to the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| But I feel time is of the essence, especially when you have a change in leadership as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| as high profile as important as the drug court, that a fiscal audit would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| It would be de minimis cost because the internal auditor is more than qualified to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| And drug court has given me the assurance they will agree and otherwise cooperate fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| But I'll defer to the wisdom of the commission on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110328part1?start=3323)|
