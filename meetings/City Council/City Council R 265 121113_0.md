| 0:00:04| not Madeline Rajero. She is on business and we'll discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=4)|
| 0:00:08| later but I wanted to go ahead and call this meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=8)|
| 0:00:11| We'll have the invocation by Councilman Campin and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=11)|
| 0:00:16| pledge by Councilman Delvopi. We're thankful this evening for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=16)|
| 0:00:22| the opportunity to serve Knoxville and our fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=22)|
| 0:00:24| citizens. Please let us work together with an open mind and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=24)|
| 0:00:28| open ears to listen to all viewpoints and opinions. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=28)|
| 0:00:32| Veterans Day week, we're deeply respectful and honor all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=32)|
| 0:00:35| who have served this country and those who are on active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=35)|
| 0:00:38| duty protecting our freedom, giving us the opportunity to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| here today. Amen. Dress the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=42)|
| 0:00:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| Ms. Mitchell, if you'll call the roll, please. Councilman Brown. Here. Councilman Campin. Here. Councilman Delvopi. Here. Councilman Grieve. Here. Councilman Palmer. Here. Vice Mayor Pavlis. Here. Councilman Saunders. Here. Councilman Steyer. Here. Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=61)|
| 0:01:19| We have a quorum. The minutes were distributed prior to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| meeting. I'll open it up for a motion for approval of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| minutes. So moved. Second. All those in favor of the motion say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| aye. Aye. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| We'll go with are there any items to be withdrawn? Mayor Brown. Yes, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| want to make a motion to withdraw item 11K. Second. You want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=103)|
| 0:01:51| to talk about the issue there? Well, in talking with the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=111)|
| 0:01:59| chief, I think that's going to maybe be revisited. Okay. Maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| we worked out a little bit. So, for now, we'll make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| that we withdraw it. Okay. All right. There's a motion on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| floor. Okay. And there's a second. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| That's an old line, I assume. Not all those in favor, aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| So be it. Items for postponement. Councilman Delvaux. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I'd like to move that we postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| item 12C. It is the ordinance on crematories, columbariums, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| funeral establishments and that it be postponed. I was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| suggest four weeks. I am told by people in the audience that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| we're going to be right smack in the holidays and maybe have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| trouble getting folks together. If I could put it off until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| first or maybe the second meeting in January. I hate to do that. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| think ordinarily four weeks would be plenty, but I'm afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| the holidays will prevent us from really getting everyone we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| to, including people from MPC and other officials. So, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| could find a date in mid-January. January 22nd, I think is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| second meeting. All right. Well, I'll make that motion. I hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| that it's that long, but I think that. Second. That's a proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| motion. It's been seconded. Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| Not all those in favor, say aye. Aye. Any items to be added by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| motion? And then I'll go to the consent items. 12M. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=214)|
| 0:03:43| Second. Councilman DelVolpe, is that a line? I'm sorry. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| It's been. I moved this. I see that. And properly motioned and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| second. All those in favor of the consent item, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| I will go to the mayor's report. Mayor O'Hara obviously can't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| here tonight because she's up in New York along with staff from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| the Office of Sustainability to participate in an ideas camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| sponsored by the Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayor's Challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| And last week, as you all heard, Knoxville was named as just one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| the 20 finalists in the Mayor's Challenge. And that's out of more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| of 400 cities that applied. And that's a real honor. We're the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| only city in Tennessee that was chosen. So the winners won't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| announced until early next year. There will be one $5 million grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| and four $1 million grants. But the mayor's up there this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| meeting with the other finalists and exchanging ideas on how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| make all of our cities better in place for everybody. So I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| it's a win-win situation. I mean, obviously, we'd be honored. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| we've got our fingers crossed that we'll be one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| recipients of that. But at a minimum, we've got great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| recognition. And the mayor will bring back along with her staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| I'm sure, some good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| Also, last week on Election Day, our city charter amendment on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| pension plan passed with 76% of the vote. And this was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| obviously that all of us on council along with the mayor, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| a lot of people in the administration worked very hard on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| for many months. It's good to see that the work paid off. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| thank you for everybody's time and effort on this. I know many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| council members were out there in the weeks before the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| talking about the pension and encouraging people to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| new plan. Thanks to the employee groups for all of their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| And especially thanks to the voters who took the time to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| the issue and understand it and to read all the way to the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| the long battle. We were unfortunately at the very end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| it. So there's a lot of concern about that. But we all know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| still have challenges to come in terms of the demands of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| existing pension plan. But this puts us on a new and better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| footing for the future. And I just also want to mention some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| good news in the first district while I've got the mic. On| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| November 1, we had an event on a beautiful day at Iams Nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| Center where they announced the acquisition of 22 more acres. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| that brings the total of 300 acres. So to give you some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| perspective, Central Park in New York City is about 840 acres. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| 300 acres in South Moxville is not bad. Iams has added an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| additional three miles of new multi-use trails built by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| Appalachian Mountain Bike Club, which has done such great work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| in helping build our urban wilderness, contributing to South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| Moxville and this whole region as a whole. And there's other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| reports of Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| Thank you. I have two things. This past Friday, the Westview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Historical Cemetery District received an award for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| preservation from the East Tennessee Historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| Preservation Society. Also at that recognition was the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| Port Assisted Living Facility that came about as a conversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| from the school. So Knox County did very well in that. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| quite a surprise to the Westview District to get that award. On| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| May, November 2, Mayor O'Hara, Mayor Burchett, Margaret Gater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| and I participated in the formal launch of that district. So to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| go a week later and get an award was something of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| surprise. The other thing has to do with Cumberland Estates. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| there is an emergency preparedness initiative for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| neighborhoods. Certainly after the great shake we had on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Saturday, and some of the storms that have taken place in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| parts of the country and some tornadoes here, we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| understand our neighborhoods need to be prepared. So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Thursday, November 15, at the Rec Center at Cumberland Estates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| at 630, those neighborhoods will be participating in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| preparedness meeting so that they will be prepared down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Right. Thank you very much, Councilman Dalbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Thank you, Vice Mayor. I had two things, but I want to add a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| third and springboard off what Councilwoman Palmer just said. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| had the occasion to be up in the Northeast this weekend, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| there are just communities that are devastated. I mean, in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| second week without power, people not having gas to get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| their car to get to work. And it's obvious that that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| even though it has lots of facilities and things in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| could not cope with it. And I think preparedness at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| neighborhood level is really important because it's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| now, it's mostly neighbors helping neighbors get out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| hole until they can get the official help to rebuild all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| utilities and everything else. And so this is a good approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| that we need to have it in the grassroots level where we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| look out for each other. Two quick things. One is the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| app has now been created in a beta form and is being debugged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| but we are really close. And I'm excited because I think not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| will travelers coming to our city have just an instant list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| in their hand or in their computer, their laptop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| whatever, but I think the residents are going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| to have really good information at their fingertips. And a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| of us set out to do something like dine or whatever and don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| even have a concrete plan. And now someone not driving the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| can actually navigate and find out things that they need. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| think that's going to be a good tool. And finally, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| really something for the police department, but I was at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| meeting at Town Hall East last night and they get a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=559)|

| 0:09:25| emphasize, and I want to mention this to our residents who maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| are watching at home, that the holidays bring opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| for crimes of opportunity, in essence. And be sure to lock the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=572)|

| 0:09:53| for opportunities to come in and break in your house or your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| car, and you need to be helpful in avoiding that. And also keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| an eye on your neighbors, because if something's unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| going on, call that 911 number, or call the non-emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| number, and that was, was it 4010, what is it, 215-4010?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| Officer? Yes, sir, it's 215-4010. And let the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| know, because they can start following up before the bad guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| leave. So use common sense. That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Councilman Gray. Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| to everyone's attention that the county is in the process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| looking at their sign ordinance and their billboards. And this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| is coming before county commission at their, possibly at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| their next meeting. I don't know what happened today at their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| committee meeting. But one of the things that they're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| at is following in the footsteps of the city in terms of banning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| billboards and EMCs. And so I think it's imperative that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| folks who are interested one way or the other should contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| their county commissioners and look into this and see, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| know, what, what is being done. One thing that, that I've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| all along is that when someone comes into Knoxville, you really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| don't know whether you're in Knox County or you're in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| when you drive down Kingston Pike. And of course, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| folks know how I feel about the billboard situation. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| that what Commissioner Briggs is trying to do is also bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| line with the county in terms of the billboard situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| They're not trying to take down the existing billboards. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| not trying to put anyone, you know, out of business that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| already has the billboards. But what they're looking at is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| they're trying to preserve the natural beauty that we have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| only, not only in the city, but also in the county. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| it's imperative that the citizens let their commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| know how they really feel about this and voice their opinion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| that. So I just wanted to bring that up, that that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| coming up in county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=709)|

| 0:14:22| Yes. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I just wanted to note this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| and the next three. I really, really appreciate KUB's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| proactive stance in informing us by way of the packet that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| sent along to us that really helped explain what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| And I think we pretty well knew anyhow. But thank you so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| for sending that along. And thank Ms. Roach, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| please. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Yes. Thank you. I'd like the gentleman from KUB to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| here. We have the package, and I think it's great, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| we need, our citizens need to know. And we have basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| four bond issues that are refunding bonds, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| trying to get advantage of lower interest rates, lower costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| which mean lower costs to the consumer. Is that a fair thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| And tell us who you are and a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Yes, sir. My name is Mark Walker. I am CFO of Knoxville Utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Board. I live at 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Yes, sir, you are correct. We've identified in total for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| four series $172 million in bonds that we sold back in 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| and 2006. As you know, interest rates remain historically low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| So we can take advantage of those low rates, refinance those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| bonds that were sold in 2005 and 2006 at much lower interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| rates, and save, over the life of the bonds, about $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| So those are incremental. Each year you save a portion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| That is correct. All right. The second question I have is, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| it fair to say that these refunding bonds look to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| revenues of KUB and not the taxpayers of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| or its credit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| That is correct, sir. The bonds are secured solely by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| revenues of KUB. The bondholders will have no recourse against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| the taxation power of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| I thought the taxpayers would like to know that. But thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| very much for what you guys are doing. Keep your eye on the ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| and it's helping. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=976)|

| 0:21:22| increasing a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1282)|

| 0:21:26| explain what we're doing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1286)|

| 0:21:32| full-time employee of our own sort of doing maintenance so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| they're going to hire one or they're going to take it under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1294)|

| 0:21:45| back to 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| It's a 25-year agreement, and that was when the golf course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| was first constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Really no money tied in with that particular agreement, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| in 2007, we entered into a five-year agreement where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| were providing $40,000 a year to help supplement the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| employing a greenskeeper or a superintendent as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1322)|

| 0:22:10| And that five-year agreement ran out this past June 30th, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| this is a renewal plus an additional $15,000 on top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| the $40,000 to help with additional costs of maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| and additional equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1344)|

| 0:22:28| $55,000 on the other maintenance agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| We're basically renewing it at a little higher price to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| with current costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1353)|

| 0:23:36| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| I don't know if David or someone speaking for him is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Maybe it's Jim Hagerman who's got the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| Is that you, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| That's Joe Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1425)|
| 0:23:45| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| David is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| He's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Sorry, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Old blind man in the back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Hey, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Hey, Dave Brace, Public Service Director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| And I think this is really Joe, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| And then Concho was in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| She's the farm manager, so she can also answer questions if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Just a simple question, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| It reads like we're hiring public building authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| manage the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| Are the figures in here, the $175,000, the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| construction, or just the cost of managing and oversight of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| the construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| It's total project costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| It's the total package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Construction, design, everything not to exceed $175,000 with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| $150,000 coming from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| OK, I apologize, but when I read it, I wasn't sure I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| getting that, and I was afraid there was another bill behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| it, and I wanted it all to be on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| So thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Any other questions for Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Well, let's not let him off that easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| I'll pass it to Joe now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| And I appreciate you bringing this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| I'm just not that overly familiar with the projects that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| went out there today, and I appreciate you giving us this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| So this goes, according to this, you're leaving the basketball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| court that's there, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1504)|
| 0:25:04| This is going to basically where the tennis courts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Yeah, Beardsley is on city property at a city park, a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| that in many ways had not been abandoned, but had lost some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| So many years ago, CAC, Beardsley, AmeriCorps, actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Mr. Harris, if he'll wave in the back, actually helped found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Beardsley Farm as an AmeriCorps employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| And so this is a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| They have a barn that they use as an office and to store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| equipment, and they have a greenhouse, have a chicken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| They don't have a great place to do education and to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| training for the kids and volunteers that come into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| Beardsley, and Colin can talk in detail about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| So this is a building with restrooms and with a classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| and with a place for a kitchen so they can do cooking classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| And again, the basketball court stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| We help provide some additional access for the Boys and Girls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1559)|
| 0:25:59| They have a facility right there as well, and there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| bus issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| So we're going to help provide access for their buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| And then we're going to open it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| It's kind of hidden back in there and open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| So there's more of a front door for Beardsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| And you look for other opportunities to partner with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| I mean, we've done some other public private partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| We just finished one in West Hills where the Tennis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| Association raised a bunch of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| You've looked at opportunities like that and studied some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| grants and try and find other funding before coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| Yeah, there was actually a grant that Susanna Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| through the Sustainability Office and Mayor Rojero applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| for, I believe it was through TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| We were hoping this would be funded through that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| If it wasn't, Mayor Rojero was committed to do it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| the capital process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| We found out, I don't know what the date of the grant was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Joe, probably two months ago, three months ago, that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| wasn't going to be funded through TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| And so we move forward with this project through capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| And you rent now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| It's like some port of Johnny's right now or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| Yeah, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| And actually we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| CAC and Con can come up if you want to ask him real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| She's been there for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Right now there is a porta potty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| And so right now there is an issue with when kids come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| out, there's not a great place for kids and volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| to wash hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| They use, you know, garden hoses and water spigots, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| they do have a restroom, but it's not a fully accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1638)|
| 0:27:18| So that's going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| And I'll let Con introduce herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Hi, I'm Con Chauve, Beardsley Farm Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| You have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| No, it's nice to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Councilman, you're through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Councilman Grady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Yeah, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| I'm not sure who would answer this, but on PBA where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| have the, you said that total is going to be $175,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| $25,000 to be born also by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| I'm curious, what is PBA's fee on this project as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| as the previous one we talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| My understanding is both these projects would be covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| by normal overhead for PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Again, like we discussed last council meeting, significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| projects, for example, the State Street Garage, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| a management fee built into those multimillion dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| There's overhead that's there just having PBA here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| manage this building and other public facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| And so they have staff here that these types of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| and our roof projects are often just, it's part of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| normal overhead to have Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Gallion and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Martin here on a regular basis, Dan Martin, who's their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| construction project manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Jeff is their architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| So my understanding is there's no additional fee for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| city for either of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| What is our budget fee for having PBA oversee these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| kinds of projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1723)|
| 0:28:43| Sounds like a Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| That's a Jim York project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| And I would ask Jim to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| Council Member Grieve, I'm not sure of the exact amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| What we do with PBA is with their facilities, folks, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1736)|
| 0:29:03| split the cost between the city, county, schools, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| And we basically spread that, those costs over a variety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| And for that, for that cost, we cover all the small projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| In fact, we're actually covering the State Street Garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| under that overhead as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| So are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1764)|
| 0:29:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Council Member Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Oh, I just want to say, I think that's going to be a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| addition to the community and a great asset for that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| community and looking forward to its passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Council Member, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Council Member Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Yeah, I started this pot earlier in the week with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| mayor's office, but let me just articulate it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| One of the questions I had was it was jeepers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| That sounds like a lot of money to grow, you know, tomatoes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| potatoes and stuff like that with the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| I realize that you're trying to have an educational facility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| a center that you can do things year round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| But the thought occurred to me, at least when I first saw this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| gosh, you could start a dozen other farms and have money left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| over to buy seeds for 10 years for that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| But I understand that you're trying to do more than just grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| something there, that you're trying to educate people to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| up this practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| Maybe David or Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Cho or Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Walsh could address that because my thought was you could have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| farm in every part of the city for that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| The Delavope farm in my backyard has almost no cost except string| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| and sticks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| So I hope hopefully if you're in your packet there and can talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| in detail, there's, you know, several, almost 1,500, 1,600| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| volunteers that come through the farm, several hundred kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| So it's not just a farm and a plot for community residents to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| have a space for urban agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| It's really a place for kids, especially low-income kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| Beaumont, Lonsdale, Maynard is close, Mechanicsville, to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| in and learn about about healthy produce, how you can grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| healthy produce on a small plot of land, residential land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| And then obviously there's a cooking component, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| You know, nowadays, just if you look at what the Together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Healthy Knox folks are doing, you know, urban produce is 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| percent higher in the city than it is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| And so it's important for folks to be able to learn to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1887)|
| 0:31:27| So I think that's what Kahn's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| That's why this facility is needed, just a restroom that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| You know, if you think that someone comes in that has an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| accessibility issue, not having that restroom facility or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| surface for them to get into the farm, you know, we deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| that on a pretty regular basis with our public facilities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| We don't want to have a problem in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| We need to look ahead at our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| And I know that we're trying to teach someone to fish and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| just hand them fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| And so it's a it's a smart way to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| But I did want to raise that because my first thought was get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| a few lawn chairs from Walmart and a blanket and sit on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| ground and talk to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| But I understand you do this year round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| And so, yeah, I think that I just wanted to bring it out for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| the public to know that that it has a year round use and it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| it has a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| So and Miss Sutherland is also working on we get a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| requests about the restrictions in the city to to community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| farms, to, you know, residential farming and urban agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| And so, you know, part of this, too, is there's times when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| want to route people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| We have people that come to us and say, we want to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| community garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1953)|
| 0:32:33| Well, that that sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| There's a lot of work that goes into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| So we oftentimes refer people to to Kahn and Beardsley so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| can understand the magnitude of managing and running a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| farm. And so that that will probably I see us growing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| capacity some with with Beardsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Now they're going to have a facility and there's a real need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1973)|
| 0:32:53| As an old guy who plays in the dirt, drive some of your trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| with the leaves in it and drop them off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| They make great mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1979)|
| 0:32:59| Just put a little little lime in the spring and you'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| healthier soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| She calls us every leaf season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| We drop about one load for to do some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| So we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1989)|
| 0:33:09| There's been a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Is there further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| If not, all those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| I'm I'll be well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| There is an ordinance amending Chapter five, Article 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Section two dash one one one two of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| regarding the composition and the responsibilities of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| of Knoxville Public Arts Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2010)|
| 0:33:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Just wanted to let council know that I'm the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| representative on this committee and the committee reviewed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| with Mr. Mann, as he may want to have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| And the committee agreed with this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| So I just wanted to pass that on from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| If not, all those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| I so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Both B's and ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| 17, Articles two and six to authorize the imposition of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| fines and the removal and impoundment of non electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| vehicles that are parked in spaces reserved for recharging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| electric vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2048)|
| 0:34:08| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2050)|
| 0:34:10| I just had one question was looking at the sort of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| penalty or at least the prohibition for folks to park in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| a place that's reserved or set up for electric charging when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| they don't have electric vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| Is there some criteria or standard for how long they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| stay there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| In other words, if I have an electric car, can I sneak up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| park it there, charge it for 10 minutes and then get free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| parking all day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| I mean, or do I charge and get out of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Who knows the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| I'll step up and say I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Our Office of Sustainability and fortunately, I'd have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| is is in New York with the mayor with the Bloomberg Challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| And so I don't know what the answer to that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| And I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Jim, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| I have a if I remember correctly, Jim Hagerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| director of engineering, it says while charging, while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| charging and this is on first reading, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| So we can perhaps get that's that's that's pretty detailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2116)|
| 0:35:16| But perhaps we could get well, but people are creative about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| saving money and, you know, you pull up in your in your hybrid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| and you're in, you know, I think it's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| It's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| So we can perhaps get some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| We'll make sure to get that for you before the next reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| OK, there's been a motion and second is a further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Not all those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| I so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Well, the D is an ordinance to change the street name of Keller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| Street between Linden Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Avenue to North and South Dewey Robert Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| That Cultural Exchange Center, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Some of the second thing there's been a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| Let me recognize Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Yes, I wanted to make a motion to amend that to do a Roberts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| OK, that's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| OK, well, we'll come back for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| That's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| And this is just on the name change only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2182)|
| 0:36:22| OK, so there's is there a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| There's a motion a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Is there a discussion on that on the amendment only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| I mean, I'm not with we have and and he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| His son is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2194)|
| 0:36:34| But we want to differentiate between Dewey Roberts Senior and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| Dewey Roberts Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| so that people would not be confused on who the street is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| being named for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Dewey Roberts Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| was the chairman and president of the NAACP for a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| years here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| And Mr. Dewey Roberts Senior was a great educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| So we want to make that difference on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| I grew up in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| I know Mr. Roberts Senior and Junior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| So we wanted to just make sure that people understand who the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| street is named for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| And that's why the request for Senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| So I think that's good clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| So we'll vote on the amendment only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| I still have a comment on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2243)|
| 0:37:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| My concern, I guess, is if with the with the motion to amend is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| the is the comments of MPC that says that our standard signing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| criteria for Knoxville is you can only have two words in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| name of the street and the third word doesn't belong there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Maybe it doesn't fit on signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Maybe it causes confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| But I'm going to call Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Do we not have a standard set of regulations for how we named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| streets and and what criteria there are for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2276)|
| 0:37:56| Mark Donaldson MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| The Planning Commission has adopted administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| that have a long list of criteria for naming streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| including a maximum of two words and and a prohibition against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| abbreviations and contractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| But you are not bound by those administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| They're not codified in the code of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| But they are something that's used to try to have uniformity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| because we have emergency vehicles and all kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| that rely on the names of streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Isn't that why we have the rules to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| That's why we have the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| We developed the rules outside of the scope of the the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| ordinance that was adopted by fleshing them out with with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| rules that we apply when people name streets and subdivisions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Last question then if we if we made this an honorary street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| title as opposed to the official title could we have more words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| and abbreviations and whatever we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| Yes we have no rules regarding honorary street name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| And the reason I ask that Mr. Chairman is there was a there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| was an objection to one of the neighbors who was not consulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| about going through the effort of changing all their personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| belongings and we could still honor Mr. Dewey in his activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| by making it an honorary street title which keeps the name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| Keller but then has a separate sign in honor of or will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| Harvard's described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| That's that's an opportunity for us to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| I see two more lights and we'll assume that they're on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| amendment or OK and I'll go to Councilman Green first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| This just really it does have to do with the amendment but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| has to do with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| I'm not really clear on how we go about changing street names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| and the only question I have I have no problem with the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| being named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| But what happens if the Keller family is still here or that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| this Keller Street was named after somebody of importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| How do we go about making changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| And well it went through the naming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| Well no I'm curious as to how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Airmen stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Mr. Chair I recognize Councilman Starr who chairs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| I mean the process is that there's a public naming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| committee and if people have concerns about renaming the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| street they can be addressed there or when it has to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| I mean as to this street name there was no concerns raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| regarding the Keller name at that meeting and I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| there's anybody here tonight or at our next reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| They'll have an opportunity to to address any concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| the Keller name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Do they go through a historical I mean streets are named after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| certain people for certain reasons and history tells us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| And so I'm just asking whether or not this this committee look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| at the reason the street might have been named that and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| No we're getting a little bit not a little bit out of bounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| of not not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Let me reel it back into the we can discuss that when we go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| to the either amended or not amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Yes I had another comment about the reason for the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| that I did talk today to Bob Coker at 9 1 1 and he said to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| me there would not be he didn't foresee a problem in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| adding senior to that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| The problem sometimes comes in when streets are named for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| People might refer to the old street name but he did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| foresee a problem in changing that to senior and there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Well we don't want to get into all of that but I want to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| that to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Well you know I mean we've got probably two folks here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| have got an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| I mean how is it addressed by our uniform services when when a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| name change like this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| It goes through a long process and it goes through 9 1 1 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| then they for inform all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| They change it in their database and then that changes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| dispatch that goes out to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| As long as you identify yourself please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I'm sorry I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Chief Sharpe of the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| So I mean we get name changes in new streets all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| So it's something we deal with regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| Deputy Chief Gary Holiday Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| I agree too sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Once we make the officers aware of it and it's true our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| will call it by the old name for a certain period of time but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| then the police department on Howard Baker Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| Avenue but a lot of it's just a church street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| So over time we'll get used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2569)|
| 0:42:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2571)|
| 0:42:51| So I don't see any more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| So we're voting on the amendment only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| So all those in favor of the amendment say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| The opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| Now we'll go back to the ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| And I see one like Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| I was at the naming committee when when this piece came up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| one of the questions we did ask was have you talked to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| on these two blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| And they said well almost not quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| And then this this lady Lisa Jackson Durrell and I guess her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| spouse or someone in that family side of things saying look we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| have one or two old people on the block and I'm getting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2614)|
| 0:43:34| And this is going to affect everything we have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| identifies us our driver's license our credit cards our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| bills and we're going to go through all this mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| And why are you doing this to us was their question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| Of course the answer is to honor Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| Roberts and his his contributions to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| I raised the question incidentally before of if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| chose this as an honorary street name that would be like a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| name to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| They wouldn't have to go through the pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| It would be officially Keller Street but there would be signs on every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| intersection saying Dewey Roberts senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| You know it would be a different color sign I guess or something to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| show it's the honorary name and not the official name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| But that's one way of saving those folks the grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| I noticed before MPC there were some questions to the cultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2666)|
| 0:44:26| Will you help the individuals sort of go through all of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| effort to get their identity corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| And there was sort of a yes but I wasn't sure that was 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| percent clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2677)|
| 0:44:37| And maybe Dan Brown knows that or maybe Mark Donaldson can speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| to that if if we have some commitment to help these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| because I was concerned about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| They get the burden of of kind of cleaning up the record behind their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| So in terms of address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| So if someone could address that either Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Donaldson or Dan let me recognize Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| Donaldson first and I'll come back to you Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| In the discussion at the Planning Commission meeting there was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| definitive affirmative answer that they would they would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| And it certainly wasn't a part of the motion that was made to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| recommend this street name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| During the once MPC received the application for the street name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| change we in fact notified all of the property owners with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| property along that street and alerted them to the pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| application and and in response to that got the letter from Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| There was there was general discussion about what could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| done but there wasn't anything definitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| Thank you Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2753)|

| 0:45:57| Roberts today and Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Jackson isn't I don't know if she's here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| I don't think she's here but I think it's been indicated to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| that she's all right now with the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| I don't want to speak for her and her not being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| I could ask if you could recognize Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Could you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| I'd like to make a motion we recognize Dewey Roberts Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| I think he's been in discussion with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| And let's keep in mind this is first reading as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| There will be opportunity if there is further discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| And this wouldn't even come up for my except that we have now a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| citizen saying well this is going to burden me and several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| elders nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| We'll recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Roberts here as soon as he gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2810)|

| 0:47:02| And in regard to the question we have talked to Lisa Avon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| Robbins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2826)|
| 0:47:06| He would be here tonight but he's sick and he asked me to if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| he had any questions just come and ask for me to answer any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| We have talked to Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| It's only a handful of houses on the street and Lisa who I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| known since a baby you know she did have some initial objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| but I think after the meeting we talked and she said you know as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| long as we helped her in terms of any difficulty might have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| changing her address that you know she was OK with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| And again I said I don't speak for her because she is not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| but but she seemed to be all right once we decided that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| would kind of work this thing to to help her or any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| neighbors in the in the in the on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| So so you're you're going to help them get the paperwork done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| to get all their address changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2874)|

| 0:47:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| One of the reasons that the street which wasn't a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| of it would have been a lot of help would have to do with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| some other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2885)|

| 0:48:12| It's not like it's right with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| It's not a I think that takes care of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121113?start=2895)|
