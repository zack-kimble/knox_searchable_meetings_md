| 0:01:29| We pray that you'll be with us as we listen to the presentation and as we discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| possible project before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=100)|
| 0:01:47| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=107)|
| 0:01:59| Madam Recorder, would you please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=119)|

| 0:02:03| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=126)|

| 0:02:10| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=130)|

| 0:02:17| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| All members of the Council being here and present, I stated earlier what our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| It's about the new transit center location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Before we begin with the introduction and turn it over to Mr. Bill Lyons, any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| comments from Councilmembers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Yes, Councilman Woodhull, I saw your light first because I was looking in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| And I'll come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| I just wanted to say that I had a previous engagement, and so I'm going to have to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| in about 30, 35 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| But I do appreciate all the work that's been done on this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| And I also understand that Mr. Zena's son is going to read something toward the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| and I wish I could be here for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| But I do have a copy of it, and I appreciate their efforts to work with the city on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| But I'm going to have to leave, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Councilman Pelos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Well, I have a somewhat facetious comment, but I think we should make note of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| Should we express appreciation to the County Commission for the lovely chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| We are not accustomed to such greenery and flags, and so I just thought it's an unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=199)|
| 0:03:27| experience for us, but it's a nice one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| I'm going to take the flip side of Ms. Pelos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| I'm feeling grumpy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| And I just want to say, if anybody thinks we can actually see what's on these easels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| they're delusional, and frankly, I'd prefer they were moved so we could see the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| You know, I'm grumpy, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| He's grumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| I know you do not wish for me to call you Councilman Grumpy, so I won't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| In response to what Councilman Becker said, I think he's probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| I don't think they're much value, except perhaps this last one, maybe the one with the photos on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| It's too illegible from that distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| But maybe this map, but the rest of them pretty much worthless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| I'd say we ought to just have them take them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| In just thumbing through the actual hard copy of the presentation, I note that some of these same documents are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| and I understand the reasoning for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| and I don't have a problem with them being there unless some folks just have major problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| But it's up to you, Bill, whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| Also, Vice Mayor, I don't want to try to rush the proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| I do want to point out that the public meeting for the Cumberland Avenue process is at 6 o'clock this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| and I don't think that justifies shortening this workshop in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| I just want to make sure that people are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| So if we do get out, maybe there will be some folks that want to go to the public workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| It's at the University Center Auditorium at 6 o'clock, starting at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| I appreciate that announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| If you could do me a favor so that I'm not just perturbed by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| There towards the end there is a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| If you could turn that off for me so that out of the corner of my eye I don't see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| and think that it's your light and you need to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Also, I will note that you do have a copy of a statement that I've been asked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| that Councilman Woodhull had just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| What I've instructed counsel for the individual is that we typically add on public form by unanimous consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| at the end of the program and allow for such comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| And that would be the place that we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| And you also have a hard copy of it in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Councilman Brown, if I may, I'm John Buckingham, and I am counsel for Mr. Zina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| And I would like at this point, before the council starts this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| to say that we feel that the purpose of this workshop should be to provide information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| And the unfortunate event is that this is happening on a night when Mr. Zina is in Rochester, New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| And Mr. King is at home sick, John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| And we would ask the council to not consider this matter at this workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| so that you could actually be provided with information concerning this matter from all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=389)|
| 0:06:37| We'd also like to note, as Mr. Zina has noted in his presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| that it was just last Friday that the appraiser for the city was allowed to come to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| and make his inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| And as far as we know, no appraisal has yet come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| So there's a whole area of information that's not even available to any of the parties in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| especially council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| And let me note for the record your comments are duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| They kind of came a little out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Our workshop are for informational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| We don't take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| This workshop is being arranged and has been arranged through the normal course of our doing workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| And if there's any additional information that you or Mr. King or your client would like for us to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| please feel free to get that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Just to follow up on Mr. Buckingham's statement, I think we do need to make note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| And if there is a way that this council can at a future date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| I'm not necessarily suggesting another workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| but if there's some way at a future date that we can get that input from them, I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| Perhaps not in the context of the hearing or voting on something at a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| We'll just have to see how we can work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| But it would be good to try to do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| I certainly agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| If we're considering taking this man's property, he needs to have a full fair hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Thank you, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| And thank you, council, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| I promise that we will be as timely as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| I, too, want to go to the Cumberland Avenue meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| And we'll get through this with all deliberate speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| It may or may not be the right phrase to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| But we'll go as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| And I think we'll ask as we usually do, but we'll certainly defer to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| If you'd hold questions as long as possible, we can get through as more of it as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| But, you know, we'll just have to play that one by ear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| We're here tonight because we're at a critical point in the siting of the transit center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| which is, as we know, has been in various locations for a number of years due to a number of unfortunate events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| and things beyond a lot of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| We want to be clear how we reach this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| and to clarify why the site that has been chosen by the site selection team we think is a very good site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| We want to address concerns involving rail as well because that's become part of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| and we think we should deal with these in a forthright and frank manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| We began this year, 2006, assuming that the site on State Street was going to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| that we had chosen through a previous process a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Unfortunately, Mayor Haslam announced a number of months ago that costs associated with both construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=556)|
| 0:09:23| and with operating at that site for a variety of reasons having to do with all sorts of cost increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| and the fact that that involved a very difficult slab that had been constructed to meet our obligations with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| that we needed to pursue other sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Right after that, we began reestablishing the site selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| In this case, we made note of, and Councilman Holquist sponsored a charrette,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| which we were glad to attend, dealing with the possibility of rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| There were more and more people expressing interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| We attended that charrette and following that, we took the previous site selection criteria matrix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| and added rail as an explicit criteria in the selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| We also expanded the area of concern enough to bring in a couple of sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| that were beyond the original core of downtown definition so that there could be a fair hearing for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| What we have done in this point, and I'm going to turn this over to Jeff Gallion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| has gone through another extensive process involving, led by Jeff at PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| along with the site selection team, with transit experts and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| and consulting closely with the folks at Knoxville Area Transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| because this is still primarily about a place for folks to transfer from one bus to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=639)|
| 0:10:47| The way it fits in both with siting and with routing from CAT, of course, is of critical concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| What I'm going to do is turn this over to Jeff, who's going to introduce the selection team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| review the process we went through, and we're going to spend a lot of time explaining this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| I think better than has been explained to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| There will be some visuals of this, some concept drawings, a master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| so you can see what, in fact, this site that we have does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| We'll also review the reasons, the five finalists, and the reasons that this site was chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| over the other that were in the five, I guess, finalists, quarter finalists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| and then the semi-finalists were the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| So I'm going to turn it over to Jeff right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| And, again, we're going to endeavor to get through this thing as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| Be respectful of your time, but we want to answer all questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| and make sure we deal with everything that we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| So, again, thanks a lot for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| Thank you, Vice Mayor Brown and council for giving us the opportunity to present this information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| My name is Jeff Galliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| I'm the project manager for the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| I'm going to go through real quick, and I'm going to let you hear from the experts on where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| And I'm going to talk about the overview first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| The first person you're going to hear from is Gretchen Von Grossman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| She is our transit consultant, one of our transit consultants out of Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| The next person you're going to hear from is Doug Burton with NBC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| followed up by Mike Carberry of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| And then following that will be Dawn Michelle Foster of Wilbur Smith & Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| who will talk more in depth about the siting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| So I want to go ahead and get to that quickly so you all can start getting that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| So the first person up is Gretchen Von Grossman with Von Grossman & Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| to talk about transit in general and what makes successful projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=756)|
| 0:12:45| Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| I want to start out by saying that the success of transit in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| is exactly what has led to the proposal for this project to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| CAT is a highly successful transit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| and they were rewarded for that success in 2004 by being named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| American Public Transit Association Provider of the Year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| which is quite a national honor among transit systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| They have been planning for this facility for a number of years and growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| The system is growing the entire time that this planning has gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| There's a clear need when you look out at what's happening on Main Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| at the transfer facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| The curbside loading is inefficient for transit operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| and starting to limit CAT's ability to grow and serve its patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| It's unsafe for traffic operations on Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| and it's unsafe in that it encourages pedestrian and vehicle conflicts along Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| The new facility that's being proposed will provide 20 bus bays of off-street loading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| and that will greatly improve transit efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| It will greatly improve safety for passengers as they can make transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| across a single platform to any bus in the CAT system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| There will be passenger amenities that don't exist today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| weather-protected waiting areas, facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| There will be CAT offices that CAT is in great need of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| and it will support CAT operations and future growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| I understand I've talked to a number of people in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| who look forward to the day when rail service will return to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| and our team has consistently looked for opportunities to link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| to the possibility of future rail service in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| Over the several years that we've looked at sites in the downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| we've not been able to identify a feasible site to combine this bus transfer facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| with future rail service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| So to highlight the clear and immediate need for bus transit in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| I want to reiterate this facility is a clear next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| in the maintenance and growth of CAT's system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| I want to also highlight for you that transit systems and transit facilities in cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| grow and evolve over time, and that the construction of this bus transfer facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| is a great first step in growing CAT's transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| If you look at cities and how their systems evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| with strong growth in ridership from a beginning bus transfer system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| they create enough demand for additional modes of transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| whether it be bus rapid transit or rail in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| It's reasonable to expect that the Knoxville station that's being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| would serve a 15 to 20 year lifespan before being supplemented by another transit facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| and perhaps that would be in support of rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| I also want to highlight for you that the best way to achieve this desired future rail service in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=966)|
| 0:16:13| is to support this facility, the construction of this bus transfer facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| and support building ridership on CAT's existing system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| The successful implementation of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| and the growth in transit ridership that will follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| is the best and perhaps only way to show the Federal Transit Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| that investment in Knoxville transit is a sound investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| Next we have Doug Burton with the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| and Doug is going to talk about the regional transportation study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| and looking at other modes of transportation and how that might interface with what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1013)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| I've been a planner at MPC for over 17 years, primarily focused on transit planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| I had the honor of working on a study called the Regional Transportation Alternatives Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| It was an outgrowth in the late 90s of a group of citizens that got together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| that said we really need a regional vision for transit in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| It was chaired by then State Senator Bud Gilbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| and it had a lot of people on the committee including representatives of TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| the city of Knoxville, and some of the other, like the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| and some of the other community organizations in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| The purpose of the study was, like I said, to identify a regional mass transit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| that could work for our area, and we wanted to look at all the major corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| travel corridors, and see what type of transit service could work in there today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| and in the future looking out to 2030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Like I said, our organization was in charge of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| We hired a multidiscipline consulting team led by Wilbur Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| We had extensive public involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| It was a 10-county area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| We went out into all the different counties and talked to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| about the different forms of mass transit which might be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| and it was concluded in the year 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| The main crux of it was we really looked at a lot of GIS data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| We looked at all the population levels, the densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| We looked at employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| We looked at tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| We looked at the hotel and motel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| We looked at the travel patterns, and we took this data, what exists today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| and we forecasted out to the future and compared it to national standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| of what type of transit could best work in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| We looked at bus, express bus, bus rapid transit, light rail, and commuter rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| The analysis quickly found out there's five counties in our area that were just too rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| that a mass transit system is not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| There just wasn't enough mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| But it also identified that in Anderson, Blount, Knox, Loudon, and Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| it would be appropriate for a regional transit concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| It found that the best types of services, whether connecting Knoxville to Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| or Knoxville to Alcoa or Alcoa to Oak Ridge or up into Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| would be using bus and express bus and bus rapid transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| If you're not familiar with bus rapid transit, it's very much like light rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| It's a rubber-tired bus and exists on a right-of-way separated from the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| and it has stations just like light rail, but they use the rubber-tired system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| It's a lot cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| It's about a tenth of what it costs to build a light rail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| The analysis of the market for looking at light rail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| the study found that at this time there just was not any mass out there that could support light rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| It did leave open the possibility that light rail could be done in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| but it said we're really going to have to change the way we do our development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| look at our zoning, and look at the way our parking strategies are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| to generate that mass or that demand for light rail transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| Like Gretchen said, in communities you have to kind of climb the ladder of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Most places just don't jump right from roads to light rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| They put the bus service out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| They fill the buses up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Then they move to the next higher level of capacity transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| They fill those up until they get to light rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| The RTAP study was adopted by the Knoxville Regional Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| It's a multi-county transportation planning body that Councilman Brown and Mayor Haslam sit on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| so it was adopted as part of their long-range plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1221)|
| 0:20:29| The next person we have up is Mike Carberry with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| and he's going to talk about the downtown vision and how the Crandell and Arambula plan works into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1232)|
| 0:20:44| Several months ago, Jeff Gallion and the consulting team came to MPC and TPO staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| and presented the various sites that were being considered at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| and asked for our view as far as pros and cons regarding the various sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| There's not any site in a site selection process I don't think is ever completely ideal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| but we saw some shortcomings as far as walking distance into the balance of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| queuing spaces for the buses with those particular sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| We essentially set a what-if scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| We realized that the Church Street Bridge was scheduled for reconstruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| and for many years a connection from downtown to the Morningside area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| which had been separated since urban renewal days and separated that community from downtown, was possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1290)|
| 0:21:38| I can remember years ago working with Morris Tullock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| and we played that what-if scenario and the idea of a freeway park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| not unlike some places like Seattle, was even discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| Then we go into the work of Crandell and Arambula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| and they began to capture some of that connectivity issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| the connections of downtown to the east with the bridge expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| We looked upon the potential for the transit facility with a widened bridge to be the queuing space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| and some of that connective tissue, if you will, into the Morningside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| Part of their experience in looking at downtown was the development of a development capacity diagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1334)|
| 0:22:23| You have that before you, and I think it explains some of the opportunities for future development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| In looking to the south, and with the work on the south waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| a large portion of that work is underway toward realization, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| Then in looking to the east, they looked upon a cultural and tourism connection along Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1360)|
| 0:22:48| and then an economic and employment framework for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| which included office development along the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| and then finally retail development with facilities within the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| We at MPC could see this being a greater mixed-use area with even residential included in that mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| and go to the vacant land east of Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| We realized that here's an asset as far as a land resource being James White Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1398)|
| 0:23:26| that is in the public realm, so to speak, but air rights development is a potential in relation to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| We've seen that with, again, Seattle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Atlanta has done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Columbus, Ohio has done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Minneapolis and Duluth have done it to make those connections from their downtown districts to adjoining districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1418)|
| 0:23:46| When one looks at one of these criteria as far as the walking distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| and if we're minimizing the travel time from a transit location into major portions of a development area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1430)|
| 0:23:58| and look at the major blocks that are left in downtown, which are along the James White corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| and these are seen in the bright reds on the development capacity diagram that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| you can see the County State Street site, the new Sentinel site, the Prior Brown site as major areas for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1448)|
| 0:24:18| And then you have the towers, First Tennessee and BB&T, the future movie theater along Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| and some of the court resources also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| All the development within the Civic Coliseum Morningside area would be within that walking distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| So we felt that, in short, that the site merited more attention as far as a potential look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| and I think that's what people will be speaking to after I'm finished here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1483)|
| 0:24:56| The next thing we want to go into is the purposes and needs and the siting feasibility study process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1496)|
| 0:25:07| and Dawn Michelle Foster with Wilbur Smith and Associates is going to guide us through that portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1507)|
| 0:25:16| Good evening, Vice Mayor Brown and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| If you look at the purpose and need, you have those probably in your handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| The purpose and need for a downtown transit center facility is basically what we've been studying for the past 20 years here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| If you can remember, back in 86, there was a bus transfer site on Gay Street between Union, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1531)|
| 0:25:39| and from there, after that, I think it transferred or was relocated to Summer Place in Walnut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| That site was a temporary site for the city for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| After that, we had the construction of the Market Street Garage, which moved that site to where it is now at Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| being another temporary site, as we say, for the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| When reviewing those past siting studies, what we looked at in purpose and need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| we addressed the placement of the area of the transit facility into the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| and we also looked at areas that fringed the downtown area to connect to downtown uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1570)|
| 0:26:18| city attractions as the old city, UT, and, of course, Gay Street and hospital areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1578)|
| 0:26:26| When we looked at the 2000 Linkages Study, we did a connection into looking at connecting it to downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1586)|
| 0:26:38| and making a transit center a focal point to connecting neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| We looked at Mechanicsville, Morningside, looked at UT again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| looked at Fort Sanders area and the 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| And we also introduced the term linkages to connect the downtown transit center as a focal point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| by using trolleys as your connecting linkage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| And, again, we introduced intermodal options, be it bicycle, pedestrian enhancements with sidewalk improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| and other streetscape improvements to connect that area into downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| But what you have to realize, in all these siting studies, in our purpose and need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| when you look at that list, we're talking about urban design, bus and trolley enhancements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| parking and traffic, and rail and other intermodal opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| When we looked at the RTAP study, the downtown Knoxville area was still a focus as a linkage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1648)|
| 0:27:37| be it by bus or be it by bus, which was a consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| but still using the downtown area as a linkage for regional traffic with transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| When you look at these studies, they still talk about providing a permanent facility for your bus patrons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| by offering driver and passenger amenities with waiting areas and indoor facilities such as restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| Mostly, you could also provide your bus patrons and drivers safety and security on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| We also introduced, like I said before, intermodal opportunities, be it by bus or pedestrian, via walkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1692)|
| 0:28:22| But another thing to realize, looking at your purpose and need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| we looked at the city planning initiatives in every siting study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| We kept that in mind, be it the Crandall-Arambula study, be it the downtown linkages study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| be it the CAT 2010 action plan, and I could go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| The downtown sector plan, we included all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| And those city initiatives even identified the need for a downtown bus transfer center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| as a focal point, as a starting point for your downtown public transportation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1728)|
| 0:28:56| But most importantly, what it involved was a public involvement process, a very extensive public involvement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| be it with area stakeholders, be it with CAT board, be it with city council like you here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| I mean, very, very extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| And based on our lessons learned and collected information for the previous siting studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| Jeff will probably go into the siting evaluation matrix a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| But in that siting evaluation criteria, and based on our experience from the previous siting studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| we had a modified evaluation criteria, and we just identified with the 22 sites that were added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1767)|
| 0:29:36| looking at previous studies from the 1993 study, the 2000 linkages study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| and combining the 2004 study, we had 34 sites that we reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| So saying that, Jeff, you can come up and give us an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1785)|
| 0:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| We're going to go ahead and get into the site evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| And one thing we've got up on the screen right now are just some key dates about the public process that we've gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| These are, I guess, milestones and steps that have to be taken to satisfy the public involvement process with FTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1807)|
| 0:30:18| These are the minimum standards, and we've done a lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| Are those meant to be 2006, those first few dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| You're correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Wrong year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Don't double your reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| The map that you're looking at now is a location map showing all of the sites that were studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| And one thing we've done here to give you a perspective is to show you the State Street site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| and the Church Avenue Bridge site with the transit bus bay laid out to give you an idea of the scale of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1856)|
| 0:31:08| And when you look at that scale in relation to potential sites downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| there just aren't a whole lot of sites that can accommodate the CAT program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| So that's an informational piece of literature for your viewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| The next, this is pretty difficult to read up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| This is the site matrix that was developed for all 34 sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| If you look down, you'll see 33 sites, but there's a 10A and a 10B, so there's actually 34 sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| All of the sites were evaluated based on this matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| There's a lot of criteria across the top, and even within some of the headings, there are subcategories within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1906)|
| 0:31:56| A ranking system was developed in each one of those to try to make this as objective as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1916)|
| 0:32:05| And for the first time, we actually added the rail proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| A site got a bonus for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| So in previous studies, it had been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| What was the maximum number of points that you could get for the rail bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| Was it 1.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| It was 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Compared to some of the other categories that go up to how high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| What's the highest number for some of the other categories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| It's accumulation on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| For instance, I think that is the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| We have different columns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I see five in some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Is that the highest number in that particular column?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| So that's this matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| We'll be happy to go into any detail you want on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| It's pretty complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| But, again, it was set up to be as an objective evaluation criteria as we could come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| Can you provide legible copies of this to the council at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| And why are so many of the spaces blank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| Some of the sites fell out because, for instance, one of them was the convention center site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| So it was pretty obvious we weren't going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Well, we don't think we're going to do anything with the convention center right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| So those had what is called fatal flaws, which are just obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| Have you thought about turning the convention center into a transit center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| Have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| The old convention center was looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| It was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| Out of the first matrix comes the second matrix, which is the summary, which totals the numbers up into the various categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2024)|
| 0:33:53| And then it establishes a ranking system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| And so what we did was we looked at the top five for further evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| And you'll see the point system is fairly close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| But when we looked at those sites that were close, there were fatal flaws that actually made it more obvious that they were to be excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2045)|
| 0:34:20| And just like Joe, get a copy eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| We can read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| It would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| What we came down to, and you can see on the top of that list, are five sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Main Street, State Street, the Coliseum site, Southern Station, and Church Avenue Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2072)|
| 0:34:41| And we'll go through these pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| And what you'll see here is you'll see a site location map, some general pros and cons, and then the concept that was developed for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2083)|
| 0:34:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| So the Main Street site is located next to, well, where it is now, in front of the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| Pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| It's the closest to the downtown governmental employment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| We included in there an accessible path to the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| Parking available, developed parking, which would help relieve the parking problem in the CCB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| It was the least expensive option both operationally and capital wise, construction wise, for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| The cons on this, though, were that it's limited in the number of bus berths that you can develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| Fourteen maximum with no chance of expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| And operationally, it's a dangerous issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| And I think we've got some photos here to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| But here's the concept plan that shows a waiting area and customer service at the northwest corner of the block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2143)|
| 0:35:54| and the city county block with offices in the back and enhancement of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| And these are just some pictures that were recently taken showing you some of the potential conflicts that are happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| about people walking between buses and out across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| It's an opportunity for a serious accident to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| And it's just a wonder it hadn't happened to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| The next site is the State Street site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| And, of course, that is the site that we left to look at this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| It is a fallback position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Right now, it had a connection to Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| It provided 20 bus berths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| It had good street visibility and access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| And it had a single platform for operational and safety efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| Some of the cons were that it was the most expensive site that we have, both operationally and from a capital standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2205)|
| 0:36:54| And also the land agreement with the county still presents some issues that could result in potential additional costs to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2214)|
| 0:37:04| over and above what we already have planned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| Depending on the way FTA rules on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| And we've had some opinions from transit attorneys that FTA would not accept that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2231)|
| 0:37:20| And then here's the concept for the State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| The next site we're looking at is the Coliseum site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| This site did not survive long, and I'll show you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| On the pros, the only pro it actually had was that the city owned the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| It could only accommodate 16 bus berths in a circular pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| which meant that patrons have to cross the bus driveway in order to make transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2262)|
| 0:37:51| The streets around there are very steep and very difficult to access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| And it's the furthest distance from the downtown core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| which meant that you'd have to increase trolley service, which is an increase in operational costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| And then there was also identified as possible conflicts with events that go on the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| And the concept, again, is it puts 16 buses on there, but it doesn't work and it's an operational nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2290)|
| 0:38:20| So that one didn't even get costed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| It got kicked out because of the operational issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| The next one is the Southern Station, Southern Depot Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| The pros, it's proximity to future rail, good street access, and it can accommodate the 20 bus berths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| The negatives on it are it results in a split level platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| You would have half of the buses up on depot and the other half down at the level of the station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| So there are operational issues there, plus you've got half your buses on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| In addition, the railroad was not willing to give us any kind of long-term lease on the access to the property from the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2338)|
| 0:39:12| FTA requires that we demonstrate control of the property with either own the property or a minimum 50-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2352)|
| 0:39:21| The railroad was not willing to sell the property, but they were willing to give us a 30-day lease with a 30-day termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2361)|
| 0:39:32| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| A lease for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| That you could renew every 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| And that has a serious impact because the key to that site is access from the west side from depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2382)|
| 0:39:52| And that's what is owned by the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| Distance from the downtown core would require additional trolley service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| It would require displacement of seven businesses with approximately 50 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| It was the second most costly option, both operational and capital wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| There are impacts to the historic building, which we haven't even begun to address because they're going to be very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2413)|
| 0:40:23| And then the impacts to the neighboring businesses because of the additional traffic or new traffic, bus traffic on depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2423)|
| 0:40:32| And here's the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| And, again, you can see that half of the buses are actually on depot in a very similar arrangement to what we have out on main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| And the rest of them are 10 to 12 feet below that on the station level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| The last site we have is the preferred site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| It's Church Avenue site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| And there's the location map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| The pros, it utilizes air rights over the parkway, helps establish a link between downtown core and the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| It's the second best cost option, second to the main street site from capital and operational cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| Good visibility from major streets, close proximity to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| It provides the full 20 bus berths, and it utilizes the single platform, which is for operational efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2473)|
| 0:41:22| And it uses existing parking, which is across the street at the Coliseum parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| The cons are it requires displacement of one business with approximately 35 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| and also it requires an extended lease agreement with TDOT for the air rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| Based on those five sites, a final tally was done, and this was, again, from the project team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2503)|
| 0:41:53| evaluating the sites according to these broad categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| And the Church Avenue bridge was the clear winner with the State Street Project second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2518)|
| 0:42:07| So based on that, we developed the recommendations looking at going back to the purposes and needs that Don and Michelle talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2527)|
| 0:42:18| Did we satisfy those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| So I think that's the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| And so, and you can go through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| But basically, that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| We satisfied those goals and needs better than any other site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| This one did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2549)|
| 0:42:44| Go back to the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| Yeah, it's not showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| It may show up on the back one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2570)|
| 0:42:58| It's forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Page 40 of your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| And this is the master plan for the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| And what this shows you is the extent of the work area, which would be all the way from or to Gay Street on the west end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2585)|
| 0:43:15| and Hall of Fame on the east end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| The facility would be located on the north side of the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| and actually be attached to the bridge with a plaza, possibly a planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2602)|
| 0:43:31| Again, the CAT facilities, it's about 18,000 square feet of building space and the accommodation of the bus berths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2611)|
| 0:43:42| And it is a covered, the busway is covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| It's not air conditioned, but it does provide shelters underneath the cover to get out of the wind and rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2626)|
| 0:43:54| Jeff, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| It's actually on the next page, but, well, it's on this chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| What's the difference between constructability and construction cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| Well, constructability is how difficult is it to construct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| For instance, on the unrelated to construction cost or, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| It does have a relationship, but the real issue there is like on depot, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2655)|
| 0:44:23| we would have to put a retaining wall at depot in order to make enough room on the lower level for the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2663)|
| 0:44:32| So how do you construct that wall without depot falling in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| So it's the difficulty of construction, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| The last slide we have is our next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| And to give you an idea of where we were, the land appraisal is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| Mr. Zena gave us permission to get on site to do the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| And the appraiser is working on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| We hope to have something by the first of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| Once we get that appraisal, then we have to go to another appraiser for a review appraiser to validate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2709)|
| 0:45:17| And then the FTA requires that before the city can ever even begin to make an offer on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2717)|
| 0:45:25| So that we believe we're going to get done fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| The environmental assessment is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| This is a very key part of the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| And it's on our critical path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| And part of that is that we have to get a phase one environmental conducted on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| We have survey and subsurface investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| We do not presently have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| You said just phase one or phase one and phase two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Because phase one does not require the subsurface, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| No, those were three different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| But you just said phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| But then you talked about subsurface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| Phase one environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| The EA says we've got to do a phase one environmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| And as another part of that, we do subsurface investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| And as another part, we've got to do a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| You're talking about going beyond phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| And now in phase one, if something is discovered in phase one, then we've got to do a phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| So just on the environmental part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| So we don't have access to that, to the site, in order to complete that portion of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2786)|
| 0:46:35| Without that, we're delayed day for day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| Now, the impact of that right now is in normal circumstances, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| we spend a lot of time on this project doing the work and getting some work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| We've got a little bit of a sense of urgency here because right now the James White Parkway is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| And what we're anticipating is that if we can get a finding of no significant impact through the EA process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2819)|
| 0:47:07| that possibly we can get our foundations done before the parkway reopens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| That's going to save a lot of money and a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| So it's an opportunity that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| And every day we delay diminishes that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| So that's the environmental assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Preliminary engineering is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| We continue to develop the site and look at all of the options and potential, again, faults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2852)|
| 0:47:41| If something comes up that we don't see, for instance, this site is still not a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| We still have a lot of research to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| And you never know when that could come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| So we're progressing as fast as we can, but we are stymied on part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| Our schedule, again, we want to try to start foundations around July, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| But that is absolutely dependent on getting the environmental assessment complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| And we're held up on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| That's our information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| So I'll turn it back over to Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| Thanks, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| And I appreciate everybody's getting through this as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| I appreciate Council's patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| And I guess this is a time for any questions, or I'm sure you'll want to hear from some folks, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| So I'll open it up to questions and get the right person up here to answer the question or answer it myself, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I'll try to be as quick as I can with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| First of all, I want to say I appreciate all the work you've done, and I know it's been a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| And I personally want to comment on a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| And one is the issue of displacing a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| And then I'd like to also just speak about rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| I really don't have a problem with this location except for the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| this council and this administration goes way out of their way to recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| and enhance business development in the city and in our downtown, which has been a major priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| And yet we have one here that is a thriving business, taxpaying, contributing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| and we're going to displace them, potentially even run them out of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| And I really wanted to know, having said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| just really how have we handled this in terms of trying to relocate this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| and working with them in terms of because I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| eminent domain is a sensitive enough topic that we ought to really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| walk them by their hand around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| And, you know, we have a lot of areas that seems to me that would be suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| And so I just, if you could, just sort of walk me through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| Sure, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| We're very concerned about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| This is a thriving business, a valuable business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| You know, it doesn't have a retail presence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| It's got a visibility presence that's important to the business that we are aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| We are somewhat limited, obviously, by the FTA process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| and by what the appraisal is to give fair market value for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| On top of that, Mayor Haslam has met with Mr. Zien on a couple of occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| and I know Jeff has as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| We would do, will do, and pledge to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| We do not want this business to leave town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| We find that we would do anything we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| We've gotten some ideas of the kind of locations and presence that the business wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| They want to be close to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| They want to have some parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| They want to have a building kind of presence somewhat like they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| and therefore they don't want to be in an office building, you know, on Gay Street or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| We're more than willing and, in fact, have already taken some preliminary looks around also to see if it's a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| The city has some capacity through some other programs we've taken to you before, you know, to provide assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| There's some relocation assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| We'll do everything we can within the law of what one can pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| but we have to start, of course, with the appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| and we're very appreciative that the owner has let the appraiser on the property to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| But our intention is not to be the least bit dismissive, cavalier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| or understate in any way the fact that a thriving business is important and we want the business to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| Who primarily interfaces with American Accessories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| Who has so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Well, so far we've had Jeff to begin with, and really we would generally go through PBA as part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3104)|
| 0:51:53| You know, I've had a couple of conversations with a few folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Mayor Haslam has, but we will work with PBA, and we'll work directly with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| I just hope we as a city really take this seriously and, you know, and carry with this as a sensitive matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| and I hope it can be worked out, and I look forward to seeing what comes of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| We have every intention of working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| I can assure you that the mayor has already had two or three conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Let me ask you, what other at what point or what considerations were given for other locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| with eminent domain considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| In other words, did we ever say that would be a good site, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| and we can take that business or that would be a good site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| or did we just really sort of rule out, you know, taking businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| except for the fact that this rolled out into this particular business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| Well, I think when you recall the general map, when you're talking about something of this scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| even the State Street site involved a property that was owned by somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| They became aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| Our assumption is never that it gets to eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| That's never what we want to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| We want to get to where we work with the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| We realize they don't, and we've made clear, and I'm sure you'll hear, they don't want to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| This is a disruption to them that we don't understate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| But the idea is to try to give them a fair price to relocate in a good facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| and continue to work in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| So we never go into it thinking the city can take this or take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| The consideration was minimizing the number of businesses affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| That was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| Frankly, it's pretty hard unless you have Main Street and Coliseum were purely city-owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| Unfortunately, one thing Jeff didn't get out of is during this we had a lot of feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| We had a phenomenal amount of feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Hundreds of people signing petitions not to go with Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Phenomenal amount there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| So, you know, it is a factor and an important factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| but it's one we hoped we could not get to the eminent domain stage in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Just real quickly, Gretchen, I believe is your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| you mentioned earlier that when looking at rail locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| could you just kind of give me a few of the areas that you looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| You know, you said, I believe you said that you looked at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| all the possibilities for rail locations, and I'm just wondering, you know, what were some of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| I'm going to introduce my colleague, Wendy Riggs-Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| who has actually been involved with this project for a couple more years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| and most of the sighting studies that were part of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| We first worked on the project in the 2003 sighting study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| that was in support of what was then the 500 Gay Street block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| And at that time, you know, rail has always been a concern and consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| as it always is with a multimodal interest in transit and transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| In the studies for 2003, we were working with a program for 22 bus bays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3290)|
| 0:54:57| and we looked at, I think, 23 sites in that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| And at that time, the Jackson, it's Jackson Street site, was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| In that period of studies, we were not going beyond the boundaries of what are the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| over the tracks or across the parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| because we were very concentrated on a walking distance to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| So we looked at the Jackson Street site, one to the west of Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| and we also looked at a site to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| And what you find on those two sites is that they are extremely challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| both by width and by grade change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| And we're talking about large buses who have tremendous turning radiuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| clearance issues, and operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| Every time a bus has to brake or accelerate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| we are wearing down their longevity and the cost to maintain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| So the Jackson Street site was identified as having a fatal flaw in that study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| because it is, one, too narrow to accommodate the number of buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| or the circulation that's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| and two, the grades are too steep to access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| Ideally, if you could get into it from Gay Street or from Henley, you'd be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| But because you have to go down the grade on Jackson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| it really challenges bus operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| And then the sites are too narrow for the kind of center-loaded bus space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| And also, those sites had and continue to have existing businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| that would require access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Yeah, I'm just really wondering what areas were looked at and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| Then in the second study, the sites actually on the south side of Jackson were looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3405)|
| 0:56:52| thinking that that might give us an opportunity to get close to rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| At that time, again, we're challenged by grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| And then in this last siting study, the depot site was brought in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| because, as Don Michelle indicated, we determined, okay, let's go a little further out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| because we're having so much trouble finding a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| And with the depot site, as Jeff showed you, the pros and cons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| again, the grades significantly challenged the site for bus operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| and two, the narrowness of the site in that case forced half of the bus space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| You know, we could solve that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| But it forced half of the bus space up onto depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| and then we're back to curbside boarding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| which is a negative for the kind of safe, efficient bus operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| that this project is striving to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Is that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| And I can get with you all later and talk about it a little bit more if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| But I just want to say this, that, you know, if you look at one aspect of rail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| or you hear various reasons where rail would come or go, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| if you look at them one by one, you know, I don't think it really makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| But when you look at all the, you know, the potential and the possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| and the change in Norfolk Southern's legal opinion on using freight lines for passenger rail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3496)|
| 0:58:23| and that rail will be to the Tennessee line in Bristol soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| and, you know, lines are already moving out of Nashville to Lebanon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| and, you know, we're in a non-attainment situation here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| And, you know, we discussed this in the James White Parkway process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| And, you know, just all around us, rail has been an asset to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| And if you look at older, bigger cities, more populated cities, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| obviously they all go to rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| And so I think we ought to at least try to put ourselves in a position to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| to accept it when the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| And I think it's coming sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| But having said that, I, you know, again appreciate all the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| and I'll continue to follow the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| First question about the State Street site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| Except for the southeast corner where the utility station is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| is that entire parcel county owned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| I mean, is there, has the county been asked to waive air rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| I believe the mayor's had a conversation and that's not, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| they're not going to waive the air rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| I didn't know if there was some way, if it got shifted to the east, the actual facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3573)|
| 0:59:42| if there was some way that, you know, have it border on central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| if there was some way that we could find a way to make it work down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| I think we want to explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| I believe they looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Yeah, we did look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| And there's not enough room on the east portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| because of the KUB substation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| The bus bay goes from Union to Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| So it needs the whole length of that block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| It's referenced in here there are two property owners you'd have to secure air rights from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| Who are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| One is over the parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| I think it's owned by KUB, the Promenade Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| And the other is at Gay Street, Dewhurst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| and several other partners that purchased that property there at Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| I have a second on the southern railway station site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| Isn't the station on the National Register of Historic Places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Well, then, don't you have a Section 109 review to go through before you start tinkering with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| if you're expending federal funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| I think it's Section 106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Three off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| And absolutely we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| And we've been through that on both the Gay Street site and the State Street site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| So we're very familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| And you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| It would definitely come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| So, I mean, it's not like there could be wholesale tinkering with the railway station there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Now, for the southern site, there's also a willing seller, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3679)|
| 1:01:28| Actually, we did not get that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Who's the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| I believe it's Sam Furr Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| I think in lunch with Mayor Haslam, he told me it was a willing seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| Now, okay, for the church, I mean, everything has gotten shifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| The pictures and everything has gotten shifted pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| And things are small and can't fully grasp everything right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| But I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Are you talking about building floating a second bridge across James White Parkway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| Essentially, that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| It's to the north of the existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| And that's the second lowest construction cost to all these other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| I mean, I don't build for a living, but it seems like putting a bridge over, I mean, a pretty lengthy area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3734)|
| 1:02:24| and it's got to be wide enough to accommodate turnarounds for buses seems to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3744)|
| 1:02:31| Johnson & Galleon is our construction manager on this project, and they provided the estimates on all the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3751)|
| 1:02:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| You know, I mean, I guess at this point, my concern is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| I was talking with Charles Swanson earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Eminent domain is one thing when it's abandoned, neglected, back on taxes, and totally not utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3771)|
| 1:03:00| My concern is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Part what Councilman Bailey said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| We have a business that's presently there paying its taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| Its building looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| And it's not a drag on anything, if you ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| That's my concern, you know, with the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| And it's an unwilling seller versus, you know, a willing seller that we can –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| that admittedly the southern side has its separate issues that it might eventually someday get tied in to rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| But I'm having, you know, difficulty at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| I mean, each situation where you have to look at eminent domain is a unique situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| and it's got to weigh heavily on your mind about what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| And I'm just struggling with it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Let me add in response to that that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| I think what you described as the use of eminent domain is generally in the redevelopment context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| and I agree with you 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| But in the public infrastructure contest of, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| just the number of businesses either for Hall of Fame or for the I-40 extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| I mean, this is a – and hopefully, I don't know how many of these used eminent domain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| or how many were negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| But we're talking about public transportation infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| where you hate to have to, you know, take any – to involve in an unwilling transfer of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| but I think it is a different use and a different model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| and different concept than for removal of blight with eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| While I agree with that, the result is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| And it's the ultimate person that's losing their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| no matter if you get to it through going one way or going through the other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| to the property owner, it's still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| Well, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| I have a couple of follow-up questions to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| One is a follow-up to Councilman Bailey's question about eventual rail connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| And I want to make sure that I took notes correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| When Ms. Von Grossman was speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| did I hear you say that the lifespan of this facility is estimated to be 15 to 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| In particular, as the sole transit facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| you would expect that this facility could continue in operation after that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| but it's likely to be augmented by additional facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| to take care of what we anticipate to be growth in the transit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| whether it's more buses or the addition of bus rapid transit or rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| Can we elaborate on that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| Maybe I'm getting old, but 15 to 20 years seems like a really short amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| especially considering the investment of funds, particularly federal funds, in this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3932)|
| 1:05:40| Are we not thinking long-term enough in terms of the number of bus bays that we're willing to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| What's shortening this time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Well, I apologize if I was unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| I'm not saying that the facility would close after 15 or 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| but rather that it would no longer be central to the system because the system will grow, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| We hope that this facility will be the stepping stone to allow the system to grow and reach new needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| The city of Knoxville will grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| There will be additional development in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| The center of need for transportation will geographically shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| and there will be need for an additional facility that will be more state-of-the-art than this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| If you look at other transit systems across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| especially in smaller cities that are starting from a bus transit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3988)|
| 1:06:36| that's a pretty consistent trend that it takes a 15- or 20-year window for them to move into the next phase of their service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| and have new needs that need to be filled by new facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4004)|
| 1:06:51| I understand your laddering concept that you have to achieve success at a more basic level, and then you move up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| But given that, if this center is as successful as we hope it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| and we move up the ladder of transportation success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| you're still saying that this location or this center is going to be obsolete in 15 or 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| and I'm having trouble wrapping my arms around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| Can I offer a historic example in another town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Columbus, Ohio. COTA runs a service there. It's very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| They built a downtown transfer center not dissimilar to what's being proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| In the heart of their downtown, it is on the street level of a parking structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| It's been in place for 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| They have, a mile down the road, an on-street transfer center that services another eight routes that transfer through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4063)|
| 1:07:54| And they began a process five years ago to construct, to develop a new transfer center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4074)|
| 1:08:03| not saying that they're walking away from the ones that they have in the downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| but in response to the evolution of how their downtown's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| The existing transfer center's in the heart of downtown, out to one, and is nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4093)|
| 1:08:20| which is a large, it's like the TVA here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| I'm from Columbus, Ohio, so I'm very familiar with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| Then you probably have these images in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| Around the nationwide employment center, it's only a block and a half from what was recently developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| and over the last ten years is a new convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| The new arena has been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| And these sites are within walking distance of the existing rail, where Amtrak has service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4122)|
| 1:08:50| And Ohio is a state where their vision for rail is moving forward much more rapidly than some of the other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4130)|
| 1:09:00| There's a real investment and belief in the three-seat service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| which is a connection from tying Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus together on rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| And so they are now in a position to, one, they need more bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4150)|
| 1:09:17| They are looking to connect their city bus service with intercity bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4157)|
| 1:09:24| And they see that light rail and or commuter rail is actually going to happen in the very near future there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| So as they're expanding and accommodating the growth of their bus needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| they're also responding to what is going to become a rail service in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| And they're linking to a new employment center, which they didn't have when the downtown center was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| So it's just acknowledging that downtown areas develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| They grow. They change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| Employment centers change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| And as ridership increases, then there's the demand for light rail, and the investment can be supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| And there's the demand, light rail or commuter rail or bus rapid transit, and that it evolves over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4209)|
| 1:10:17| And as ridership grows, the facilities you need evolve over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| My vision here in Knoxville would be that at the time that rail comes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| the bus transfer that would want to be part of that multimodal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| isn't 20 bus bays that are providing transfer for the route service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| but select bus service that would feed through that multimodal with an appropriate number of buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| and appropriate amount of passenger service with rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| I don't believe that would be the 20 bus bays that are required on a site for transfer now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| I believe that would be a rail platform, a bus transfer that's for six buses perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4258)|
| 1:11:07| But to plan for that connection now, I think it would be a different animal at the time we're planning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4267)|
| 1:11:15| Does that help at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| Yeah, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| I guess I'm still wondering if the transfer center is built where there's connectivity to light rail now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4279)|
| 1:11:28| then aren't you in a better position going forward in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| I guess that's what I'm struggling with in terms of this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| This facility having a long life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| I think what I heard you say is this facility would not close down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| You're saying it would link with a future facility if the transit needs continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| and this region continues to grow in the way that other cities have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| I think your assumption is correct in that if we could identify a site where this bus transfer center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| could operate successfully adjacent to the rail, that it would make sense to do that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| But we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| We have not been able to identify that site yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| I have another question, and that is if you could go to either slide 36 or slide 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| and those are the concept drawings for the preferred site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4339)|
| 1:12:26| And because our copies have very small print, kind of difficult to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| could someone walk us through how this is actually going to operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| I mean, show me a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Do you have a laser or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Show me a bus coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Show me a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| How this circulates, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| We don't have a laser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| You need to be on the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| Bring one of those mics over if you want to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| It's amazing for all the technology we have why we can't do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| We've got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| We've got a wireless mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| We can hand it around if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| I guess we should have left those up to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| Is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Did you check it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| This is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4395)|
| 1:13:22| Is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Summit Hill is up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| We have Hall of Fame Drive here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| This is the Church Avenue Bridge, Central, State, and Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4410)|
| 1:13:37| A busway to support 20 buses with center platform transfer has to be 710 feet by 140 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4417)|
| 1:13:49| and that's why we're challenged for a block downtown to accommodate a program like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| Church Avenue Bridge is being reconstructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| The vision is that the existing sidewalk would be expanded by a pedestrian plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4437)|
| 1:14:05| that would provide improved linkage from Gay Street all the way across to the Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4445)|
| 1:14:12| in support of that Crandall-Arambula vision that Mike spoke to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| And then so that's essentially a bridge adjacent to the existing bridge on the same 4% slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4457)|
| 1:14:24| that is out there now or is being reconstructed as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| And then here's our busway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| It is essentially would be envisioned as a slab or a bridge on a slightly different slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4470)|
| 1:14:39| and independent from this structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| And primary entrance to it, in the morning, buses come from Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| They will come right down Hall of Fame, enter this busway, circulate around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| Boarding is on the right-hand side of buses, so what you're seeing here are 20 sawtooth bays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| Pedestrians coming to get on their buses or off would enter from Church Ave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4499)|
| 1:15:06| into a building at the same elevation as the bridge, which at this point is a full story below the busway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4506)|
| 1:15:17| So people can walk down the street, enter the building through a large open waiting area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| That's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4524)|
| 1:15:40| We need to get this on record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| You'll have to use one of the other microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4543)|
| 1:15:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I think you lost me when I was talking about the pedestrian access is across Church or Hall of Fame from the Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4555)|
| 1:16:04| but you're on Church Avenue on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| And we have a large open entryway that takes you into an interior waiting area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4566)|
| 1:16:16| it has customer service, it has security, it has toilet rooms, to escalators, elevators, and stairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| that take you up to the center platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| The center platform allows people to get on any bus or to arrive on a bus and transfer to another bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| without being required to cross the busway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| In our experience, that's a very important feature, and it has been high on our list of criteria to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4595)|
| 1:16:42| We need a site large enough that allows us to provide a safe, efficient operations for CAT and for the ridership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4602)|
| 1:16:53| Also, the buses are entering, circulating, and then exiting out to Church Ave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| We're providing two points of entry and egress to allow for the most efficient operations for CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4619)|
| 1:17:07| and the most effective flow, continued flow of traffic on the city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| You said two points of entrance and egress. I didn't catch well. I just caught one of each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4632)|
| 1:17:20| Yes. Well, both of these paths, from Hall of Fame and from Church Ave, would allow for entry and egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| Hall of Fame is challenged by its grades, so in some cases, exiting would be more effective on Church Ave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| How big did you say the bus platform was going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| A busway to accommodate 20 bus vehicles and a center platform is roughly 140 feet by 710 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4658)|
| 1:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| That's to accommodate all the bus operating clearances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| So what does this look like if I'm a pedestrian walking along the Gay Street Bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| It seems like, from what you said, this is at least a two-story building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| because when I walk in, I'm on a reception floor, but the buses are actually above my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| I mean, the level where you get on the buses is upstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| We didn't honestly come here to present the design, and that's just in the beginning of preliminary engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4691)|
| 1:18:21| But I'll try to describe to you the two forms that this creates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4701)|
| 1:18:29| The Church Ave. Bridge is at a high point here with a 4% slope coming across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| So where we are at, like, 884 here, at the entrance, the roadway's at 872.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4715)|
| 1:18:46| So right there is, okay, do the math for me, what, a 14-foot difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| The busway is challenged by roadway clearances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| We need a minimum of 23 feet clear from any of the streets below to the finished floor of the slab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4736)|
| 1:19:06| And there's a ramp that comes down here that's a high point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| That's the control point for the busway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| So at this point, we need to be at 888 for the busway, and the sidewalk is at, like, 880.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| So here where the road and the busway are level, same elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| at this point, the busway is now 8 feet higher than the bridge and the plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| And at this point over here, it's grown to the point where the busway is roughly 18 feet above the plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| So we start to have this elevation split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| This is sloping down, and the busway's sloping down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| They're flush here, and then you have this space developing, this vertical gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| And there's a lot of discussion and design work being done about what this plaza looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| how that vertical gap is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Is it a solid wall? Is it a screen wall? Is it a moving wall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| And the relationships, you know, to the other elements on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| We've looked at two-story schemes for the program, which is approximately 18,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| We're also looking at single-story schemes where the building and the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| and the cat facilities have a lot of presence on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| but a large portion of the construction for efficiency happens actually under the busway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| So we're also spending a lot of time exploring opportunities to bring in as much natural light to the lower level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| and also to give this large busway a signature presence in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| about this is where entry is, this is where circulation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| But we don't have a lot of building. We've got a lot of busway here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| And it's also intended that for those who aren't waiting in the waiting room on the lower level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4852)|
| 1:20:59| but those who are making transfers or waiting for their buses on the busway level itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| that there be canopies and some wind shelters at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| So you start having several elements that take on form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| And while it's considered a bridge and a plaza and a building and a busway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| we're really working hard now for that to become a composite of a transit center for downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4878)|
| 1:21:26| And where is the slide that showed, I don't know whether it was from Crandall or Ambula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| it showed what the Church Street...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| Crandall or Ambula's vision from the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| Showing the connectivity from the main part of downtown over to the Coliseum area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| This section here, really looking for the kind of pedestrian promenade of how you have wider sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4903)|
| 1:21:53| how pedestrians are protected from travel, how there is a sequence of greenery and waiting spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4913)|
| 1:22:03| and signage and activity to strengthen what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| When we had our first meeting with the MPO, they said, you know, bridge the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| The parkways become a slice through Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| Let's make this an opportunity to bridge the gap for people who are using the Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| and using the garages and will be using the transit facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| Before I go to Councilman Holquist, who is next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| is it possible for somebody, while we realize that it may change, may look different down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| to put some sort of computer generator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| a conceptual kind of rendering of what this could possibly look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| We should have brought our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| I mean, it could be an image board or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Realizing that obviously that's flexible, but it can give some height and depth to what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| That's kind of where I think Councilman Roddy was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| One thing we're trying to do now is to make sure that the elevations work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| that we've got the proper structural spacing in the James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| So what we're trying to flush out right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| the technical issues about making sure that we can even do what we're planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| Again, we've got a long way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| and there's always a potential for a fatal flaw to come up even on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| We've got a lot of investigation to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| Does that stop you from doing an image board or a concept of what it's going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| while you're working out measurements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| I mean, a picture is just a drawing, and a picture is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| It's getting ahead of the game, because we don't know exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| It'll help us to visualize the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| May I please elaborate on the response I gave to Councilor Roddy earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| Councilor Roddy, you had asked if it was a good idea to locate this transfer facility near rail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5038)|
| 1:24:06| if there was the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| And I'd like to elaborate on my response a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| I think if we had found that opportunity, we would have had to have looked at it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| But I'll go back to something my colleague, Wendy Riggs-Smith, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| is it may not be appropriate to have a 20-bus transfer facility co-located near rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5060)|
| 1:24:28| It's not clear that all 20 routes in the CAT system really need to have that immediate access to rail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5068)|
| 1:24:36| and that would greatly constrain, I think, the ability to create the best rail station possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5076)|
| 1:24:46| Really, this facility is about creating bus-to-bus transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| Bus-to-rail transfer is a separate design issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| I hope that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| You might as well not sit down yet because I want to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| I appreciate Councilman Roddy's questions as well as my other colleagues' questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| I think those are good questions in addressing a lot of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| In response, Ms. Von Gossman, in response to your statement that you just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| have you been to Salt Lake City and seen their facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| And you're aware then that that is a truly intermodal or multimodal facility by design and intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| and it's designed to be phased and expanded over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| You know that it is adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| Rather than being in the core of downtown, it is adjacent to the Union Pacific or UP tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| so that it can access both Amtrak, which is a present existing service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| and commuter rail, which is a service that's not yet existing but is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| But it's imminent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| It is imminent to go to Ogden first and then eventually to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| You know that it contains all their bus transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| I'm not saying there aren't in route transfer facilities or super stops or something like that anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| There may be some of those, but it is essentially their main central transfer facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| And they also were able to co-locate Greyhound away from their original facility on Temple Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5172)|
| 1:26:21| into that new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| Do you think there's a reason that they did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| I know John English, by the way, the GM for Utah Transit, and I've talked to him quite a bit about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| but I'd like to get your take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| I know what his is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| I'm sure there's a reason they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| I'm sure it will work very well for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| I know the site is, as you said, on the edge of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| and they were able to find sufficient space to locate all those program elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| in a way that they could operate together successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| and that that will allow for the success of the facility moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| And it connects into the heart of downtown not only by bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| but by what will be an extension of the TRAX light rail system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| which currently terminates at the, I don't know what they call it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| still the Jazz Terminal or whatever, the professional basketball terminal there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| and to Temple Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| One of the key aspects of that site was that it's relatively flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| and there are very good city streets leading to several sides of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5251)|
| 1:27:40| and that allowed for very good access by multiple vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| and the combination of all those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| Well, I've been there a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| I know there's a street on the front side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| There's railroad tracks on the back side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| and the ends are pretty much boxed in to a certain degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5274)|
| 1:28:02| Would you agree, and I think I did hear you say this to Councilman Rowdy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| that all other things being equal, and I don't want to put words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| so you'll have to tell me if this is indeed your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| all other things being equal, it makes sense to have a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| that can truly be multimodal, A and B is expandable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| rather than having to create multiple facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5301)|
| 1:28:28| Yes, I think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| I have to say, though, that there aren't multiple modes today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| and there are not multiple modes in the recognizable term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5316)|
| 1:28:42| say a five-year term, perhaps beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| We're really only focused on bus transfer at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| I have a question for Doug Burton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| Perhaps more than one, but certainly one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5336)|
| 1:29:06| Thanks for hanging around, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| You went with a group of people from CAT, KTA, and others, I think, from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| to look at the Orlando facility, their transit facility, did you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| The Orlando facility, and again, I have not been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| I've only seen photographs of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| and I think you may have even shown me a photograph or two yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| Correct me if I'm wrong in anything I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| I trust that you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| The Orlando facility is located next to rail lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| but they don't have any current plans to institute rail transit or passenger rail service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| And that is planning for the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| I would say they're planning for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| I don't know if that was just the luck of the draw of that piece of parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| or if they specifically sought out a piece of parcel that had rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| Did they not indicate when you all went that that was part of their vision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| They did say that it was fortunate that they had rail on that site, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| So they seem to have thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| You and I have had these conversations before about how you start with bus service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| and you progress, as you indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| and you try to establish routes first with bus service, if you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| and then you progress on to bus rapid transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| And, of course, we know bus rapid transit, or BRT for short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| the purest form of that has its own right-of-way and essentially its own lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5437)|
| 1:30:45| its own facilities that are not shared by general traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| So it becomes similar to rail if it's in the purest form of BRT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5449)|
| 1:30:58| And I understand, again, you and I have had these discussions in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| It does make sense when you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| But my impression is that many times when rail systems go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| they are not always replacing an identical route bus system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| And I guess I would ask you if you're aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| with Nashville's new commuter rail system, Music City something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5477)|
| 1:31:24| I can't remember, Music City something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| that runs from Lebanon, Tennessee into downtown Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| are you aware of a bus service provided by Nashville's transit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5491)|
| 1:31:39| I believe it's the MTA, from Lebanon to downtown Nashville on that route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5499)|
| 1:31:46| that that actually displaced that proved the route before that was put in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| I can't say for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| I know that downtown Nashville has way many more employees than Knoxville does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5511)|
| 1:31:58| Their parking, we had some people from Nashville here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| they said, boy, if I could park it at the rates you all have at $50 or $60, that would be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| That's not my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| My question is not number of employees or parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| There's a series of express routes that bring people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| And that train only runs three times in the morning and three times in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| It's a typical commuter rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| I'm just trying to get a feel for retalking apples and apples here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| And you're trying to give me some feedback on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| I know they have tons of express routes that take employees throughout the region into downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| Whether a route went straight, you know, a bus route went straight down the way the train went, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| But I imagine they're collecting those type of commuters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| Yeah, I'm just looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| I wouldn't expect it to follow the exact same route because it would probably follow the interstate, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| or one of the older highways that runs there rather than immediately adjacent to the rail line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| But I'm just – in seeing rail systems, both commuter rail and light rail systems in a lot of other cities in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5574)|
| 1:33:01| I guess I often look at systems I think there's no way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| especially those that use existing rail lines for a portion of their line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| whether it's San Diego or Salt Lake or any of the other cities that have done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| there's no way in some cases that they could have had bus service that would have really exactly duplicated that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| To some degree, they may or may not have provided service to the same areas, you know, from the full extent of those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5600)|
| 1:33:30| But I think in general, your point's well taken and it's very valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| I guess the only thing I'm saying is I'm not sure that that's a prerequisite for rail service in every case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5616)|
| 1:33:44| Well, we've talked to people at FTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| In order to get federal funds, they ask that you prove that you can have some level of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5626)|
| 1:33:52| And they look at more of a corridor to say if you're going to put light rail in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| you do computer model to say how many people can you draw into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| And the one thing they look at is what is your existing success for transit in that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| There are people who say, well, I'll never ride a bus, but I would ride light rail transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| And that's a given also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| But there are people who ride buses that would shift to that to go downtown or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| That definitely helps in terms of making your case to FTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| There's no doubt that there's a big value in selling the FTA if you're going through the New Starts program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| That's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| I have a question for Mr. Gallion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| If I can get back to the correct sheet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| Page 37 of the handout at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| I'm not sure if it's the same on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| Siting study preferred site recommendation by project team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| The grading sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| You were asked earlier about the constructability, about construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| You said construction costs were based on estimates provided to you by Johnson and Gallion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5701)|
| 1:35:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| And the constructability, how is that analysis done and what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| Again, it's a rough estimate of how difficult is the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| And it's from the architects and from the contractor making an opinion about an assessment of how difficult is the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5722)|
| 1:35:31| I assume that that assessment is fairly well documented though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| They did a narrative description or how did they provide you that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| It was discussed in one of our project meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| It's not in writing anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| I don't know that it's delineated completely in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| We have a ranking here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| But nobody ever bothered to write that down is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| We'll be happy to discuss the details with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| And, you know, if I knew you were going to do that, I would have had Johnson and Gallion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| But those are points of discussion based on professional opinions of the architects, the engineers, and the construction manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5768)|
| 1:36:17| And that's when it went into that assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| I trust you had some very interesting discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| What I'm asking you for is written documentation for construction costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| and written documentation on constructability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| Actual descriptions in writing so we can look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| and understand as we read through it what the comparative values are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| And I think this council deserves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| We'll be happy to provide that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| How soon can you provide it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| We've got the construction costs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| That's available immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| And we can reconvene and develop the constructability assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| Can you give me a timeline on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| Probably within the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| Within two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Well, I'm sure other council members will be interested in seeing that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| But I'll certainly be looking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| I have some more questions, but I think Councilman Becker has had his light on for a while, so we can come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| Councilman Becker, Councilman Frost was next, but you haven't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| I guess I started this meeting by saying I was grumpy, and I think I'm going to be grumpy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| I've got a question and a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| I guess my question is for Mr. Gallion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| We had the thing up here, and we were talking about the design of the Church Street Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5853)|
| 1:37:40| It's a bridge over the James White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| And then there's a level of, like, a pedestrian area, waiting areas, offices, and then the buses are on top of that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5866)|
| 1:37:58| So this is a – I mean, that's sort of the design we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| And this gets a little to Joe's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| And I still don't see how that's cheaper to build than what we have to do at the Southern Railway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| I mean, that does feel – and this is Rob's question earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| It seems like an extremely expensive thing to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| It sounds like to me a double-decker bridge, practically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| And I guess it goes a little bit to what Councilman Holquist says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| Do you feel good about the cost estimates you've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| We believe that Johnson & Gallion has, you know, been in the business long enough to give us a relatively sane estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5905)|
| 1:38:33| And it's broken down, and we'll be happy to provide that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| One of the factors is that the Southern station costs so much is having to renovate the existing facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5916)|
| 1:38:47| which has more square footage than is necessary for the program, in compliance with historical standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5927)|
| 1:38:55| That's a very expensive operation, and you've got to make it ADA accessible, and you've got to comply with those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| It costs a lot of money to do historical renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| That's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| I guess my sort of grumpy comment is we're going to be asked to make – well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| Maybe we're not actually asked to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| It almost seems like it would be nice if we're never going to be asked to make a decision about the future of transit in this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| and the future of a business, and it just feels like a lot right now – I mean, I have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| I want to yell at Bill Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| I mean, you know better than to give out something people can't read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| And I just – you know, it just – it's feeling like we're being asked to make a hard decision on a lot of numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5975)|
| 1:39:43| and decisions that – it doesn't feel good yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| I think we're on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| I mean, I think the church treats the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| I just – I don't feel like I'm getting what I need to make that decision with confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5991)|
| 1:39:59| And that's just my sort of grumpy comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| And I don't like these things either, just as a grumpy comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| Hey, Jeff, before you step down, before I go to Councilman Frost, you said you have cost estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| And you're going to do it for the Church Street site – I mean, yeah, for the Church Avenue Bridge site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6011)|
| 1:40:17| Let me ask you – well, first –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| All of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Let us see all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| That's what I was going to – all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| But in your recollection, was there a big difference between the cost of choice number one, recommendation number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6022)|
| 1:40:32| versus recommendation number two, three, and four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| Are we talking about tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| Vice Mayor Brown, as I recollect, the Main Street project, I think, was around $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6040)|
| 1:40:48| The Church Avenue Bridge was around $20.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| The Southern Station was $21 or $21.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6055)|
| 1:41:04| We did not price the Coliseum because it fell out before we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| What about State Street, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| State Street's about $23.5 to $24 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| And then on each one, you've got to factor in, additionally, land costs associated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6075)|
| 1:41:21| That's construction only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| That's construction only, not land costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| First, I gather Councilman Holquist wants to tie this to light rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| Safe assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Tie what to light rail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| The bus station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| I can explain it in greater detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| Those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| Now, I received, like the rest of the Council did a while back, a letter from First Presbyterian Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| that they did not like this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| I have not received a letter since that time saying we've changed our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| Is that letter going to be forthcoming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| The mayor met with the church, and they have assigned a representative of the church to work with our design team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6121)|
| 1:42:09| We have been in touch with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| Well, we've made phone calls, and we finally heard back to him, and we have a meeting set up for the first of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| Ben Garlington will be their design representative sitting on our design team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| Secondly, I have to give Charles Swanson credit for this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| Is there any possibility to moving this to the north if we're going to span James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6147)|
| 1:42:34| move it to the north so it could possibly tie in with the State Street parking garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| That way American Accessories wouldn't be displaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| Then you'd be running into the Cal Johnson, and that invokes another historic, it's called a 104 process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6166)|
| 1:42:53| when you take a park away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| And that's as serious, if not more so, than the 106 process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| I realize that, but under the Crandall-Arambula plan that you all passed out, Cal Johnson Rec Center is not there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6180)|
| 1:43:08| And that's the Crandall-Arambula plan, but when you're using federal dollars, you cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| I guess I'm loath to see a rec center go away, but is there any way that you could accommodate both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6194)|
| 1:43:25| You wouldn't have to pay American Accessories, I mean, for their land, for their building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6205)|
| 1:43:33| for the relocation costs if they stay put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| You could potentially integrate the rec center into this facility at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6217)|
| 1:43:44| I mean, when we're talking about putting the facility coupled with the movie theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| we were going to be having a daycare center and all of these things being integrated into the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6230)|
| 1:43:57| If that was possible then, why is it not possible now to consider putting the rec center in as an element of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6237)|
| 1:44:04| and keep American Accessories put and tied into the parking garage over at State Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6244)|
| 1:44:12| I can let Dawn Michelle Foster speak to the 104 process a little bit more if that will help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| I know that's a major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| Also, we don't have the link to the bridge itself to make the buses ingress and egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6261)|
| 1:44:31| So it's kind of out there, and I guess what you're saying is move it so far away from the bridge that there is no connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6271)|
| 1:44:38| Right, but you would enter on the east and west of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| I mean, right now you're going to be entering on the east of the bridge and you can depart on the south, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| instead of change the circulation pattern that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| Are you saying moving it up far enough past American Accessories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| Right, north towards, say, the Summit Hill Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| That general direction, I'm not saying right there at the Summit Hill Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| but in that way it would somehow tie into the State Street garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| Yes, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| During this environmental assessment, we go through thorough federal guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| Being a Section 4F, that Cal Johnson site is considered a park site, a recreational site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| and we have to go through extensive, thorough investigation on that site, even to relocate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| We don't think it would be supported by the public if we do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| We would, I guess, disassociate the community, the character there at that rec center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| And also, let me address Councilman Bailey on a question as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| as far as displacement and relocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| Being FTA is the lead agency, we have to follow federal guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| and offer a uniform relocation assistance act to property owners that we displace at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6356)|
| 1:46:03| That's another thorough investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| We do not recommend, and the federal government does not recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| that anyone be displaced or move out of a city based on something that they require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| They go through thorough negotiations with the city and the property owner for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6375)|
| 1:46:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| Before I go, I think I'm going to go to Councilwoman Pillow next, since she hadn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| But let me also say for the comments that Ms. Foster made, I wholly agree with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| And I would have grave concerns about bothering the Cal Johnson facility named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| after the first African-American millionaire in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| Also, I think at one time this council took action and did maybe an overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| or historic overlay or designation of all parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| And maybe even that park had been done also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| So we may have that whole situation to deal with that we've actually protected it in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| And I would have great problems and great difficulty in finding out how we can make it work with that particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| Just so I can go on the record for that, for someone who walks away and says Mark's in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| So let's make sure that Hayes knows Mark's not in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| Thank you, Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| Councilwoman Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| Well, Mark, I was just going to make very similar comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| because I believe that this council did go on record in regard to Cal Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| And I certainly do not want to be a party to anything that would, I think it would be a community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6446)|
| 1:47:33| And I think it is a community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| I think it's also a historic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| And I don't think this council wants to involve themselves in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| Some of the comments, too, in regard to that recommendation or that suggestion, that question, I don't know who's to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6461)|
| 1:47:51| But when you were doing your assessment of the locations, I know what in my mind is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6471)|
| 1:47:58| And right now what's in my mind isn't really important to anybody except me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| But it also weighs in on how you came to your conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| The walkability to the area, the ability for pedestrians to access this is, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6488)|
| 1:48:19| one of the most crucial elements of the decision on where we locate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| Now, I don't know if that in your minds, I see some heads nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| I don't know if that in your mind was one of the criteria that formed your matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6507)|
| 1:48:35| Does somebody just want to comment briefly on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| I think that is a major component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| And the comments we heard from the bus riders overwhelmingly, they want to be as close to the downtown area as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6520)|
| 1:48:49| And so that was an absolute major consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| Well, you know, that's been a major consideration of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| This conversation in regard to this transit center has been going on for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| It began when I first became an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| Extremely excited about the possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| Had been very disappointed that we cannot seem to come to any consensus regarding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6553)|
| 1:49:21| and a location that would serve everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| In the meantime, those people who elected us are the people who are suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| because we cannot come to that consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| And basically, you know, we're running out of time, some of us who have been around here about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| And frankly, I just really want us to really give some consideration to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| although it has nothing to do with the presentation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| But the walkability, the safe, the safe site is important to me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6589)|
| 1:49:56| Now, all of you all know that I spend a day a week downtown in one of the missions, working in one of the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6596)|
| 1:50:06| I have a very strong sense of where I think it is a wise thing to locate this in the center of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6606)|
| 1:50:18| for the people who are going to be using it, who are often people who are very challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| So I just, I guess that's one reason that the State Street site, losing that location, was a huge disappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6623)|
| 1:50:32| But, and just a huge disappointment, because that appeared to be just a winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6632)|
| 1:50:37| And I think we could have all, you know, agreed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| But, you know, given that, I just don't want us to lose sight of that criteria that we were looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6640)|
| 1:50:48| when the State Street site was so favored and so positive with the then council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6648)|
| 1:50:56| and I think probably with most of us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| So I just wanted to make those comments because the cost concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| I have a lot of confidence in Johnson Galleon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| I certainly have confidence in you and our administration not to lead us down a path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| which is going to be a shock and an embarrassment to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| And I know you know that we want you to keep that firmly in your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| But I do think it's getting to be time to be able to try to think of all the components of this, not just the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6683)|
| 1:51:32| I have to leave that to engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| But the components of this that are most important to me are those riders out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| who have not had this privilege and opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| And this is something that we have funds that are accessible to us at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| if we don't fiddle around too much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| So I just, I'm sorry that I was compelled to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| I was compelled to remind us of some of those criteria and some of those factors that we need to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| Joe, I've got a quick follow-up if I can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| I actually want to agree with Ms. Pelow on pretty much everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| and the frustration of how long this has taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| I don't understand why the Gay Street site fell out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| And I certainly, just to go on record, I don't understand why we gave up on State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| I look at these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| It's too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Well, it ain't much more expensive than anything else we've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| We've gone a lot further down the road and know a lot more about the cost of State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| I would not be surprised in eight months for somebody to come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| you know, the Church Avenue costs too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| We've got to look at another site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| And I'm just very frustrated about that and want to agree with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| And I don't know how to respond to that except to say that I think the inability to get an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6764)|
| 1:52:52| between the city and the county was one of the positive factors of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| perhaps being moved from the top of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| I guess I'll start with Mr. Galleon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| I have actually a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| In looking at the site or sites adjacent to Depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6799)|
| 1:53:27| did you consider as all or in part of a particular location the OS&M building materials site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6807)|
| 1:53:39| which is west of Gay Street, south of Depot, east of Broadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6819)|
| 1:53:45| Did you look at that site and evaluate it as either a stand-alone location or as part of a larger site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6825)|
| 1:53:52| I believe we did look at that as a stand-alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| It was not large enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| In conjunction with the southern station, it certainly would have been adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6836)|
| 1:54:02| But that site is separated from the southern by the piece that the railroad owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6842)|
| 1:54:10| Railroad owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| And they won't part with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Well, when you say that, I'm glad that's a good segue into another question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6853)|
| 1:54:18| You say that Norfolk Southern will not part with that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| Has a legal determination been made as to whether or not that little piece of property that separates the two we just described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6861)|
| 1:54:31| being the old southern station property and the old OS&M property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| is that considered under federal law to be necessary for the operation of the railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| or whatever the language is that gives them primacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| and makes them not subject to eminent domain or the city's authority therein?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6886)|
| 1:54:53| I'm certainly not qualified to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| Do you know if anyone investigated that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| I'm not aware of anybody doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| Well, it seems like a very important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| I know I had a conversation several months ago with Dan Taylor from KCDC about that very issue and that specific site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6904)|
| 1:55:12| And, of course, Dan's not an attorney either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| He's very experienced at property acquisition using redevelopment authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6914)|
| 1:55:19| And, of course, we know that that is part of the Jackson Avenue redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6919)|
| 1:55:24| It's already something that's under KCDC's jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| His opinion was that it probably was not essential to the operation of the railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| and, therefore, probably could be acquired by those methods or means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| Although, again, that is not a legal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| That is Dan Taylor's experienced professional opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| So it seems to me like that's a question that if it hasn't been answered, it should be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| And I'm not suggesting that we use that big club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| As more than one council member has pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| it's something we really don't want to do if we don't have to in any case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| But if it was a choice between acquiring a parcel that's marginal at best owned by Norfolk Southern Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6959)|
| 1:56:08| which is a big company who only has to operate their railroad and the other services related to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| versus acquiring a parcel that's going to displace a vibrant business, as has been pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| I think that's a question that we need to take a close look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| Also, I think the question of whether or not we've adequately plumbed the depths of negotiations with Norfolk Southern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6987)|
| 1:56:37| and looked at all the angles there I think is very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| because Norfolk Southern at different corporate levels is very different in terms of how you deal with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| and what their goals and objectives are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| The local operating people don't want to even talk to you, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| They just leave us alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| We're running a railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| The corporate level people have some slightly different objectives, some of the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| but they also have made some strong indications, including Mr. Rick Norman, the current CEO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7023)|
| 1:57:10| about how they're going to operate their railroad and how they're going to partner with local, state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| and federal government for intermodal facilities and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| and the passenger and previous CEO, Mr. Good, made a strong statement about that before he went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7041)|
| 1:57:28| And so it strikes me that that's something I know, and I guess Councilman Bailey had to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7048)|
| 1:57:35| but he's got some-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| I was looking over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| I know he's got some ongoing, long-term relationships with some people at NS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7061)|
| 1:57:48| and I would assume that he may have some opinions on that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| but I can tell you that based on my knowledge, and I'm not an expert on NS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7072)|
| 1:57:59| I know some people from NS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| I have a brother-in-law who retired from NS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| but my impression is that it's worth talking to pursue that more, let me put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7084)|
| 1:58:13| Now, Mr. Gary, going on, I have another question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7093)|
| 1:58:20| You told me when the 33 sites were laid out to investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7100)|
| 1:58:28| you told me, and my understanding is that you told some other people this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| that those sites-and you told me this very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| I remember that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| You said, what we're going to do is we're going to evaluate those 33 sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| and out of those 33 sites, we're going to come up with a short list of seven sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| Your number that you gave me was seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| and we're going to present those seven, the seven top-ranked sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| we're going to present those at the first public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| Well, the first public meeting came along and we weren't presented seven sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| We were presented five sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| and I'm sure you have lots of good reasons for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| but the point is that you said seven were going to be presented to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| According to your ranking, according to your matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| you were going to present the top seven sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| and you didn't do what you said you were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| We're talking about-Don Mischel talks about this great extensive public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| Well, part of a good public process is telling the truth and doing what you said you were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| To me, that really disturbed me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| and to this day, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| I mean, other than this bureaucratic notion of, well, these sites aren't going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| so why should we bother putting them forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| Because that's what you said you were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| You said we're going to put the top seven ranked sites out in this public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| so people can see for themselves how we ranked them and which ones those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| and you didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| Can you say why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| I don't recall the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| but when we presented the 34 sites, there were five shortlisted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7204)|
| 2:00:11| but all 34 were presented, and so we were receiving comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| That's not what you told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| You told me in that conversation, well, 34,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| you said we're going to present seven of these 34,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| we're going to take them to the public meeting and present them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| and that's not what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| Okay, enough said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| I'm very disappointed that that happened, that that wasn't handled differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| And I think, if I understand correctly, the Jackson Avenue site was in that top seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7238)|
| 2:00:45| The Jackson Avenue site was evaluated and it had a fatal flaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7245)|
| 2:00:49| No, no, that's not my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| The Jackson Avenue site was or was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| I only stated it as a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| Was it or was it not within the top seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| In the evaluation, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| Based on what you said you were going to do, it would have been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| and then you could have presented the fatal flaw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| which would have been a perfectly reasonable thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| but you didn't do what you said you were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| I don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| I won't belabor that one anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| I don't see any other councilman in the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| I know we have at least one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| I do have another question for somebody else, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| And then what we can do is after that, I hope we move to maybe some public input here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| I know we have at least the potentially affected property owner's son who is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| who wishes to read into the record the letter that was given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| I see a lot of individuals out there, and I wonder if some of them wish to be heard also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| So I want to make sure we allow opportunity for that as I see some folk beginning to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7306)|
| 2:01:51| So go ahead, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| Councilman Grossman, I have a question for you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| Prior to the last public meeting, myself and Gregor Smee, an architect here in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7324)|
| 2:02:13| met with yourself and your colleague at Downtown Grind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7333)|
| 2:02:20| And I think one other architect joined us somewhere during that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7340)|
| 2:02:27| But you said at the time, in response to something that was asked of you, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7347)|
| 2:02:36| you said that in the actual site selection process, you all, meaning yourself and Ms. Riggs-Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7356)|
| 2:02:46| were not involved in that process and were not consulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7366)|
| 2:02:52| We were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| We had the opportunity to comment, but we were not directly involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| But we had the opportunity to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| That process was part of the work of Wilbur Smith, under their leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7381)|
| 2:03:09| Their highly qualified national engineering firm has done some exciting studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| for transit facilities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| And in truth, I mean, they have tremendous expertise in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| Then I guess I have a question for Don and Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7404)|
| 2:03:32| I appreciate what you said about Wilbur, Wilbur Smith, or Wilbur, as some people call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7412)|
| 2:03:37| It's a very well-known national, actually international firm, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| with offices all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| And I've certainly met people at conferences who are very, very qualified at Wilbur in terms of transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7423)|
| 2:03:50| I know there's a tremendous depth of experience there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| Can you tell me who, other than people from the local office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| were involved in the siting study from Wilbur in this selection process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| Are you talking about the 2006 siting study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| Yes, this current one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| Well, we had, at that time, we had myself and Tim Sorensen, which is in our Lexington office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| who is our director of transit at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| I've met someone from the Lexington office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| He has moved from Connecticut office to Lexington office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| I think I did meet him, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| He's actually done some studies here with the TPO, Cades Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7466)|
| 2:04:31| So he was involved in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| On the sheet so I can go down in an orderly fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| And if you would like to, please go over and sign the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| But I think, counsel, you have a client here that you wanted to read the statement of the potentially affected property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7484)|
| 2:04:51| on his record, or are you going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| I'd like to have David Zina read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| And if I may, I'd like to make two quick brief points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| Well, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| Before you do that, in other words, public forum, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| You give us your name and your address, and the time is 7-08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| I'm John Buckingham, and my office is at 1 Center Square in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7510)|
| 2:05:16| The two points I'd like to make are that the site study preferred site recommendation chart that you've seen up on your screens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7516)|
| 2:05:30| has a, in our view, a significant defect in that it has no consideration whatsoever for the potentially displaced party occupying the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7530)|
| 2:05:45| That was not taken into consideration in this ranking factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| And the other thing is, is that I want to observe that there were comments being made about this being a, people being finalists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7549)|
| 2:06:01| semi-finalists and finalists, and it has kind of the connotation this time of year of the March Madness and Sweet Sixteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7561)|
| 2:06:10| and things of that nature and maybe the Final Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| And I can assure you that the potentially affected party is not a happy champion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| And Mr. Zena would like to read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| Please give us your name, address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| The time is 7-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| My name is David Zena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| It's currently office address 301 East Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| I'm here to speak on behalf of my employer and father, American Accessories President Eric Zena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| The following statement addressed to this audience regarding the city's continued pursuit of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7608)|
| 2:06:55| I apologize for not being able to attend tonight's discussion as I am currently in Rochester, New York, in meetings with the Kodak Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7615)|
| 2:07:02| Our three-year manufacturing agreement expires in a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| and I must focus on our company's short-term and long-term objectives at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| I do want to thank the members of council who have taken the time to visit our company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| in an attempt to obtain a better understanding of American Accessories International.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7634)|
| 2:07:20| I also realize conflicts have just not made it possible to meet with Council Members Brown and Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| Hopefully, our schedules will meet and we can get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| By all means, the invitation is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| Over the last few months, this process has been like a whirlwind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| In just over one month, we went from not being considered to potential to selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7656)|
| 2:07:42| While the city reviewed options over an eight-year period, we were considered and selected in approximately 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| When I showed up to the first meeting, all our other properties still under consideration had been discussed with their owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7668)|
| 2:07:56| Lawyers were present to oppose the Main Street site as they had been developing an argument for months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| complete with petitions being signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| The Coliseum site was being thrown out due to its distance from downtown, even though it sat only 600 feet from our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| Bill Lyons noted the property owner of the depot site had been notified and they were a willing seller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| and the city and county had engaged in talks to the viability of the State Street site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| The bottom line was a lot of conversation was taking place without any communication with my company or me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7702)|
| 2:08:28| When I asked Mr. Lyons to present the position of the property owner of the Church Street site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| he simply pointed out that they were not a willing seller, even though he had received a letter outlining our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7713)|
| 2:08:41| Since the city was not going to present our position or concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| I was compelled to speak on behalf of our company and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| It was clear from the first meeting we were being blindsided by the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| During the meeting and our presentation, the community was appalled that we had not been contacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7734)|
| 2:08:59| not one person beyond the presenters spoke in favor of our property being used for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7739)|
| 2:09:08| The only person to comment when asked for any other comments on the site said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7748)|
| 2:09:16| yes, I have a comment, don't take the man's property, move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| At the conclusion of the meeting, we were thrilled when Ms. Pillow approached me to show support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| The second public meeting was more the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| This time, though, the rules had changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| Instead of one open discussion, we were told we had three minutes to comment for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| and that any open discussion would take place after the first session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| What we did not know at the time was that only the first part would be on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| while discussions that followed would not be documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| It was in this meeting that the PBA presented the scorecard for site selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| Only CAD officials and transportation consultants were allowed to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| and absolutely zero value was given to the effect on an established business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| What was the point in having what has been described as a very open process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| if the final determination was going to be so biased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| This entire process has been flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| But my understanding is this meeting is to discuss the selection of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| and not only the selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| Therefore, I must remove my company hat and put on my civic hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7816)|
| 2:10:20| I say this because if, and that is with a capital I and F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| if the city is in a position to present American Accessories with a plan that will allow us to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7824)|
| 2:10:30| into an equivalent presentation property without damage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| then the decision should probably lie with our civic leaders and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| As I agreed, I have allowed Jeff Fletcher to review our property, leases, and financials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7837)|
| 2:10:42| to estimate the most accurate appraisal he can within the limits of condemnation law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7842)|
| 2:10:48| He has made it clear that he cannot simply look at the replacement value or even a market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7848)|
| 2:10:54| based on what we may be able to market our property over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| The appraisal process is based on a willing seller and a willing buyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| and is bound by the guidelines of the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7862)|
| 2:11:07| This is why we are concerned we will not receive a number near what it would take to replace our building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| with a similar presentation property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| Nonetheless, we shall know a number by the first of next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7874)|
| 2:11:18| and I look forward to the city's plans to address the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| I am pleased to report that the mayor has been forward over the last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| in wanting to schedule time to get together and discuss options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| Given our two schedules, it has not been an easy task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| That being said, as a citizen, I do not understand the logic of taking nearly 25 million hard-earned tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7896)|
| 2:11:43| to tear down one of the most stately buildings in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| a building that was designed by Barbara McMurray in the mid-70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| and to this day presents an image of commercial stability and moving forward in design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7912)|
| 2:11:58| I have had senior executives from around the world visit our offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| and comment on the design and presentation of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| I've had architecture students from the University of Tennessee comment on the timeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| forward-thinking design of our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| What is the logic of tearing down developed property when other options exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| and those same nearly 25 million tax dollars that we all paid into could be used to develop a part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7935)|
| 2:12:22| that needs support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| As a citizen, why would we want to displace a viable taxpaying corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| when economic development is a prime objective of the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| I feel these are extremely valid questions that have not been clearly answered to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| I am pleased that by standing firm on our position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| we have been able to instigate communication and meetings like we are having tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| before we have traveled too far down the road and we cannot turn back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| In closing, and maybe putting my American Accessories hat back on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| I can't help but believe that if we were a $20 million company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| and a $1.3 million local payroll that had contributed over $2.0 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| in federal, state, and local taxes in 2006, but we were located outside the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7984)|
| 2:13:09| then the city of Knoxville would be turning flips to move us into the downtown business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| I just hope we don't have to leave to become attractive again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| Did anyone sign up Madam Recorder to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| While she's looking, is there anyone else here from the public who wishes to be heard at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8009)|
| 2:13:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| Councilman Holcomb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| Just to follow up with Mr. Galleon, you said two weeks on the constructability analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8019)|
| 2:13:47| Or is it the construction or cost estimates are available now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8027)|
| 2:13:54| Can those be delivered to the city council office tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| I think what we'll try to do is get you a clean document with all of these documents that make them legible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8037)|
| 2:14:04| I don't think we can get them tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| We don't have to wait two weeks to get the construction estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| Give me a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| Wednesday of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| Let me also say, council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| if you want to make sure that a clean copy of the letter provided to the court recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| that she can make it a part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8065)|
| 2:14:30| Seeing no further lights from council, no one else wishing to be heard on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop070125transitdiscussion?start=8074)|
