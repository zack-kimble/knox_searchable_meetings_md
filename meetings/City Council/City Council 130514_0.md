| 0:03:31| Good evening. I am Ola Blackman McBride, 1145 Winding Way Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=211)|
| 0:03:43| To Mayor O'Hara and the City Council, we want to thank you for this opportunity to come before you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| to present the Police Advisory and Review Committee 2012 annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| Within the report that all of you should have received, you will see our operations report for 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| In 2012, you will note that the cases that came before us went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| To us, that's a sign that things are working well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| that the Police Advisory and Review Committee is doing what it's supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| Before I go further, I want to acknowledge the hard work of the Executive Director, Mrs. Avis Reed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| and her assistant, Lisa Chambers, who do the day-to-day operations, Ms. Reed and Ms. Chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| But also joining us tonight is another part member, Steve Fisher, so I want to acknowledge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| I also would like to acknowledge Chief Ross, who's not here but is a representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| for his support and assistance in working with the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| We continue to meet quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| We meet in all sectors of the city to provide access to the citizens of Knoxville so they have an opportunity to come out and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=296)|
| 0:05:06| We also, the Park Office, continue to be active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| and Neighborhood Watch Associations as well as the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=310)|
| 0:05:18| And again, we thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| And if there's any questions in regards to the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| I believe Council will take some time to review it and then give you a call or Ms. Reed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| we certainly appreciate your service as chair of this committee and the full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| Thank you for serving in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| And we acknowledge, we also recognize the great work that Avis Reed and Lisa do, so we appreciate them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=340)|
| 0:05:50| Okay, continue the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| Council, late this afternoon, so you may not have seen it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| the police department, Chief Roush and I announced that Captain Monty Houck is the new deputy chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=357)|
| 0:06:08| as you all know with Gus Pedousis resigning, retiring from the city to go over to the school system for their security chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=368)|
| 0:06:17| That left a deputy chief position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| And so Chief Roush has appointed Captain Monty Houck to the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| He has graduated from the academy in 1989, so he's been with the city for quite a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| and I think you all probably know him and know the expertise that he brings to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| You'll see there probably will be an article in the paper tomorrow that will hit the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| but I just as a mayor want to congratulate now Deputy Chief Houck for moving into that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| I know he'll continue the great service that he has provided us for so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| Also today, Secretary of State Trey Hargett visited my office along with Senator Becky Duncan Massey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=414)|
| 0:07:03| and our state reps Gloria Johnson and Harry Brooke, and they delivered a check for $5,000 for archives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| This is a check from the Secretary of State's office, and they provide grants to different cities throughout the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| and this $5,000 will allow us to preserve some of our archives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| And Janet Wright from our information systems, Janet, you're somewhere, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| She applied for the grant, and she's the one responsible for making sure it gets spent appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| So we appreciate the Secretary of State for personally delivering that check to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| Also today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Fight him back, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Yeah, well, yeah, I told him any time he had a big old check, you know, to come on by, that was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| Tomorrow, Wednesday the 15th, Mayor Burchett and I will hold a press conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| to announce a regional initiative to promote competitive airfares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| I mentioned this at the budget address a little while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| The Competitive Airfare Partnership, or CAP, is part of an Innovation Valley strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| to encourage business relocation and industrial development efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| Of course, it doesn't hurt us, either, those of us locally who want to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| The press conference will be held at 1.45 p.m. at McGee-Tyson Airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| on the second level outside the terminal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| So we hope to see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| Also at 10 a.m. on Friday, Chief Rausch and KPD will take part, all of us will take part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| in a law enforcement memorial service to honor our fallen officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| Representatives from local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies are scheduled to attend the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| which will be at the Maricosta Plaza behind the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| This is a service that we observe each year during Peace Officer Memorial Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| And I know you all join with me in thanking our police officers for their sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| and invite the public to come and show their support as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| So that's Friday at 10 a.m. at the Maricosta Plaza at the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| Also on Friday, right afterwards at 11 a.m., we'll be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| Well, actually in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| And the IBM Smarter Cities team, who's been here three weeks, working with us and many of our partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| they will be delivering their analysis and their recommendations for how we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| As you all recall, we're trying to reduce the emergency utility bills that our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=568)|
| 0:09:35| many people in our community have each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| and a lot of good folks try and meet those needs and contribute to KUB for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| And we're trying to address that and coordinate that with the weatherization and energy efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| and upgrade resources that we have in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| And finally, this is National Public Works Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| And you all know that we have many hardworking employees, and it's always an honor for us to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=595)|
| 0:10:03| Tonight, as part of National Public Works Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| I'm going to present a proclamation to celebrate the employees in public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| This is Kristi Branscom, who is our Senior Director of Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| for about three more weeks before she moves up to fill the big shoes of Eddie Maness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| She is here, and I'm going to thank you, Kristi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| to pass that on to all of the employees that are here in the city for all that they do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| As you all know, public works is really the umbrella for four departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| Engineering, which includes civil, traffic, and stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| Our public service, a department which has codes enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| also the building permits and inspections and zoning, and the parks and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| All of those are part of public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| We have 1,600 full and part-time employees within the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| and about a little more than 25 percent of them, about 460, are in that public works category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| So it's a big part of our operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| And those are the people that are out there day and night to keep our city going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| So on behalf of all the citizens of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| I'm going to read this and then hand it over to Kristi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| But this is a proclamation on behalf of the people of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| to publicly recognize Public Works Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| whereas public works infrastructure, facilities, and services are of vital importance to the health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| safety, economy, and overall well-being of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| and whereas the city of Knoxville's public works department includes building inspections and permits and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| engineering, parks and rec, and public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| and whereas these divisions together are responsible for setting and protecting development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| for our neighborhoods and businesses, maintaining our roadways and sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| providing parks and greenways for our citizens, planting trees, mowing grass, collecting yard waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| and generally ensuring the quality of life in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| and whereas these services could not be provided without the dedicated efforts of public works professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| engineers, and administrators at all levels of city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| and whereas the year 2013 marks the 53rd annual National Public Works Week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| sponsored by the American Public Works Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Now, therefore, I proclaim May 19th to 25th to be Public Works Week in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| and urge all citizens to join in this observance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| And I'm going to walk over and give this to Christy, and I think Christy's got a few comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| Yeah, I'll share those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=762)|
| 0:13:02| Just briefly, I just need to mention we have our director of engineering, Jim Hagerman, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| I want to recognize him and his department for all of their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| They pave approximately 50 miles of city streets per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=790)|

| 0:13:18| and our building permits and inspections department need to acknowledge our director, Tom Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| who does a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=803)|

| 0:13:31| For the public service department, I want to acknowledge David Brace, the director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| and Deputy Director Chad Weth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| They have 304 employees in the public service department and a budget of $33 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| And the parks and rec department, I want to acknowledge Joe Walsh as the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| We manage over 2,000 acres of parks in the city, operate after-school programs at 12 different sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| and register over 150,000 participants in those activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| So I wanted to invite everyone to celebrate Public Works Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=837)|

| 0:14:09| So if anyone would like to join us, please come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Okay, that's the end of the mayor's report, so we'll go on to Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| I just want to announce that we'll be holding our annual budget hearings in this very room next Tuesday, the 21st, beginning at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=859)|
| 0:14:28| We'll conclude as close to 5 o'clock as we can with public forum at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| And folks are welcome to come in and hear the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| I'm sure it will be deep and robust at times, even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| And I also want to just mention a festival occurred over the past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| It had a great crowd of about 1,200 folks despite some rain, intermittent rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| But it was still a very good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Great music, great craft vendors, food vendors, and just a display of art and just a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=895)|
| 0:15:03| So for those of you who came to South Knoxville, we appreciate that and hope that you'll come back next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| And obviously if you weren't there, then come experience the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| It's a lot of fun and a very unique experience in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| A lot of great music there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Needless to say, there's been a few activities in the 2nd District the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| But one thing that I want to bring up, I talked to Chief Roush and have talked to engineering that if there's any relief that can be given to North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=924)|
| 0:15:33| and Kingston Pike, I know that the lights have been looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| And I did talk to the chief that, you know, we can get 110,000 people out of UT in a couple hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| but we've got traffic backed up from Kingston Pike up to almost Panera's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| And so if there's some way that we can get the police down there, especially during rush hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| needless to say I'm getting a lot of telephone calls on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| I'm sure some of the rest of you have heard from some folks as far as the backup of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| So if there's something that can be done, you know, between the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| and maybe working on the signal arrows to turn left and right, that would certainly be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| The other thing is one of my favorite topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| Mr. Swanson, could you give us an update on the shingles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| Well, it pleases the report that at both locations, both east and west, the shingles are being ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| and the piles are diminishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| It's sometimes a little difficult to tell that the piles are diminishing because they were so substantial to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| But they are diminishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| They are being recycled and hopefully used to make a form of asphalt that can be used in the roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=995)|
| 0:16:44| So that is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| We are sending inspectors out on a regular basis to make sure that the work continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| It's not going as rapidly as we hoped that it would go, but it's going steadily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| And as long as it continues to go steadily, then everything will go well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| If not, then we'll have to take another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Any other reports or counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| We're on 8A, Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1032)|

| 0:17:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| 9A, an ordinance appropriating the sum of $5,340 from the Parks and Recreation Department's Grants and Benevolence Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1056)|

| 0:17:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1072)|

| 0:18:28| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Mayor, members of Council, I'm John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| I'm here on behalf of three clients who are in opposition to the closing of this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| I would like to ask for a postponement of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| Two weeks ago when we were here, the matter was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Mr. King, normally in this process we first have the people that are supporting it and then secondly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1132)|
| 0:18:59| I was going to ask for the postponement before we got into a discussion of the merits, but it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| You're going to end up having a merits discussion, I assume, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| I'd like to go ahead and have the discussion since a number of the parties are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| We'll call you back up in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Thank you for trying to move it along, but I don't think that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| First, I have a hard time reading this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| I think Scott Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| I have three people signed up for 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Hi, Mr. Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Tony Cappiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| I have Scott Bishop, Tony Cappiello, and Mary Lee Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| Am I reading this correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| And then Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| So, Mr. Bishop, you can come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| According to council rules, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| I'm going to set the little timer, so if you would please give your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| and I'll get the timer going for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Thanks for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| My name is Scott Bishop, 104 Westwood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| I do want to speak in favor of the road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| I both live and work in Bearden and have done one or both of those things for 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| and I'm really pretty strongly invested in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| I'm also here tonight wearing more than one hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| As a business owner a couple blocks away from this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| as someone who lives basically up the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| I'm also here representing the district in Bearden and the Bearden Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| all of whom are supporting the closure of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| It is not, as you know, tremendously uncommon for such property to be deeded over to developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| to enhance quality developments in neighborhoods where major ingress and egress is not affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| And since the developer has agreed to a narrower than the street is now easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| permanent easement, fronting Kingston Pike and on Homburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| there doesn't seem to be any real reason to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| It's also, I think, going to really enhance the Bearden Village plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| which is something the city has been working on for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| It's going to make the whole area much more pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Having a street remain there cutting through will cut down on the potential for pedestrian traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| and we really, all of us who live and work there, want it to be more pedestrian friendly all up and down the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| which is why we have advocated for traffic calming and a lot of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| And we also think that the way this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| which has not been exactly a visual asset to the neighborhood for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| is going to be made one of the most attractive parts of Bearden altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| And I think that's really part of what this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| because closing the road gives the development a cohesion and a togetherness, a connectedness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1325)|
| 0:22:12| that will enhance that pedestrian friendly quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| and make people much more likely to park and walk from shop to shop and business to business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| And with any luck at all, that sort of thing will begin creeping out to other parts of Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| and making even more of it more pedestrian friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| in much the same way that the greenway, which now stretches all the way down to Westwood Road, has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| There will be much more pedestrian traffic on Sutherland because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| and we think this can do the same thing on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| There are still three other ready ways to get into Homburg Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| either end of Homburg itself and the traffic light at Mojica,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| which is especially handy if you're trying to turn left onto the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| since there is no light at Ben Ashley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| and wouldn't be because it doesn't have a sufficient amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| The best left turn would be one block away at Mojica Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| Coming from the west to get onto Homburg at the Y there in front of Naples is a very simple operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1387)|
| 0:23:17| It's not where I would want to go to turn left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| but, again, I already addressed that because there is a traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| I just think the whole thing is a big plus for the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| I also think this is going to draw a lot more people to shop in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| which is an increase for merchants who pay business taxes, who pay sales tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| the increased property tax revenue that this sort of thing always brings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| because when you spiff up one part of the neighborhood, then somebody spiffs up another part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| and pretty soon you've got a whole lot of much nicer property that gets reappraised upwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| which the owners may not always care for, but which is always good for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| because if the city can't get sufficient tax revenue, it can't fund the things that everyone wants to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| And so this is a great way to help that process along just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| And I just can't see any reason why it would not be to the overall long-term benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| of both the Bearden neighborhood and the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| And I have not spoken to anyone in my neighborhood who opposes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| Of the 32 members of the district in Bearden, it's either 30 or 31 who support the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| The Bearden Council supports the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| I know MPC staff supported the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| I can't see any really compelling argument to not go ahead and do the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| And that's really all I have to say, unless someone wanted to ask me something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| Thank you very much, Mr. Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Mr. Cappiello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| State your name and address for the record, and I'll get the timer going for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| My name is Anthony Cappiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| I live at 3004 Kingston Pike with an office address in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| My family's been here since the 1940s, and this particular property where I'm bringing anthropology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| has been owned by my family since 1960 for 53 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| I've provided each of you a packet, and I might just step through that real quickly to show you what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| That might answer a few questions, and then I'd be glad to give further history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1531)|
| 0:25:38| It starts with just a brief history of working with anthropology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| As you may know, anthropology is a subsidiary of Urban Outfitters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| I've been working with this organization for over two years to attract them to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| and specifically to the Bearden community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| As I said in my summary, they typically look at a number of locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| That's their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| They looked at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| They looked at downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| They looked at West Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| But a tribute to them, they like unique buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| and they like kind of neighborhoods that have an artsy feel to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| So I kept working with them and trying to entice them to come to Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| and we situated on this particular building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| This, as I said, started two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| The next couple of pages you'll see in your packet is an article that was written by Forbes in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| Anthropology is pretty close to the vest on their sales and their activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| But in this particular article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| it stated that their average sales per square foot for an average store is $750 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1606)|
| 0:26:54| Taking that on the basis of the building that they'll be occupying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| this store should generate revenue of over $8 million per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| which should yield sales tax to the state and to the city in combination of over $700,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| and that's just this one store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| They act as the anchor to this whole development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| and the reason that I acquired additional property to build the shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| and to bring other quality tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| I have a laundry list of tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| They want to be next to Anthropology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| One of the reasons I know Mr. King is going to ask for continuance tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| I've held these people, a lot of these tenants, at bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Some of them are national retailers, regional franchisees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| and we've been delaying this process, and it's been a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| and I would like to give them either a yes or no tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| So I'm opposed to continuing it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| After the article about Anthropology, I've included a revised site plan, which is a fold-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| This is a couple revisions we've made, and this, working with my site engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| we've come up with the idea of proposing a private easement to the three property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| This would be a perpetual easement only if all four parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| the ones that own this property and the ones that own those three properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| if they agreed to change it or make a change, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| Otherwise, this roadway, basically it's a reduced roadway, would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| And what that does for me, it allows an additional 23 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| I am having, for Anthropology's purposes, to borrow 17 spaces on the backyard burger site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| We're very compact, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| In all of Bearden, it's difficult for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| So this would allow still access between Homburg and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| yet allow 21 spaces additional for parking for this whole development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| It really helps the development but does not limit access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| and it allows because it's a private easement for people to back into that roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| Otherwise, they would not be able to if it were a steady street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| The next few pages you'll see are just color renderings of the development I propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| Again, Anthropology loved the building that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| It took a lot of work just to make it structurally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| the integrity of the structure to hold this building for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| It used to be an old roller skating rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| One of the things they loved about it was that it had a barrel roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| and kind of a Quonset hut look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| So I've taken that, as you flip through these pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| and I've applied that not only to the new shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| but to the other existing buildings to give it a real sense of cohesion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| to make it feel like a community and an overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1791)|
| 0:29:59| Next, I know there's been some discussion about that there hasn't been really a precedence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| for closing roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I've attached that I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| There's 76...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Sorry, I didn't give you the warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Can we go ahead and give you a couple more minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| Yeah, just wrap it up, just a couple more sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| The next you'll see precedence of 76 roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| rights-of-way that have been closed since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| And Ms. Fox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1832)|
| 0:30:43| Please state your name and address for the record, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| I'm Mary Lee Fox, and I'm the owner of Gift Gorman G&G Interiors in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1849)|
| 0:30:58| 5508 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| And we're in Cherokee Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| The Watkins family developed Cherokee Plaza about five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| and they had a great vision, I feel like, to improve and revitalize the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1868)|
| 0:31:16| And as a business owner in a really very challenging economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| I think it's very important to take advantage of this opportunity we have to welcome a very well-known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| and popular retail store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| I feel like it will benefit everyone in the Bearden community to have anthropology there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| And I think it's great, and as Tony said, that they want to come to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| They could go to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| They could go to a mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| They could go to a lot of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| And I feel like it's a huge benefit to our area and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| And I think one of the main points that we are in favor of is being able to walk from store to store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| And this is just such an appealing idea, and we've all talked about it in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| They've talked about being able to walk from store to store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| that that really enhances just convenience for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| It makes it so much more quaint and convenient, charming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| And I think people really like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| And having plenty of parking and accessibility, I feel like those things are key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| because people are so about convenience, and they want to just park their car and be able to do lunch and shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1943)|
| 0:32:31| So I feel like that that is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| And I really don't think you can put a dollar amount on the value that it will add to this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1955)|
| 0:32:43| excuse me, what they will bring, and just the financial resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| and the things that they can add to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| And I do think, you know, as a high-end retail store, I mean, they are definitely competition for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| And they have gifts and lots of things that we all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| But I do feel like it's so critical to embrace them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| and make it good for everyone in our area for them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| And I think if you look at, like, Nashville and Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| they have these great areas where you can walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| and I feel like people go to those places as destination shopping areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| In Nashville, they have the Hill Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| You know, it's a great area like this where people can walk, and it's very pedestrian-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| And Chattanooga, they've renovated Warehouse Row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| and it's just so much more of a metropolitan great feel, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| And I do think that even if parts of this are inconvenient or uncomfortable for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| it's just important to realize how valuable it is and what a great benefit it is to have this here and be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2027)|
| 0:33:57| And we're actually probably the furthest away from the walking distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| but hopefully this will be something that will just continue to grow in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| And it takes so many financial resources to be able to do something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| and besides that, it takes dedication and having a good vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| And I just feel like that we all need to look at what a great plan this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| and how much it will benefit all of us, not only in the Bearden community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| but in Knoxville and just in our whole city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Now, Mr. King, you have five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2076)|
| 0:34:44| and please state your name and address for the record, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2084)|
| 0:34:56| And you're the only speaker for your side, is that correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2096)|
| 0:35:05| I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| If anybody else is going to speak, I'm unaware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| And when we get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| I would like to observe that the proponents of this have used at least a total of 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| If I'm going to be the only speaker in opposition, am I limited to only five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| I have a lot to cover if, in fact, we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| My first purpose here is to request, as I said earlier, a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2129)|
| 0:35:37| When we were here two weeks ago, Mr. Capiello and Councilman Greene approached me the day of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2137)|
| 0:35:48| about a postponement, or maybe the day before, to which I agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| At the time, I said to Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| I did not believe two weeks was enough time to grant us the opportunity to have discourse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| to have a discussion about this matter, given the number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| Mr. Seymour's response was, let's go ahead and do it for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| and keep the heat on everybody to try to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| If we need to postpone it again, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| Starting at midweek last week, not having heard anything from Mr. Capiello as to what was being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2186)|
| 0:36:34| or what was to be discussed in the way of a, quote, compromise, close quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| not having heard anything, I started calling Mr. Seymour to get information about this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2202)|
| 0:36:52| for the purpose of discussing it with my client and being able to have some time to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| I got the proposal yesterday afternoon at about 2.30 at Councilman Greene's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2219)|
| 0:37:07| I had one client out of town and another just coming into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| I was able to get with them just yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| And I have not had time since those meetings, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| to have the kind of time I'd like to talk about this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| Fair is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| They had two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I'd like to have two weeks to talk to my clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| and evaluate this proposal about a joint permanent easement because it carries with it liabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2257)|
| 0:37:51| and obligations on the parties that aren't currently there that they're going to be, if you will, responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2271)|
| 0:38:01| They need to fully understand and evaluate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| And also, if they're going to do it, we need to make sure that there are certain other things in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| that protect their interests as it relates to those legal obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2290)|
| 0:38:17| I had pointed some of those out in the meeting I had with Councilman Greene and Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| I think they acknowledged that those are issues and problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| We haven't had a chance to work through all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| Further to the point, I got this yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| It's sort of like, here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| This is the only option available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| I believe there are some other options or alternatives that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| that don't necessarily involve closing the road and yet give Mr. Cappiello everything he wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| or needs in order to go forward in his development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| I'd like to explore those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Mr. Cappiello apparently has not, but I think if he's not going to, I'm willing to go see about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2337)|
| 0:39:07| So I'd like to have the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Council, is there any motion to postpone or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| Do you want to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| So there's no motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| I was going to say let's give him five minutes to tell us what his opposition is, and let's hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2368)|
| 0:39:37| I don't think we have a motion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| It's come this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| I think it's worth hearing the other side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| So, Mr. King, I'm now going to start the timer again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| And you'll have up to five minutes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| Do I only have five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Well, I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| I approve to go ahead and give him ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| Is that technically correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| That's a motion to amend the rules or to suspend the rules in order to allow ten minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| because the rules currently provide for five minutes per speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| But you can suspend the rules and give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| I'll hear a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| I'll suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| And give an extra five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Five minutes will be a total of ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Mr. King, you have ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| Before I start, I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| I won't start it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| You need a smaller box, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| He's got more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| First are petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| Are we starting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| I'm just going to pass this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| It's a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| You have a petition already, but this is in addition to the ones you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| That goes with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| And then here, Ken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| The other copies and everything, give them to each member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2462)|
| 0:41:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2479)|
| 0:41:37| We'll need some up here too, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| Do you want to amend your thing to seven minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| Do you want to amend to seven minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| First, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Are we starting his ten minutes now, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| You ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| I guess so, but I may have to ask for leniency when we get to the end of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| Okay, well, we're starting your ten minutes now, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| We want to hear what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| If that happens, we're going to have to give the other side time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Those in opposition to the closing of Ben Ashley Street, please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2537)|
| 0:42:27| Madam Mayor and members of council, we're not here because we did something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2547)|
| 0:42:35| We built our improvements at substantial investment years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| I represent the owners of Southern Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| I represent the owners of Southern Management and Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| And I represent Dr. and Mrs. Phillips, beg your pardon, and their properties at the vet clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2568)|
| 0:43:00| And all those facilities, particularly Southern Market and the vet clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| built based on a known and an existing network roadway and a reliance on those roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| including Ben Ashley Street, which I would note was named for a man whose many years of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| and political service was based on principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| But we're not here today to close Ben Ashley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| because that's the only way to get anthropology to come to Mr. Cappiello's development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| We now know that that assertion previously made by Mr. Cappiello at the time, that assertion is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2611)|
| 0:43:41| We're not here tonight to close Ben Ashley Street because that's the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| that Mr. Cappiello can develop the rest of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| He can develop the remainder and still leave Ben Ashley Street open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| We're not here because of the location of a pie shop that he wanted to have a drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| and thus necessitate the close of Ben Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| That's been changed and we no longer have a drive-through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| When the Sexton's built their property, Southern Market, they wanted a 10,000-square-foot building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| but it had to be reduced because there was not sufficient parking available to have a building of that size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| so they reduced it to 8,300 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Mr. Cappiello could do that if, in fact, he has a shortage of parking spaces, and I respectfully think he does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2671)|
| 0:44:41| He just doesn't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| What he wants to do is the development size that he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| And I submit even at that, for what he wants, it can still be done without closing Ben Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2691)|
| 0:45:00| I can illustrate, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| It's going to be a little hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| But, for example, this is his proposed, this shaded area is his proposed joint permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2710)|
| 0:45:21| Currently, the boundary of Ben Ashley Street is that dark line right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| and the outside edge or the, if you will, the eastern edge of the shaded area that he shows as that permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| That's the current street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| And I respectfully submit that he can leave that street open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| lose some of his parking spaces that currently show, in essence, in the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| and yet retain, and I believe a request to city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| there's justification for them to permit diagonal parking on a portion of this property and the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2758)|
| 0:46:10| permit diagonal parking and, for that matter, parallel parking on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| What I'm saying is you can, if you wanted to, you could keep the nine spaces on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2777)|
| 0:46:40| There's nine on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2800)|
| 0:47:10| There's 11 on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2830)|
| 0:47:21| On the west side, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Nine on the east, 11 on the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| Plus one more on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| Even parallel parking on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| And you wind up still having more parking spaces than is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| If you keep the nine on the west side and lose everything, I beg your pardon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2861)|
| 0:47:51| keep the nine on the east side and lose everything on the west side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| you still wind up with a shortage of parking spaces of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| And given that, that is clearly a situation where I believe you would get a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| to reduce the required number of spaces by two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| This is what I wanted to explore because I believe the city engineering for a street such as Ben Hatchley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| can support diagonal parking that is laid out that leaves him those parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| and solves his problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| I'm willing to go and talk to city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| I believe that they would approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| It's not that heavily a travel street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| It's heavier than they would like you to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| But I believe that can be done, and I would propose to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| And, unfortunately, I'm not given the time to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| So it's an issue of we're going to close the street or we're not going to close the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| I submit to you that the development can be done without closing the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| and it can be done without causing him any difficulty as far as the number of parking spaces he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2940)|
| 0:49:12| The reason he is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| There's three minutes, just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Gee whiz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| We're not here today because we're obstructionists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| I'm speaking on behalf of my clients and the public's rights to the utilization of a public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| This issue was thrust upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| We didn't seek it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| The reason that this is being sought is, I mean, if you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| it's not there's no compelling public purpose or interest to be served by closing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| Now it's not even required for his private purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| We're here because Mr. Cappiello wants the city to give him public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| And I have said before, and I say again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| that this request is nothing more than a transfer of wealth from the public domain to the private interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| or the increase in value to one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| I've talked about this as a valuable piece of property, and I've said it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| I'll say it again, but it doesn't matter so much what I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| We got an appraiser, an MAI appraiser, Ken Woodford, well-known in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| He does a lot of appraisals for this city and the county and the state, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| And I asked him to find out what the value of this piece of property is that he's asking, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| be closed and transferred to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| His appraisal, which we'll distribute to you now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| tells us that the property that he's asking you to transfer to him by this vote is worth $235,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3042)|
| 0:50:51| It's about a 70-page appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| but it has some good points in it about the fact that the transfer of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| and the potential utilization of this property by someone can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| or could work to the detriment of the surrounding property owners, including the businesses along Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| Closing the road hurts my clients and helps Mr. Capiello to the tune of $235,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3074)|
| 0:51:22| I want to talk about, you know, I'm going to pass you up some information on the traffic counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| but I believe it will demonstrate really clearly that city's numbers are in excess of 300 cars a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| I've got some other photos that I want to give you that show the traffic situation at Mohican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| where trucks, service trucks, park in the street and block the street there for deliveries to those businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| which creates a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| You're talking about adding more traffic to that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| I would want to close by making, I hate to read law books, but I'm forced to sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3115)|
| 0:52:06| I'll tell counsel, we've got like five seconds left, so what is your pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| Go ahead and let him finish, Mayor, or suspend the rules so he can finish or give him five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| What is it, Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Whatever you want to do, if you suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Suspend the rules and add some time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| How much time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Five more minutes, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| I would bring the total to 15 for his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| I'm going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| So is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Sir, Counsel has given you five more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| I have likened what is being proposed here as the reverse side of the coin to condemnation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| and that's the taking of private property of public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| What we're doing here is the reverse side of the coin, taking private property and giving it over to private use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| But so far as you all know, in order for any governmental entity to take property, it has to be by eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3175)|
| 0:53:05| It must be for public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| And we hear a lot of discussion here tonight about increased property taxes, more jobs, and this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| Let me read you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| There was a case up in the northeast that was decided about condemnation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| and there was a flurry of activity and statutes were amended about condemnation, and it was in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| And the statute now reads, public use being defined 2917.102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3207)|
| 0:53:34| Public use shall not include either private use or benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| or the indirect public benefits resulting from private economic development and private commercial enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| including increased tax revenue and increased employment opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| And then it gives some exceptions to that, none of which apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| In essence, they're saying public use, which is what has to be there in order for you to exercise this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| public use doesn't include private use or benefit or indirect public benefits resulting from private economic activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3245)|
| 0:54:14| And I suggest to you that that's precisely what is occurring here on the reverse side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| You're taking public property and turning it over to a private individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| There is no public purpose for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| There is no public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| You're doing it for that private person's benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| and for the wrong reasons that are not authorized by statute when you start talking about public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| Now, I want to go ahead and pass up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| And if you'll come down here, I'll get them for you, find them for you and let you pass them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3284)|
| 0:54:55| How many more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| Who's this been for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3297)|
| 0:55:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3327)|
| 0:55:40| You need to be talking because your time is ticking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| The photos that I passed up are photos of the truck situation I was talking about on Mohegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| It demonstrates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| That picture was made by Mr. Riggedback, who's here in opposition to this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| And he's well familiar with that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3354)|
| 0:56:04| As I said, I've got the traffic counts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| I've got the photos there where traffic situation at Mohegan, nine businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| two restaurants to be served by service vehicles who utilize the street in order to make their deliveries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| All you're doing is adding more traffic to that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| Now, I said that there's no public purpose for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| It started out with anthropology wasn't going to come unless the street got closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| That turned out not to be accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| And then it was an issue about having a rental on a pie shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| Now that has turned out not to be the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| And the truth of it is parking is not really an issue either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| It's just the fact that Mr. Capiello wants this transfer of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3413)|
| 0:57:01| I want to pass up some pictures now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| The first two pictures are the two buildings that are going to be improved, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3423)|
| 0:57:11| The first two pictures are the buildings that will be improved by your transfer of $235,000 worth of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| And the last two pictures that you get, put them all together, Ken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| They all go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| The first two, look at them and pass them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| The first two are the buildings that will be benefited by this $235,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| and the last two buildings being the Southern Market as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| and the vet clinic as an example of properties that will be damaged or reduced in value by this transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3459)|
| 0:57:51| I think it's a startling comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Mr. King, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| I'll close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| Just give me about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| I would ask is it to be the public policy of this city that its public property is to be utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3479)|
| 0:58:07| to fund a private development to the detriment of others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| others who have made their investment and operate their business based upon features that are part of the public domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| This is the same as taking property or turning property over to private individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| There is no public purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| That is not to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| A vote to close this street is nothing more than a vote to give Mr. Capiello a $235,000 grant or subsidy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3509)|
| 0:58:39| because he wants it no matter what, and that's why we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| I would ask that you oppose the closing of Den Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| And now, by council rules, the appellants get a two-minute rebuttal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| Let's see if we can stick to actual timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| You ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| I will, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902, here on behalf of Mr. Capiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3542)|
| 0:59:11| To clarify the record, we are not proposing a joint and permanent easement, as Mr. King has repeatedly said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| We are proposing a private easement roughly located where the existing road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| We would make his clients the beneficiary of that easement so that it could not be closed without their acquiescence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3564)|
| 0:59:35| We have also proposed sidewalks along Homburg Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| We have proposed a crosswalk along Homburg across Homburg Drive from the Southern Market to Mr. Capiello's center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3579)|
| 0:59:49| These are all items that would have to be worked out, but they are or have been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| The proposal initially to consider an easement such as Mr. Capiello has proposed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| was presented at a meeting on April 19, 2013, to Mr. King's clients, he and several of his clients there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3601)|
| 1:00:09| We were told that there would be no compromise that would involve the closure of Ben Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3609)|
| 1:00:17| And we have heard nothing since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| In closing, Mr. Capiello's proposal and this request is supported by people throughout Bearden and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3623)|
| 1:00:33| The business community in Bearden overwhelmingly supports it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| That is the Bearden District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| It was near unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Neighborhood groups in Bearden represented by the Bearden Council support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| Mr. Capiello has a petition that he will submit signed by numerous people who support this road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3649)|
| 1:00:58| And, finally, a number of years ago, the Bearden Village Plan was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| in consultation between the Metropolitan Planning Commission, neighborhood groups, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| And one of the major proposals for that was to make Bearden walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| And that's what Mr. Capiello's proposal is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| I suggest or submit that it's fully in accord with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Now, we are now going to have questions and discussion from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| And before we do so, just thinking ahead here, I want to ñ there are some people in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| Four people have signed up to speak to 11L, which is about the UT, the bus shelters on UT property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3696)|
| 1:01:47| Three said they were against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| The other person didn't indicate if they were for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| So if those people would maybe ñ by council rules, you can have three people speaking up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3712)|
| 1:01:59| So if the four of you, if you're all against it, if you would get together and figure out who your three speakers are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| that will help us move it along, just giving you some advance notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| That's the bus shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| I need to say who those are that signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| That's Hubert Smith, Jim Jennings, Rick Roach, and Umoja Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3734)|
| 1:02:23| If you all would get together and figure out your three speakers, if you were all opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| I can't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Mr. Roach, I can't tell what your position is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| Okay, moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| It's now time for council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| Needless to say, this has been a trying couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| and I think both parties are passionate about what it is that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| One of the problems that I've had is to really fully understand what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| We have a situation where we have a developer who has requested that we close a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3779)|
| 1:03:07| The city road will be turned over to him for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| The property, 50 feet wide and whatever the extension is there, will then go on to the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| The one thing that I have heard from a number of people is the fact that we're beginning to have unified development areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3796)|
| 1:03:25| instead of piecemeal through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| I think that one of the things that has been discussed in the last couple of weeks is that he has agreed to have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3807)|
| 1:03:36| This is what I've heard all along is that we need the access through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| What I've heard lately and even as of today, and I think Mr. King addressed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| that it seems to me that what's really coming out is the real problem is people are having heartburn over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| giving property to a developer in order to enhance his development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| I think one of the things that we have to look at is that we have to look at not only today, but we have to look at the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| Tony has met with, I know, the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| He's met with representatives from the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| He came with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| From that plan, he has agreed to sidewalks all along Homburg, which weren't there or not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| He's agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| He's agreed to a crossover from his parking facility to Southern Markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| He's agreed to allow them to continue to use their parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| He's agreed also, maybe under a little forced pressure from some of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| to landscape the entrance on that easement that he's willing to give so that not only does it define where the entrance is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3873)|
| 1:04:42| but it makes it a much more attractive way not only to go into his development, but also to get to Southern Markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3882)|
| 1:04:49| He's also agreed to, with his 25-foot permanent easement, that that stays with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| Private easement, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Private easement, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| And that if for some reason he sells the property or whatever, that easement stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| And so the access, which has been talked about off and on for the last couple of weeks, will stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| I think that when we look at the Bearden area and we look at what's happening along Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| some of the developments that have occurred, I think we're seeing a great enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| I understand what some folks are saying as far as the anthropology and what the news media had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| but I think that what we're looking at is something far beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| We're looking at what parking is available and how we can enhance that particular piece of property with additional buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3933)|
| 1:05:40| I had personally asked Tony whether or not they could do away with the drive-up window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| I felt that that was some concern that not only did it take away parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| but it also, to me, it caused a safety factor there with the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| The other thing is that I think that some of the ‑‑I'm not sure that, I guess the real question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| I'm not sure there's a compromise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| I know that all the e-mails that I've received and the telephone conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| and even some of the information that we've received tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| that in what little bit of dealings that I've had with the individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| I think some people are dead set that the road stays open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| and I think some people are dead set that the road be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| And so I think it's going to be up to us to look at Bearden, look at the future of Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| look at what this development does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| and I think we have to get beyond the emotional aspect of what's happened in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| I know that I've kind of chastised both lawyers for dragging their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| I've also chastised Tony for the fact that he now realizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| that he should have talked to these people long before they ever came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| You know, we're put in the position where we have to split the baby, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| and this is really something that neighbors could have done ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| I've gotten a number of e-mails, a number of phone calls, both in support and in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| Those in support say, look, you know, you're going to have a business like anthropology there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| It's going to attract other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| We ought to figure out some way that we can unify this development and make it workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| A good friend of mine who is with SACS mentioned to me, called up and said, by the way, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| once you have anthropology there and once you have a decent parking area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| you're going to attract other high-end people to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| Right now, I think Bearden's on a boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| There's a lot of fantastic shops that are in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| There are a lot of good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Sometimes I equate the Bearden area to the Buckhead of Atlanta in terms of where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| and where we're headed with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| I find that I also know being in this position, you can't make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| And so there are going to be some unhappy people and there's going to be some happy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| But I really think that for the future of Bearden, for the future of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| I think that with his commitment to add sidewalks to his total development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| I think we as a city have an opportunity to continue the sidewalks in the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| and really take the Bearden plan and make it what it was meant to be, which is a walkable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| I notice that there's some other business folks out there that are in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| and it's going to be fantastic to be able to walk from one development to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| And so I'm going to support the closure of this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| I think it's in the best interest for the future of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| I think that what it's going to do to that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| and the kind of situation it's going to bring to future businesses, that that's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| So I feel very strongly that we ought to move ahead on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| As far as postponement, I think that I don't see a solution to the two parties in terms of where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| at least where they were as of yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| Are you making a motion at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| I understand that if you're supporting this, the proper motion is to approve the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| and pass the ordinance on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| My counselor is nodding yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| That's what he told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| That's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| So you're passing it on to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Is there a second at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| I'll second that if it has the private easement as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4157)|
| 1:09:25| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| I need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| That really would not be an appropriate amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| That's going to be between private parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| It's not going to be between the city is not going to enforce such an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| And that would really not be an appropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| What we have before us is an appeal of the denial of MPC of the closure of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| And the outcome of that appeal would be the closure of the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| but it would not be appropriate to append to that a requirement of some type of private easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| Would there be a second motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| Could there be a second motion after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| That's what I'm trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| Is there a way we can make sure that that occurs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| I second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Yeah, if you don't pass it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| That would be one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| Make sure that that is accomplished before you pass it on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| would be a way to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| Your attorney has come up with the right answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| Yeah, I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| So is that you're keeping the second then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| George seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| George is seconding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| I'll just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| So, but we can go on record that says that there will be a private easement on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4247)|
| 1:10:58| sidewalks will be included, crosswalk, these type of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| And also, by the way, he has agreed to remove the billboard in seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| Open the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| You're speaking on the record right now, but you cannot make that part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| You have to approve the appeal and adopt the ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| And then, consistent with your attorney's advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| then you wait until those other things are accomplished before you decide to pass it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| So it may not be in two weeks when you pass it on second reading, if you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Anything else, Councilman Graves, at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| I'm just going to walk around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| As many of you know, I work with Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| We work for the same law firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| So due to the professional conflict of interest, I'm not going to be voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| I'll be abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Well, this has been a very interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| All of us have had dozens and dozens of e-mails and phone calls about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| I guess I'm troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| I like the idea of this planned development as looking attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| at least as sketched by the artist and architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| But I'm troubled that we're favoring one citizen over another, and that really troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| These other businesses were on Homburg and rely to some degree on road access and on visual, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4341)|
| 1:12:30| availability from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| It strikes me a little unfair in the sense that we've had road closures before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| but typically it's into one or two persons' property and it dead ends there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| and we close the road and we give each side to the middle of the right-of-way back their fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| without the easement of the road, except sometimes we save utilities or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| But this is a situation where it is a road to somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| Now, there's been an argument it's not a heavily used road, but it is a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| I can foresee a couple things happening down the line that would be troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| One is, you know, two years from now anthropology says, hey, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| we're not making enough money there, we're going to Atlanta or some other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| And we have no control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| This isn't the building for a lifetime of anthropology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| It's a business that picks that as a potential business site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| But it may not be there, so it may not be the be-all and end-all that they would like it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| On the other hand, if it happens, I'm sure it would do some good to the business in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| And I can understand that, and I can understand the efforts to pull this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| The second thing that troubles me is, if it really is that hard to make a left turn onto Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| without going back down to, what is the side street there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| Yeah, go to the side street where there's a traffic light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| you're going to be at the Naples intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| And in five years' time, you're going to be appropriating a million dollars to put a traffic light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| and straighten out the curve there so people have better visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| I mean, it's going to put the burden back on the city to deal with traffic if this occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| So I'm troubled that, as nice as this sounds, we're getting in over our head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| I think the proposal that we heard in the audience to take the sting out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| to remove the other building that's there, the pie place, to give them some visibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| to narrow the road to an easement, but it still gets folks in and out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| that has some interest, because now we're not cutting off folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| but apparently they're either not in a position to agree to that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| or they don't want to agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| But, again, I come back to, I'm troubled that we're favoring one citizen over others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| and it doesn't seem right to me that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| It seems to me that we're picking winners and losers, and people who have established businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| I saw the photographs of the doctor's office and the art supply place in Southern Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| They have a legitimate claim to wanting decent access that's been there since 1927 or 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| So I think I'm opposed to it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| I was tempted to go with the postponement, but I'm not sure there's a will for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| But I certainly would like to see a compromise, and all of these things happen, and it turns out wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| That may be Pollyanna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| Maybe we'll never get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| I'm going to vote against it if we have to decide today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| I agree with Councilman Delavaux, but I really wish that this could be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| I think what Mr. King presented, as far as the parking situation, made a lot of sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4529)|
| 1:15:38| I met with Mr. Cappiello down there Saturday, and I was excited when, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| when he started talking about the easement and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| and then I found out the liability of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| And I'm like, well, you know, I just can't get over that right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| And, you know, the folks, the other folks that are affected bought, built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| and leased property based on that current market, you know, as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| And to go in and change that after the fact, I've got a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| I just don't think that that's the way to go because all this is going to happen regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| I don't really understand what the argument is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| It's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| And my hat's off to the developer for getting a great company like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| and the other vision that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| It's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| It's great for Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| I don't think there's anybody up here that's against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| It's this roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| It's not that we're against the development, and the development is going to happen regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| So to put everybody else at a hardship over three or four parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| and totally, you know, not totally change their business plan and the way people access them, I just can't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4601)|
| 1:16:51| And, again, I wish we could go back and consider a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| and let the attorneys get around the table and talk about the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| But, you know, I don't know that that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| Actually, that is a valid motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| You can make it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| No, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| I want to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Well, like everyone else, I've got more e-mails and more phone calls about this issue than anything else in my 18-month tenure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| And there's a lot of pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Of course, I live in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| I'm in the real estate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| I've studied this request a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| It's not about one particular tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| It's never been about one particular tenant for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| It's about the long-term benefit for Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| and the way it would enhance the development of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| One tenant, you can't make a decision such as this for one tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| I think the compromise that's been reached here with keeping the 25-foot easement is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| And the sidewalks, he's adding back quite a bit of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| Yes, my question, really my primary question is going to go to Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| Tell me a little bit more about this easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| You say private easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| Mr. King referred to it as a joint permanent easement with shared liabilities to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| Are you proposing shared liabilities to that with the property owners or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| It's not a joint permanent easement because that has legal significance under the city's subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4697)|
| 1:18:25| We proposed a private easement basically where part of the roadway is now connecting Kingston Park and Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4705)|
| 1:18:35| To ensure that Mr. Cappiello could not unilaterally close that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| we offered to give them, make one or more of those property owners a beneficiary of that easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4722)|
| 1:18:53| so that it would require their permission and legal consent before it could be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| They say, well, if somebody has an accident on the road or on the easement, we could potentially be liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4739)|
| 1:19:07| Somebody can always sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I was taught the first day in law school you can sue the Bishop of Rome in Rome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| But that doesn't mean you're going to get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| We have easements like this all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| West Town Mall, most shopping centers, more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| I know a recent development of Mr. Cappiello's in Farrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| There were easements like this that were not public roads that benefited several properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| I can't say these people are never going to get sued over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| I assume they carry insurance like most business people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| And that's how you insure against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| You're going to get sued for too many lawyers out there, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| Well, I got their cross easement, their cross drive and egress and egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| But this connects two public streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| I don't know how you could give them, you could make them a beneficiary of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| which is going to tie them into some liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| I mean, if you can, I'm going to go back and say that if you're going to work, they would have to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| And I would think you would end up in a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| I would then be in favor of postponement if you're going to have to draft an agreement that they would have to agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| They don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Mr. Cappiello is firmly committed to the dedication of this easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4830)|
| 1:20:38| What assurances do we have as the city of Knoxville that we're going to have that easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| And they're going to have the parking lot or the sidewalks and the crosswalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| I mean, that's really going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| He can give you his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| I will work if you approve Councilman Grieve's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| I will work on the assurances between now and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| Right now, you have his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| He's been talking about this for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| I think every development he has done, he has performed all of his obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| and then some without legal obligations to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| But I can certainly work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| And I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| And I think, like Charles Swanson said, we have the second reading to get more comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| And it's a tough call, but I'm in support of closing Ben Ashley Road for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4882)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| My only question about the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| What would the postponement accomplish at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| Both of you all have met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| I think Mr. King wanted to discuss with his people further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| but I'm not sure what a postponement would accomplish at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| I don't know who to address that to, I guess, other than Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4914)|
| 1:22:08| What I just said is where that's one boundary connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4928)|
| 1:22:15| So this is the other boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4935)|
| 1:22:30| My suggestion is that there is no sense in closing Ben Ashley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| There was a discussion in the City of New Jersey about permitting bags and parcels on those nine sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4956)|
| 1:22:47| I believe City of New Jersey would say they can find places for permitting that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4967)|
| 1:22:55| On the other side of the city where we've got bags and parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| and the other side of the city on this side of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| I believe the City of New Jersey would listen to the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4987)|
| 1:23:14| and say a fair amount of parcels would go on that side of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| You get all the parcels that he needs or is required to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| and you haven't closed the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| That's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| I get a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| The proposal which they gave us or discussed back in April doesn't have this on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5013)|
| 1:23:40| It doesn't even have this on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| It has two access to the King site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| It has this access and this access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| The plan was the same date as this plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| which I received yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| It was the same date as November of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| Obviously, someone had asked for yesterday's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5044)|
| 1:24:13| When they said they proposed or suggested a easement at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5053)|
| 1:24:23| it was about that much discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Everybody discards it as not being practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| The practical plan isn't showing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| As I said, I believe there's a case in the nut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| that you don't have to close the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| and you have to seal up a few parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| Can that do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| Is this supposed to be a gravel road or a forest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| I'll hop to another bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| It's no different than the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| This is a walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| Look at this belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| Anywhere anybody walks from one shop to the other is going to be in that hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| or over here on the other side of the belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| Everything in between is parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| I'm going to be real honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| I'm extremely disappointed tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| that there wasn't some kind of an agreement with the two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| When we left here two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| and the suggestion was that the two sides get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| I really expected to come back with something that was an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| I think I've talked to both attorneys more than once and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| have we all hugged and said this is great and are we moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| And I keep getting the answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| I'm disturbed about a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| And one of them has to do, as this development was getting underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| that there were missteps from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| that counsel is now being asked to redirect or straighten out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| So I would not support, I don't think, a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| because I'm pretty convinced from the e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| and having talked with attorneys on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| that there's not going to be a compromise that would be agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| And I could not support a postponement if that comes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Vice Mayor Pablos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| Mr. Seymour, I'd like just your thoughts on Mr. King's parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5193)|
| 1:26:41| or Mr. Cappiello, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| May I turn that over to Mr. Cappiello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| I am an attorney, not a real estate developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5206)|
| 1:26:53| As I understand it, what he's proposing to go to parallel parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| causes a couple of different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| For every two spaces that are perpendicular to the road, I can get one parallel space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5221)|
| 1:27:07| Second of all, in my understanding and research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| and I don't mean any disrespect whatsoever, but this is a woman's store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| Women do not like parallel parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| I've had that told to me by retailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5238)|
| 1:27:27| Anyway, I am trying to create consensus and a uniform development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5247)|
| 1:27:34| and that is why I'm asking for the road to be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| I'm sorry if that statement offended someone, but it's just men don't like it either, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5257)|
| 1:27:47| Mayor, if I can interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Go right ahead, Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| We looked at that, and basically it goes from 21 spaces down to 11 spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| if you create the parallel parking on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| I think that's what we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| So what would we be short parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Eleven spots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| Eleven spots, and then depending on how you egress and ingress the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| according to what they showed me the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| The maps said 110 were required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| Are you saying there's less than 110?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| They said they had 120 showing, but they had 110 as a requirement on their chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5309)|
| 1:28:40| One hundred and ten spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| I'm looking at the foldout, AS3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| One hundred and ten spaces required, 120 provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| So we had ten extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| If you lose 11, you're one short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| you ought to be able to kiss up to the engineering department to get an exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| That's not how decisions are made, just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| You just had a rational argument why there should be less, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| A little humor, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| George's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| If I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| Are you responding to the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| What I was speaking, hey, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| You really need to speak into the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| There's a world out there that's listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| Now I have to hold it over here, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5366)|
| 1:29:44| What I was suggesting was that you leave the nine diagonal parking spaces along the street on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5384)|
| 1:29:59| and use your parallel parking on the other side where you have 12 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| You would then get six parallel parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| Leave the nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| You still are over the required parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| That wouldn't involve closing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| Now, I don't know whether city engineering would go along with that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| I'd like to discuss it with them and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| From day one, we've asked them to come to us with a proposal that did not include closing Ben Ashley Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| that we would work with them any way we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| Let's take a look at that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| It's never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| And once again, as of yesterday, I'm told this is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| This is our compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| I believe there's a way to do this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| It's laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| I believe it can be done with the street there just as easily as we can do it by creating an easement and closing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5455)|
| 1:31:04| I'd like to see that pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| I'd like to have that opportunity to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| And since it's not on the table, again, I would ask that you vote no on the motion to close Ben Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5468)|
| 1:31:19| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| Mayor, first of all, Brenda, I apologize for not coming back with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| But I firmly believe that when I was told by some of the folks at Southern Markets, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| we'll do anything but close that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| And then I hear from the developer side, we'll do anything, but we've got to close the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| So, I mean, we do have a stalemate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| I do think that, you know, we talk about they're talking about that we're giving a piece of property to a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5505)|
| 1:31:52| to enhance the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| But we also, we as a group, have given TIFs and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| We've helped the city in a number of different ways to develop properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| And so I don't see that much difference here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| I think that what we need to do is we need to get out of the emotional aspect of what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| and look to see that there are areas in Bearden that are becoming developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| They're becoming nicer than what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| We're taking old, run-down buildings and motels and converting those into a much nicer spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| We've got to start someplace to make Bearden walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| This developer is willing to take a whole side of Homburg and put a sidewalk in, and that's a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| Now, granted, we don't have sidewalks behind Bennett's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| and we don't have sidewalks behind some other parking lots up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| but maybe that's something that we as a city can look at to help Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| But we have a developer who's willing not only to add those sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| but we talked to him about there may be some repair of sidewalks on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| I think one thing, and I asked the legal counsel, if we pass this on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| can we instruct the developer to maybe also not only talk with those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| but can we also instruct him to make sure that what he's talking about is done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| You can instruct him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| It won't be part of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| But he can come back to us on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| If we pass it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| Maybe we have the opportunity also for the two groups to get together during this time, you know, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5605)|
| 1:33:32| And you can definitely change your vote between first and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| There are places in the city where this situation exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| where you have a private road that essentially dissects a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| I would say, using my own self as an example, I would say that the difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| the way vehicular traffic would approach that as a road would be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| than as a driver would approach it through a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| Through a parking lot, you can have speed bumps that you can't have on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| When you see a yellow line down the middle of it, when you see the delineation where it's not the same pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| it would cause people to not regard it as a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| They'll regard it as a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| And I don't think it's not the best for creating the walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| Visually, it will look the same in regards to being able to drive back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| But I can tell you that I think in order to create the best long-term for the benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| I still think it's the best thing to making it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| Well, just to be clear, what I was talking about, walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| is I'm referring to his sidewalks that he's adding on Homburg to be able to tie the whole Homburg area together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| But at Central Baptist Church, you have this same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| And that road, I mean, it's got a double yellow line down through the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| And I'd travel that road faster than I would if it was in a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| And I think that's not for safety, you know, to have it as a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| Baker is a big difference between what he's compromised, and he didn't have to offer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| This is a pretty big compromise for him to offer that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| So it is a compromise, and the sidewalks is certainly a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| But there's a big difference between being a road and how he can deal with it in his easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| And I think it's a safer situation, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| And I think if you look at the drawings, you can still see that you do have that visibility from Kingston Pike to their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| Visibility corridor is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| So on the table, we have a motion to approve the appeal and pass the ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| Are you all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| I'm going to ask for a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| Councilman Stairs abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5772)|
| 1:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| The motion, it's a five yes, three no, and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| So the motion does pass, and this moves on then to second reading, which will be in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5784)|
| 1:36:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Thank you all who were here and participated in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| We are now on to 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| 11A, a resolution to honor the memory of Jimmy Thacker Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| and to express council's condolences to his family upon the occasion of his passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5807)|
| 1:36:59| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| I just wanted to add that I would like to add my name to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| Maybe the others would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| I didn't have an opportunity, or at least I didn't observe an opportunity to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| and I certainly think it's a great thing that we're going to honor Mr. Thacker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| So I'd like to join the motion as a sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| We will add your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| I wanted to, if it's all right with council, to read some of the highlights of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5842)|
| 1:37:28| I did attend the funeral and gave some remarks on behalf of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5848)|
| 1:37:35| and his widow asked if we had anything prepared, which we did not at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| But I would like to read a few highlights of this resolution if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| Go right ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| Whereas Mr. Jimmy Thacker passed away on April 30, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| whereas Mr. Thacker was a graduate of Allen University and received his Bachelor of Science degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| and whereas Mr. Thacker further obtained a Master's of Science Administration at Atlanta University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5879)|
| 1:38:06| and whereas Mr. Thacker spent almost half a century in the education profession as a teacher, coach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5886)|
| 1:38:15| professor, and administrator, including serving as principal at Austin East High School from 1971 to 81,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5895)|
| 1:38:26| and whereas Mr. Thacker also was a generous donor of his time with various organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5906)|
| 1:38:33| whereas Mr. Thacker will be deeply missed by the members of his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| as well as the thousands of people he touched through his long and influential life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| And I would like to add on my own that certainly Mr. Thacker had a great influence on this community as an educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5924)|
| 1:38:53| and I don't see any members of his family here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| I don't think any of them were here, but maybe they may be watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| And we will send the resolution to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| I also want to add, he's also a great neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| He and Brenda were neighbors of mine when I lived in the River Shore subdivision for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| So, Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| Yeah, I, too, would like to be added to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| I apparently did not include myself and certainly want to be a part of that acknowledgement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| So all of Council will be included on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| Item 11B, a resolution respectfully requesting, pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated 13.3.304.B.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5972)|
| 1:39:39| the Metropolitan Planning Commission to consider and make a recommendation to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| regarding the possible change to the zoning classification of the two parcels located at the north side of Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5984)|
| 1:39:52| on the east side of Francis Road, and further known as 106KB02602 and 106KB02603,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=5992)|
| 1:40:02| located in the City of Knoxville to Neighborhood Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| and to the extent required, amending the one-year comprehensive development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| and zoning plan for the City of Knoxville to amend the classification of all city property, if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6011)|
| 1:40:19| Requested by Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| We have two speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Would you like to hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| We have Mr. Seymour and Mr. Hugh Holt, and we're going to try and get back to the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6025)|
| 1:40:34| Very, very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| Actually, we would request on behalf of Knox County that this be amended to delete the second parcel from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6044)|
| 1:40:55| and leave that as office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| That's the parcel people refer to as the old house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| It's parcel 02603.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| Knox County has declared this property surplus, wishes to auction it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| The first parcel, 02602, is at the corner of Francis and Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6071)|
| 1:41:20| Knox County will sell that property at public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| It has four users already who are interested in that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| and that is before any public interest has been expressed in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| We respectfully request that City Council send that parcel back to MPC for study on an amendment to the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6096)|
| 1:41:45| and the zoning on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| Is that all you have, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| We also have Mr. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Mr. Holt is the Purchasing Director for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| Mr. Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Hugh Holt, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| I just got on the list to be here in case any of the council members had any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| but obviously I work for Mayor Burgett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| He didn't want to come himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| He's busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| These two parcels of property are adjacent to Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| Directly on one corner is a Delta Express that was a shell three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| Across the street from this property is Middlebrook United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| and then diagonally is a piece of property that is in some state of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| but it's my understanding that it is about to be developed into a retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6163)|
| 1:42:49| The larger parcel that we're asking MPC to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| has been a piece of property that's been in somewhat dispute about who really owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6174)|
| 1:43:01| Because it's adjacent to Bearden Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| the folks at Bearden Middle School and the school district thought they owned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| But when the records were checked, that was county land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| During the ten years that I've been looking at that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| it's primarily been used for people to put illegal signs advertising their soccer league| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| or some other kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| So, to me, this would be an improvement to have something on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| Or a political campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| No, there were not political signs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| Certainly not mine, because I have a real pet peeve about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| But back to this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| There were signs posted by MPC when this was first considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| and proposed by the county several weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| But apparently they were well displayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| because I have chastised MPC for hiding those signs in the weeds at the back of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| But these were very prominent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| But apparently the folks at Bearden Middle were not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| They contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| I think they contacted some other council members this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| about 4 o'clock when they had this realization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| So I'm going to ask that we separate the two out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| that we take the 106KB02602, which is the bigger parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| and that's the one that we want to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| And we would ask that they then zone this neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6263)|
| 1:44:31| And then the piece that's 106KB02603, say, office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| that's the one that has the former Florence Crittenden home on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| It's a historic site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| I think it's in pretty good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| And that has great potential as an office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| I'm going to ask the law director to state that motion the way he would like to see it stated to achieve your goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| If I'm understanding this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| I think the appropriate motion here would be to amend this resolution to delete from this motion parcel 106KB02603,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6297)|
| 1:45:11| because you don't want that to go back to MPC and leave in the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| So your motion is to amend to delete that particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| And which one is that, again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| That's the one with the big house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| That's the one with the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| And so deleting it would mean that the next one would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| Later on we'll look at it and it will be zoned office, which is the appropriate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| And not this neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| The corner lot that is the bigger of the two pieces of property is the one that would be zoned neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| That's what MPC recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| No, MPC did not recommend neighborhood commercial for that larger piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| They recommended office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| What was their reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| Mr. Donaldson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| Mr. Donaldson, would you like to answer that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| I'd like to answer several questions here and perhaps offer a recommendation on the proper wording of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6366)|
| 1:46:13| assuming that you don't follow the Planning Commission's recommendation later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| You already have a recommendation regarding the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| and the Planning Commission did consider NC1 for that corner parcel, so there's no need to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6382)|
| 1:46:29| You already have a recommendation from the Planning Commission on the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| and the Planning Commission considered neighborhood commercial for the corner parcel on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| so you don't need another recommendation from the Planning Commission there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| What you do need is to initiate your own plan amendment request to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6404)|
| 1:46:53| presuming that that's what you end up voting for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| because state law requires that the Planning Commission adopt the change to the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6417)|
| 1:47:06| They have done that, and then the vote by the council is to approve and make it operable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| In the event that you don't want to do that, you then have the opportunity to initiate your own plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6432)|
| 1:47:19| by sending a resolution back to the Planning Commission to consider your proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6439)|
| 1:47:26| They will do that and send it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| Then you can act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Now we're all in the woods, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| Should you decide to do something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| all you have to do is initiate a sector plan amendment for the corner parcel to neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6455)|
| 1:47:45| because you already have a recommendation on the zoning, a recommendation on the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6465)|
| 1:47:52| Planning Commission considered NC1 on the zoning, neighborhood commercial on the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6472)|
| 1:48:02| So you've had the recommendation for those two actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| Let me see if I can get this straight and if you and I can agree on the appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6487)|
| 1:48:15| Assuming they want the corner lot to be C1 or C something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| and assuming they're okay with office as recommended by MPC on the other lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6501)|
| 1:48:28| then we could handle that later on in this agenda simply by allowing the one to go through as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6508)|
| 1:48:38| and dividing it up and making the corner lot C1, if that's what they choose to have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| and just go ahead and pass that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| And then we could amend this resolution right here to say we're asking MPC to initiate a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6526)|
| 1:48:54| for the corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| That won't work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| You as city council have the authority to initiate your own plan amendment to the general plan, which is your sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6540)|
| 1:49:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| Isn't that 12J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| Or L?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| 12L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| 12L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| I can't figure out the difference between this and 12L, M and N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| I mean, we're rezoning in one and then we're rezoning again by changing first the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| then the one-year plan, and then the rezoning to 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| Well, one is the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| The ordinance is to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| The other is this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| What you need to do with the resolution is initiate your own plan amendment to neighborhood commercial for the corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6578)|
| 1:49:48| The planning commission will consider that and make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| and send it back to you in accordance with state law, and then you can act in any way that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| But is that not accomplished by TCA 13-3-304B2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6597)|
| 1:50:05| I don't know what that reference is without the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| I think we need a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| You cannot act to rezone the property until it's consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6610)|
| 1:50:17| So you have to hold off the actions on the corner property until the sector plan is amended to read neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6617)|
| 1:50:26| But you can act on the second lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| Can we move 12L, M, and N up so that we do that first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| I mean, that's yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| Well, here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| You can go ahead and for the one that's not the corner lot that they zoned office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6641)|
| 1:50:48| you can go ahead and get that rezoning done and out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| But I think under the law, if you want that corner lot to be C-1, you're not going to be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6653)|
| 1:51:01| until the sector plan gets changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| And there's no vehicle in this current agenda for changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| Is that right, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| So what you need to do, if this is what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| what you need to do is just amend this corner one out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6678)|
| 1:51:25| You don't really need this at all, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| You don't need this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| What you need to do is take the non-corner lot that you're going to zone office, deal with it separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| go ahead and deal with it tonight, and postpone the part that you take out, which is the corner lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| and defer that until you can get a sector plan amendment to come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Mayor, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| If I could, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| Mr. Holt is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| And, obviously, this was put on the agenda for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| And I'm wondering what your timetable is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| And I know that Mayor Burchett is trying to sell properties to pay bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| So where are we on that if we postpone part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| That's what I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| We would be okay for a postponement of no more than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| So you're still within the time frame that you have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| That can't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| It can't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| What's the time frame, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| State law requires a 30-day public notice for any amendment to the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| So we wouldn't be able to get it on our agenda until July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| Which is the new fiscal year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| What say you, Mr. Holt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| We're okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| You can live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| July, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| Can you answer one other question while you're at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| The phone calls I got were a concern that commercial might put a lot of traffic where kids are moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| walking, that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| Have you all addressed that some way in the way you've looked at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| Let me begin by saying we haven't gotten any calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| And that includes the mayor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| And we've had no contact from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| And Doug Harris is a school board member in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| And neither myself, the finance director, or the mayor has heard from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| In fact, this is the first time I've heard any issues about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| But there is quite a lot of traffic at Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| I think we're back to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| While addressing the traffic issue, one of the exits from the school property crosses Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| There's a crossing guard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| The other exit from the school property is on Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| The speed limit on Francis Road is 15 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| The speed limit on Middlebrook Pike is 20 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| But there is a crossing guard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| And that exit that's used by most of the kids who are within that parent walk zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6833)|
| 1:54:00| they go through, I guess, what would be called the back piece of the property on to Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| They cross Middlebrook Pike now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| There aren't very many kids who cross Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| And this property is on the corner of Francis and Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6849)|
| 1:54:16| We're back to what Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| We chop out the piece and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| So, who has to you state that motion, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| Or what action do we need to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| Let me ask Mr. Donaldson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| Mr. Donaldson, what's the appropriate vehicle for city council to initiate the change to the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6872)|
| 1:54:41| The best vehicle would be a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| This resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Yes, that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| I'll be completely rewriting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| Well, it would be extracting all of the stuff that you don't need out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6896)|
| 1:54:57| So, the proper motion then is to amend this resolution to make it a resolution in support of amending the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6897)|
| 1:55:07| to make the corner lot neighborhood commercially zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6907)|
| 1:55:15| Well, in the plan we use land use classification, not zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| Give me the right word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| You want to initiate an amendment to the land use plan to designate this corner lot as neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6922)|
| 1:55:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| We need a motion to amend this resolution to do that for this corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6936)|
| 1:55:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| Are we clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| We have a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| Anybody want to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6949)|
| 1:55:50| We have two attorneys up here and a planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| The resolution is just asking them to go look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| The resolution is just asking them to go look at it, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| And, first, this is the motion to amend, so then we pass that, then we go back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| I do know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| So, we're going to vote on the amendment, the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| We got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| And now we go to the original motion or original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6980)|
| 1:56:31| I think that's why we have your attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| Well, the way it's going to read is that city council respectfully or city council hereby initiates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=6993)|
| 1:56:43| by this resolution, an amendment to the parcel of property 106 KB 02602 in order to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7003)|
| 1:56:55| whatever the proper designation is for neighborhood commercial zoning, whatever the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7015)|
| 1:57:01| Neighborhood commercial land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Neighborhood commercial land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| Yes, this is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| You're going to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| I'm moving to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| And that is passed as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| We have a short liquor break to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7053)|

| 1:59:13| Yes, I see that Mr. Wessel is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| The thing that was missing from this thing was it didn't say how much this intersection control was going to cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7156)|
| 1:59:25| It just said we'll enter into an agreement with the state that will allow us to build it at our expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| What are we getting into here is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| Just the $1.5 million that happened several months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| This will be part of the development agreement, which you'll see come forward as a part of that installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| But that's the $1.5 million that was added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| That will be a portion of that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| As we allocate the cost of that $1.5 million, this will most likely be a cost within that $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| We're working on the agreement at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| And you don't know the cost of the actual improvement itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| I think most intersections are in the $150,000 category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| How's that right, Mr. Hagman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| Is that general range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7205)|

| 2:05:51| There are no benches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| There are no shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| I would urge that you disapprove of this, vote it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7555)|
| 2:06:02| simply because unless you have a substitution resolution that comes about where the shelters are dismantled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7562)|
| 2:06:14| and then re-situated in those areas, and I can give you ten locations right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| just on the routes that I frequent, where they could be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| One, actually, is the L.T. Ross Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| There's a bench there, but no shelter, and that area is used by all types of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7588)|
| 2:06:36| and it's daily used, heavily used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| The location, bus stop at where there is no bench and no shelter, at MLK on the 33 route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7599)|
| 2:06:47| MLK and at Eternal Life Church, open, just an open area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| And another location would be at McConnell and Bethel, Eastport Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7612)|
| 2:07:00| Those are places where shelters could definitely be put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| If there are plans that KTA has made or they're in the making, in the works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| for shelters to be added into these areas where the need is obvious, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7628)|
| 2:07:14| I understand that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| But, you know, in the process of having it explained to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| I was told that these shelters have been zeroed out in terms of the accounting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| that they have no use technically on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| but I've frequented on the university at least five of those shelters, and they are strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| There's nothing wrong with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Whatever cost, in the resolution it was stated that they were purchased with grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7661)|
| 2:07:46| So, you know, take those resources that, you know, you already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| and put them where they could be well used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| And, again, in my area, in my district, they definitely could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| Thank you, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| Now, Mr. Hubert Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| Hubert Smith, Peel Box 2323 Knoxville, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| First, I'm hopeful that for those individuals who have sat through this very important meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| that you all will give them some leniency and at least allow them to make some remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| But just in case you don't, I want to recognize Emojie Abdullah-Hodd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| He has sat through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| Mr. Roach, who just spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| Jim Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| Mr. Anthony Hancock, our own All-American, is here to support a no vote on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7710)|
| 2:08:37| None of these persons are here on my accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| They're here on their own because they believe in the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| I had no idea what they were going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| They're here on their own because it is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| I will say, though, I think it is the first time I have addressed this body since some of you were elected mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7727)|
| 2:08:52| and four members of council back in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| I'm hopeful that for those of you, five, who are out there campaigning, going through the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7736)|
| 2:09:02| can take this issue and say that you supported it by voting no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| and supported improving the conditions for people who ride public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| Now, I looked around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| I don't know everybody's lifestyle, but I would wager there are not ten people in this room who use public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7751)|
| 2:09:17| But there are thousands and thousands of the citizens that you represent who do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| You were kind enough to appoint me to the Knoxville Transit Authority in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| So I'm here totally in support of not giving those shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7766)|
| 2:09:32| I will be voting no to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| Certainly, the university can do business with whomever they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| However, we have no obligation to give them those shelters, but we do have a great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| And that's what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| This is about a great need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| Now, you may hear, I don't know what anybody's going to say, but you may hear, well, we don't need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7786)|
| 2:09:52| They have no value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| Well, if they don't, why does the new company want them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| They want them so they won't have to buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| Well, that's their problem, not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| I'm going to be very blunt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| Steel doesn't lose its value in eight years, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| Most of you, if you read your e-mails, I think I sent each of you a photo bucket of about a dozen or so pictures of the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7809)|
| 2:10:17| as they existed on Sunday, May 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| They're in great repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| There's nothing wrong with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| There is no reason that I can see that we should give them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| Now, there may be some reasons that the administration may give you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| such as they may rather their mechanics be doing something else other than replacing shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7830)|
| 2:10:35| However, their mechanics install them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| Our mechanics, I should say, as a member of the KTA board, our mechanics can remove them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7838)|
| 2:10:42| And certainly, if we didn't want to place them somewhere immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| I strongly believe that the city would certainly have somewhere that they could help with a little storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| for a few shelters temporarily until we get them placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| I heard what Elwood said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| He is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| That's just one example of many places around this city where we need shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| Yeah, sure, there may be some in the pipeline, but when is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| We have 10 shelters now that belong to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| We should go and get them and put them in places where they're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| People are standing in the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| As the weather intensifies, people will be standing in the heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| There are places now that have shelters, but they could use more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| because the great thing about it is our service is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| Our ridership is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| And so we need those shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| I would encourage you to vote no on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| Certainly, being here since seven, there are many other things I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| but my mind has changed about 20 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| So I'm hopeful you will allow these other individuals a minute or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| and I'll try not to use all of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7902)|
| 2:11:43| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| Mr. Jennings, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| Jim Jennings, 4004 Tassel Pike, small business owner in the city of Knoxville for 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7908)|
| 2:11:55| and wouldn't be anyplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| What a great country we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| When I was in the 20s, we'd have picket signs outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| But now, as I've gotten older, I'm a child of public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7924)|
| 2:12:10| We didn't own a car, couldn't afford a car and buy public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| I don't mean taxi cab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| We had no money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| So my mother used that her whole life to go to a job and raise three children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7937)|
| 2:12:26| And I have employees that do the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| As a matter of fact, Mr. Smith convinced me if I didn't have to be in and out so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| and I was going from point A to point B staying all day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| I would be there because he never misses an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| And cars break down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| I remember Mayor O'Hara spent a day and made every appointment in a campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| I don't know how she did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| A whole week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| You know, when you get senior citizen, you have to give me a day or two, but never missed an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7974)|
| 2:12:59| So I'm not here to criticize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| I think they've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| This is something that we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| And what concerned me was two things, is sometimes you just, well, it's a grant, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7987)|
| 2:13:17| This mayor is famous for recycling, conserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| So I don't think she'd want to throw anything away or say disregard it off to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8002)|
| 2:13:29| And when we talk about grants, federal money, I'll pay a whole lot more in federal money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8009)|
| 2:13:36| than I do the small city property taxes and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| So these buses are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| And I drive by every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| And when you're raised on the lower end of the economic situation, it's pretty tough to get where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8027)|
| 2:13:58| You've got to do what you've got to do to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| And this young lady, when I'm going in the morning, she's coming down, and she has some physical liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8044)|
| 2:14:11| And she walks about, it's about a half a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| She's coming down the hill in front of Wallace Memorial Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| And the bus stop is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| And she hides behind that pole in the wintertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| It's 100 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| And when I'm going home and coming down, she's walking up that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8065)|
| 2:14:31| But she's going to a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| And I hear all the time, well, these people need to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| Well, to have a job, you've got to have a way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| And that's what public transportation is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| Now, I follow my mom when I see her doing that and the sacrifices she made to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8084)|
| 2:14:52| So I've sat here for two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| It's a bad night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| And these are important issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| But we're talking $500,000 here and two opposing sides battling for position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8098)|
| 2:15:09| And I've come here tonight to speak for the people that probably would be intimidated to come here, a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8109)|
| 2:15:19| But do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| Take these things apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| If they charge $1,500 to install these, I need to start bidding on some of these CAT contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8124)|
| 2:15:30| because that's an unreasonable amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8130)|
| 2:15:35| And I'll close with this one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| I'm in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| I've lost some bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| I buy all this tooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| And I get undercut on the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| And I don't say and use that tooling for other customers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| And I don't say, well, here, you take this tooling, I'll buy me some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8152)|
| 2:15:57| That's just not good business sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| Sometimes these things are so routine that you look past them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| It's 9 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| These people need these shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| I defy anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Some of the days we had this winter to stand out, even 15 minutes waiting on the bus, it's a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8169)|
| 2:16:16| So don't pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| Let's use those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Let's put them, find the spots that need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| And they've got mechanics over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| Oh, you're kicking me out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| I know it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| But just do the right thing by people that don't say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| And I appreciate the cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| I appreciate what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| We're not doing this for UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| UT can demand that new contractor that took that $400,000 from us and tell them to put some up over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8199)|
| 2:16:46| If they don't want to do it, we'll sell them ours and we'll buy some new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| Thank you, Mr. Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| Oh, before I sit down and I'm going to take 10 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| I'm on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I want to remind everybody that the right that we have to come here, our men and women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8219)|
| 2:17:05| are all over this world defending the freedoms we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| And these wars have gone on so long that we tend to forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8229)|
| 2:17:16| We just do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| But all of us probably have got relatives that have been three or four times to Afghanistan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8237)|
| 2:17:24| So keep them in your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| And don't forget our military people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| Thank you, Mr. Jennings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| Counselor, there's another individual that has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| So I need a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| Move to suspend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| And one additional five minutes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8265)|
| 2:17:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| Mr. Umoja Abdul-Ahad, thank you for also being here for two hours and 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8267)|
| 2:17:54| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| Yes, my name is Umoja Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| I live at 614 West Hill Avenue, Suite 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| And I wouldn't want to be any place in the world but here with these lovely faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8284)|
| 2:18:10| I mean, I could do more than what has already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| I mean, it's very important that we not just take these 10 shelters and then give them away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8293)|
| 2:18:19| that we utilize them in ways that are beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| I walk about 10 miles a day, various areas throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8302)|
| 2:18:28| You may see me in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| You may see me in the North City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| But we don't need to put the shelters in the North City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| We need to be sure to put them in Fountain City and South Knoxville and East Knoxville and West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8315)|
| 2:18:41| For sure, our city is moving toward being the recycled capital of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| Our mayor is very sincere about green and serious about sustainability and recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8326)|
| 2:18:52| And this is a good effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| This is a good way to show that we're sincere about what we say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| These shelters do not need to be left at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8338)|
| 2:19:04| They need to be deassembled, put in a place where they can be put up rapidly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| so people can see the benefit of how our city works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| And just as was said earlier, there will be a lot of citizens who watch this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| who would like to probably come and make the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| A very older lady would say, well, I walk to work or I walk down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| In the wintertime when it's 32 degrees, I get cold, but I still have to do what I have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| So us to put a shelter for our community, for the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| to take these shelters and put them where they need to be would be something that would be profound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| It would show that we are really great stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| We're definitely looking at how we can utilize things that are used in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| such as these shelters, how we can be sure contractually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| that in the future people will even think about it in the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| Why do we not either purchase 10 shelters when we make a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| and subtract or either use these shelters that I'm going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8400)|
| 2:20:07| instead of taking some shelters, you know, under this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| So I state once again, as I said, let's take these shelters, let's vote unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8411)|
| 2:20:17| I think it should be an unanimous vote, not just a partial vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| I don't think it should be 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| I don't think it should be 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| I think it should be unanimous, nine city council people voting that these shelters be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| for the citizens in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| Thank you, Mr. Abdullahab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| Okay, council, those are all of the folks who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8439)|
| 2:20:40| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| Could we hear from Cindy McGinnis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| Yes, Ms. McGinnis, come down and address the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8443)|
| 2:20:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8449)|
| 2:20:50| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| I'm Cindy McGinnis, 301 Church Avenue, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| First of all, it's great to hear the outpouring of support for CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| and for public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| And I think somehow the issue has gotten a little emotional here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| so I'd like to explain some of the business decision behind the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| that we did make to the Knoxville Transportation Authority at its meeting on April 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| The KTA did hear this matter, and the KTA did approve to recommend to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| that the ownership of these shelters be transferred to the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8477)|
| 2:21:23| First of all, we're not really giving away the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| The UT and the city of Knoxville have been in a longstanding arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| and agreement for supporting public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| UT has been a significant stakeholder in CAT for over the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8494)|
| 2:21:39| They have been paying significantly for the support of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| One could argue that they perhaps even provided the financing for the local share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| that bought the shelters in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| Secondly, I'd like you to realize that the shelters aren't going to be unused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| They will still be on the University of Tennessee campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| And we do have other routes that serve apartment complexes that serve UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| Theoretically, there still could be some CAT passengers using the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8520)|
| 2:22:07| The design of the shelter is very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| There are two different designs of the shelters in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| One is a smaller design that doesn't have any back to it, nor does it have a bench in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8533)|
| 2:22:18| In order to place a bench and a back into the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| might require some additional engineering costs on the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| which would probably be more than the shelter is worth in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| So the shelters wouldn't really be easily able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| you wouldn't be able to easily pick them up and plop them down somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| without a significant amount of work unless you just want an overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| But most of our passengers want benches and a back to the bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| so they don't fall off the back of the shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| These shelters were primarily designed for people walking quickly through the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| and expecting a bus to be there pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| People on UT campus don't usually have to wait very long for a bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| because the service frequencies are so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| And a couple of the shelters are actually just very large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| and it would be problematic to place them somewhere else in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| The design of the shelter isn't consistent with our current shelter design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| The current shelter design, if you've seen the shelters at Walbrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| that's more in keeping with the shelters that we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| There's also a shelter on Hill Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| It's a much techier look than this design that was selected by UT probably 8 to 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8597)|
| 2:23:23| and it's more in keeping with the designs that you see around campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| We do anticipate that it would probably cost about $1,500 a shelter to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8606)|
| 2:23:32| And once it's removed, it has to be transported over to the CAT property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8612)|
| 2:23:36| and sandwiched in somewhere with the hopes that it won't get damaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| before we can find a place to erect it somewhere else throughout the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8619)|
| 2:23:44| Additionally, it's very problematic to install shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| It's not as simple as pouring a concrete pad and buying a shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8627)|
| 2:23:51| and bolting it to the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| There are right-of-way issues, there are easement issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8633)|
| 2:23:56| It takes months from the time you decide a shelter is going to go somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| until it actually gets somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| And I know several of you are working with me on the Virginia College shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| and that's been taking several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| It's not an easy process to get these shelters out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| so it's not like we can pick them up tomorrow and move them somewhere else that same day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8650)|
| 2:24:15| and erect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| It's not as simple a process as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| And I think those are the notes I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| If you have unanswered questions, I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| Sandy, what does a new shelter cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| Depending on the size of the shelter, a basic shelter is $4,000 to $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8672)|
| 2:24:38| Was there any consideration given to selling those to UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| UT requested that we just transfer the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| It would relieve us of maintenance and liability issues on the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| Plus, the shelters are past their useful life as far as depreciation is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8690)|
| 2:24:57| And UT is a very good partner of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| We look forward to them continuing to financially support the Voltrelli line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| and to also allow us to assist them with some transportation needs during football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| So we're not really looking to financially gain from this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| as much as we are trying to accommodate a request from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| So we definitely could ask them to financially participate in transferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| But you didn't today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| We did not because that was not their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| Councilman Del Vecchio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| I was trying to figure out if we tried to sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| I mean, I don't know why they wouldn't want to buy them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| or their contractor would not want to buy them, maybe for a very knockdown price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8732)|
| 2:25:36| But as I understand depreciation, that's how you write it off on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| and claim tax advantages, but it doesn't necessarily reflect actual life in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| And so I'm hearing people say, and I saw pictures that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| there's some healthiness to these shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8751)|
| 2:25:52| They're a different design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8752)|
| 2:25:53| You've got to have a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| No, they're very well maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| There's nothing wrong with the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8755)|
| 2:25:56| But we, as I said, we were just trying to accommodate a request from a stakeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8756)|
| 2:26:00| What about asking the contractor to buy them from you or rent them from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| or whatever he wants to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| I mean, have you thought about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| You think that's bad form with UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| I mean, that's what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| We're kind of schmoozing UT to get some of their other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| and we're going to throw a few shelters at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| That's what I'm picking up, and I'm overstating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| But they have value, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| I mean, they have value in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| Yes, they have value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| So can we try that, or do you think that's not proper activity on CATS part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| We'll do whatever you instruct me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| Well, this is a system that we put about $11 million a year in because it doesn't pay its own way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8791)|
| 2:26:36| and now we're going to give away shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| I wish we could be a little bit more frugal with even small items like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8802)|
| 2:26:43| Well, I did make the point the University of Tennessee has been a significant financial stakeholder in CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8803)|
| 2:26:47| and it didn't seem at the time that we needed to financially gain from this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8807)|
| 2:26:55| And I'm sure you're hoping to get that contract back when the other guy messes it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8815)|
| 2:26:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| We wish UT the best of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| Let's go to Councilman Brown first since this is in his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8825)|
| 2:27:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| He's on the CAT board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| In my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8834)|
| 2:27:15| Well, I have several questions and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| I watched the CAT board meeting today for the hour and some time that it took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8837)|
| 2:27:24| and there were several points that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| One of the suggestions at that meeting was that this be postponed for 30 days to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8847)|
| 2:27:33| and answer some of the questions that have been asked here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8853)|
| 2:27:37| And that vote was 5-3 to not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| And then there was another vote, and it was voted to send this on to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| But in the course of the discussion, several questions were asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| and Melissa Robertson was there in your place because you were in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| One of the questions that was asked was about the liability for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8873)|
| 2:27:58| These shelters are City of Knoxville assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8881)|
| 2:28:02| And we are giving those to the University of Tennessee to be used by their new transportation provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8882)|
| 2:28:10| But when Ms. Robertson was asked the question about maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| she didn't know or it was not clear who would be responsible for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8895)|
| 2:28:22| In other words, when those shelters are turned over to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| they will never call the city and ask the city to do anything for those shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| You mean UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8910)|
| 2:28:31| UT, I mean, UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| UT will never ask the city to maintain or do anything in regard to those shelters once they're turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8920)|
| 2:28:41| That would be my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| I can't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8923)|
| 2:28:44| No, I'm not asking about assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8924)|
| 2:28:45| Is that part of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| I think the resolution was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| It's not in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| It's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| Well, when you're transferring the ownership of the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| I would assume that you would transfer the liability and the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| But if it needs to be more clearly spelled out, I'm sure a provision can be made to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| Well, I'm not comfortable with assumptions when we're dealing with legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8945)|
| 2:29:10| I have a number of people who ride buses in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| a large part of the third district that has no bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| But as I see people standing on Middlebrook Pike, Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| sometimes on Clinton Highway or Pleasant Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| they are standing in weeds up to their knees in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| There are no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| And it would really be nice if they had a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| I also find out that it takes months or perhaps years to get a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8973)|
| 2:29:38| What kind of time frame, if we needed a shelter, let's say, at Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8978)|
| 2:29:43| and Lakebrook, which would be in mine and Councilman Grieve's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8983)|
| 2:29:48| how long would it take to get a shelter there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| It would really depend on the unique shelter situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| If there is plenty of city right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| and we don't have to obtain property from an owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| that helps the process go a little bit quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| If a sidewalk is in good shape along that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9003)|
| 2:30:06| They don't have any sidewalks there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9006)|
| 2:30:07| Well, we've been meeting with city engineering on working with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| on even helping develop a priority sidewalk listing with transit in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9011)|
| 2:30:18| And we're having those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| Within CAT, you don't have a time frame that say, typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9022)|
| 2:30:26| it takes six months from beginning to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| It takes nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| It takes five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| You don't have a time frame within the CAT structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| Each shelter site is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| It's like building a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| I mean, you can run into certain problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| Sometimes the site has to have utilities relocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| and then you rely on KUV or AT&T or whomever when they get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9044)|
| 2:30:51| It's like a street project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| And it's always amazing to me how complicated it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| But there's an average time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| I'm sure we could figure out how many shelters we've put in the past five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| and what the time has been from when we started it until when it ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| But you're not going to get a number that's typical for any particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9069)|
| 2:31:10| How many shelters do we have in this city, excluding the 10 on campus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9070)|
| 2:31:13| We have 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| Council, I see Mr. Hare from UT is here and moved into position, it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9077)|
| 2:31:22| in case anybody would like to ask him questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9084)|
| 2:31:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| We have the information we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| It says CAT has grant funds available for future shelter purchase and installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9089)|
| 2:31:36| How much do we have available for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9096)|
| 2:31:40| We have to spend at least 1% of our federal allocation that we get every year on shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9100)|
| 2:31:46| and that works out to be at least $50,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9106)|
| 2:31:49| So we do routinely have these shelter installations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9109)|
| 2:31:54| We did a rather large one last year at Walbrook by the Walbrooks and by the Sims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9114)|
| 2:32:00| and Walmart near Walbrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| and that was a little bit more expensive than a normal shelter installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9122)|
| 2:32:07| So we do have ongoing funds that we use for shelter placements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| Well, I asked at the last board meeting, as the council representative, in my own neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9132)|
| 2:32:19| there on Brooks Road, we had discussed installing a shelter there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| And it was said that the holdup was getting the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| or the easement from the property owner, who I happen to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| That's a good case in point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9155)|
| 2:32:36| There's a cement pad there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| That shelter site is ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| The owner has requested an appraisal for the parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| that he will be turning over to the city for tax purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9165)|
| 2:32:48| and that's where the issue is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| I understand that Mr. Miracle is out on leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| and it's sort of contingent upon his knowledge to get this appraisal conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| So these shelter sites are complex, and that's what's holding that one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9179)|
| 2:33:04| Well, I have great respect for the speakers who have spoken tonight in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9184)|
| 2:33:09| and I understand where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| But what I would like to see is some new shelters placed in the city, especially in the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9191)|
| 2:33:20| We do have shelters there by Walter P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| There's a great need for more shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| But rather than to disassemble these older shelters, we really need to put up some new shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9205)|
| 2:33:33| So as the council representative to CAT, I'm going to support this, as before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9213)|
| 2:33:42| in the hopes that we will have new shelters placed throughout the city where they need to be placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9222)|
| 2:33:49| because I think it's not going to be cost prohibitive to tear these down and move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9229)|
| 2:33:55| At least that's what's said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| Now, I guess in this packet it's saying $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9236)|
| 2:34:01| That's the estimate that you've come up with or CAT has come up with to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9241)|
| 2:34:06| But I would rather see some new shelters in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| So that's where I'm at with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| And I might also add that we do have an amenities coordinator who does give updates to the KTA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9252)|
| 2:34:18| on our amenity program, on our shelter program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| So it's not like we only pay attention to this when it draws a lot of attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| We are consistently reviewing the service area to determine where the next shelter should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9267)|
| 2:34:35| That's the only comment I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9277)|
| 2:34:38| I'd like to hear from Mr. Hare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9278)|
| 2:34:40| Mr. Hare, please state your name and address for the record, and I'd like to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9280)|
| 2:34:48| You've heard the conversation so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| Thank you, Mark Hare, 7904 Bennington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9290)|
| 2:34:55| I also am a big proponent of public transit, both personally and professionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9295)|
| 2:35:03| I think shelters are critically important to support the public transportation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| whether it's CAT's citywide system or the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9307)|
| 2:35:10| And I kind of look at these still connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| June 1st, CAT won't go away from campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| It will change its relationship in the services and programs on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| We will still have special events service, significant amounts of special events service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| There's private off-campus apartments that serve campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| They come directly onto campus and use our amenities and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9328)|
| 2:35:33| The CAT lift service for people with disabilities, these shelters are really critical to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9333)|
| 2:35:38| while they wait for the CAT vehicles that bring them from different parts of the city to and from campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| So I think that's just something to consider, that there's somewhat of a bigger picture here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| and we certainly would support this and understand some of the concerns that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9348)|
| 2:35:55| And as a KTA commissioner, I'm certainly concerned about new shelters getting out as quickly as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9355)|
| 2:36:01| and we'll do everything as a board member to help support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| And I think this has raised the issue and maybe emphasized the need to speed up that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| if it's possible to get shelters out throughout the CAT system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| If you've got specific questions, I'd be glad to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9374)|
| 2:36:17| What's your position? What's your title there at UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| Director of Parking and Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| I don't have a question of him particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| I just, you know, as what I'm hearing, I don't think you're going to have a lot of luck with this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9386)|
| 2:36:33| I want to move that we postpone this for 30 days and let, you know, you've heard the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9393)|
| 2:36:41| and I think there needs to be further conversation between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| And I think that that probably would be the best route to go, excuse the pun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9405)|
| 2:36:53| I'll second your route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9413)|
| 2:36:54| At this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9414)|
| 2:36:55| If I could make a comment on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| Well, I mean, we're going to go to motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9418)|
| 2:37:02| I think I have some relevant information on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9422)|
| 2:37:09| Are you fine with him responding to that part of the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9429)|
| 2:37:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| I think the issue of the changeover over the transit systems and in talking with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9434)|
| 2:37:19| about that issue with our administration today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9439)|
| 2:37:22| they did indicate for liability issues primarily that the shelters would need to be removed by midnight, May 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9442)|
| 2:37:33| So I think that's a time-pressing issue that is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9453)|
| 2:37:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9460)|
| 2:37:41| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9461)|
| 2:37:42| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| Well, he made a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| So we need to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9469)|
| 2:37:50| Does he want to adjust?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9470)|
| 2:37:51| Well, I'm going to have to obviously adjust the, you know, the time frame for, you know, for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9471)|
| 2:37:57| And I know that's going to push it, but so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9477)|
| 2:38:04| I mean, it's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9489)|
| 2:38:10| A question related to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| How much money is UT going to be paying to CAT in terms of the services you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9492)|
| 2:38:20| I mean, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9500)|
| 2:38:21| What's the value of those services that UT will now be giving to CAT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9501)|
| 2:38:27| The special event service depends on the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| We would expect still to do athletic shuttles with the university, so that could certainly range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9510)|
| 2:38:37| But we do a significant amount of business with them and expect to still do business in terms of football shuttles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9517)|
| 2:38:44| and basketball shuttles in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| That could be $50,000 or up in the six figures depending on the level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9527)|
| 2:38:53| What has it been in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| I mean, say last year, for instance, when we had the service, then what was the extra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| I'm not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9539)|
| 2:39:00| What did that pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9540)|
| 2:39:01| The agreement for the campus bus service or special event service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9541)|
| 2:39:05| Special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| You're saying what's the history last year for special events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9547)|
| 2:39:10| Okay, hold on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| That's your question, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9552)|
| 2:39:13| Yeah, that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9553)|
| 2:39:16| I can't quote the exact figure, but it was probably 100 and some thousand total for athletic shuttles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9556)|
| 2:39:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| Back to Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| Well, and I just want to say, I mean, I've heard all the compelling arguments and the stories about people along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9564)|
| 2:39:31| but they're serving people over there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9571)|
| 2:39:34| I mean, let's not look past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9574)|
| 2:39:36| I mean, I understand the financial part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9576)|
| 2:39:40| but I'd like to see if we can't find some common ground on this because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| they're moving people within basically within my district, you know, from the student housing in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9584)|
| 2:39:52| I would assume that's where the route's going to be, would be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| Assuming that, I don't know that, but I'm going to say that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| Fort Sanders, I mean, those are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| They're not, you know, so I want to see if we can just find common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| So there's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| There's a motion and a second to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9610)|
| 2:40:11| Let's see if we have any comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| Well, I'm going to support the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| I guess my concern, I'm a little frustrated tonight, as some of you probably are beginning to guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9617)|
| 2:40:22| because CAT knew and the university knew several months ago that this was an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9622)|
| 2:40:29| and to wait until less than 30 days before these shelters need to be removed to bring it to council is just not good form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9629)|
| 2:40:38| from my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9638)|
| 2:40:39| I'm not speaking for the other eight members of council, but it's not good form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9639)|
| 2:40:43| And it doesn't give us the opportunity to really ask questions or get to the bottom of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9643)|
| 2:40:49| We just have to assume that everything we're being told is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9649)|
| 2:40:53| And typically in the past, I've gotten in trouble with making assumptions on different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9653)|
| 2:40:59| and this is one of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| So I want to support Vice Mayor Pavlis's motion to postpone for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9661)|
| 2:41:07| but I'm not happy with the way this has been handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9667)|
| 2:41:10| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9670)|
| 2:41:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9671)|
| 2:41:12| I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9672)|
| 2:41:13| I would suggest that the UT and the city of Knoxville look for maybe the UT would purchase two additional shelters for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9673)|
| 2:41:23| Keep the ones you got, but buy additional shelters for the city of Knoxville in lieu of picking them up and moving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9683)|
| 2:41:31| A bit of a trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9691)|
| 2:41:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9696)|
| 2:41:37| I'd agree with Councilmember Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| This is quite frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9700)|
| 2:41:41| I think one thing that's frustrating is it seems like it's a battle about if you're for or against shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9701)|
| 2:41:46| I think everybody on this council and the administration, certainly the CAT staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9706)|
| 2:41:51| and the CAT or the KTA board is all in favor of public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| and everybody in this room wants more shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| We all know that it makes it more comfortable and it increases ridership and makes people feel safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9719)|
| 2:42:05| and we are all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| And so it's making us feel like we're voting for or against that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| and it's frustrating me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| I certainly have sympathy for the people opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9732)|
| 2:42:18| It looks like we're giving it to UT, and we're not getting anything back for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9738)|
| 2:42:23| So I see that argument, but the professionals at CAT say that it doesn't make financial sense to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9743)|
| 2:42:30| It's not the way to get the most number of shelters out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| and I certainly see Councilmember Pavlis's comment that the students at UT are citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| A lot of them are citizens of this city and live in this city and are citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9759)|
| 2:42:45| So we're just, I mean, taking shelters for them to put somewhere else if it doesn't make financial sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9765)|
| 2:42:51| And let's not forget that this was voted on by the KTA board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| I believe there's just one vote, Mr. Smith, against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| And all those people are advocates for shelters and for public transportation, and they all voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9779)|
| 2:43:05| So, you know, I guess we're going to postpone it, but, you know, it's a frustrating situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| But I guess I'll support the motion to postpone, but I just thought I'd get those comments out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130514?start=9791)|
