| 0:23:22| Okay, thank you very much. Looks to me like you still need sales tax registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| building fire and health approvals. How have you been doing on getting those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| I'm trying to get them, but right now I just came from out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| so that's what happened. I was in Texas for like two months. I just got back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| Okay. How much time do you think you need to get the rest of those done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1421)|
| 0:23:55| Two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| About two months? So, you think maybe 60 to 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| Just 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Okay. All right. I'll open it up for other members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| Okay. I will. I'll move to extend for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| Okay. I've got a motion to extend for 60 days. I've got a second. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1452)|
| 0:24:19| All right. Hearing none, Mr. Johnson, roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Vice Chair McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Councilman DiBarto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Councilman Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Councilman Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| And Councilwoman Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| All right. Extension for 60 days. All right. That brings us to our next grouping of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| So, we've got item 5D, Allen Jones Aquatic Center, 5E, Good Friend Tennis Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| 5F, Lindsay Nelson Stadium, and 5G, the Sherry Parker Lee Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| Do we have somebody on all four items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| I've enabled Mr. Cheek to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| Thank you, Mr. Johnson. This is Will Cheek. I unfortunately am not in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| but I'm at 920th Avenue South, number 1601, Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Mr. Burr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1525)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you for your name and address, Mr. Cheek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| Looks like most of these, you have fire approvals needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1529)|
| 0:25:36| And, yeah, it looks like it's all fire approvals needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| Now, you have to get the state to do those fire inspections for you. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| That's correct. And once the state signs off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| then Knoxville Fire and Knoxville Building are able to sign off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| We were able to get Sherry Parker Lee Stadium softball and Lindsay Nelson Stadium baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| checked off. And I believe Mr. Burr has cleared us for beer permits to be picked up for those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1561)|
| 0:26:09| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Okay. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| We – and let me just – first of all, let me just apologize for inconveniencing the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| during COVID. The focus of the university and its energy on construction and maintenance has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| for the safety of students during COVID, been very focused on that. And so that has pushed back the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| priority of facilities that are not currently operating. And so these – that's why the delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| with this. We have good friend Anne Allen Jones marked, and we've got a short list of things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1599)|
| 0:26:47| need to be taken care of to appease the state fire marshal. We'd ask that the board give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| another 60 days. And barring something significant, we should be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| All right. Very good. I'll open it up to the other members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1619)|
| 0:27:10| Mr. Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Okay. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| I was just going to say, it sounds like we only need to consider 5D, if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| the Aquatic Center. The others appear to be moved if they're ready to be picked up. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| 5D and E would need to be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Okay. I understood. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| So we're looking at – we got a request for a 60-day extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| for 5D and E, and 5F and G are already complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| I move approval to extend 5D and 5E for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| All right. I've got a motion to extend 5D and 5E for 60 days. I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| Any other discussion? Hearing none, Mr. Johnson, roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1674)|

| 0:28:18| And Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| All right. 60 days for those two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| That brings us to Agenda Item 6, which is Beer Board Administrative Hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| First up is 6A, Knoxville Alehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| Have we got someone from Knoxville Alehouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| We have Mr. Wilson with us. I'm enabling him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| Mr. Wilson, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Yes. Hello. My name is Daniel Wilson representing Carolina Alehouse of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| Can you give us the address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Yes. The address is 9045 Kingston Pike in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| Okay. Just reviewing the record here, it looks like you had a first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| sale to a minor in a two-year period in July of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| You submitted a remedial plan in August of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| Then you had a second citation October the 7th of 2020, the second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1759)|
| 0:29:29| October 12th, you were given notice of the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| And November 10th, you submitted your revised remedial plan and your fine was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1773)|
| 0:29:40| Is that all correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Yes. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Okay. And can you go over with us some of the points in your remedial plan this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| and what you're going to be looking at doing differently from the previous remedial plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Yes, sir. So, I actually was not with the Alehouse when it – in 2019 when that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| So, I was unaware of a previous plan that had been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| But our plan for retraining on our plan is to have our staff go through with the new bar manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1806)|
| 0:30:18| the new bar manager, our alcohol training book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| And we have a whole book that I outlined on our – on the document that I turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| Unfortunately, I'm having a little bit of technology issues right now and trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| pull that up so I can have it in front of me. But the main points are to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| what to look for when IDing a customer, what to look for when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| carding a customer and the guidelines of when a customer needs to be carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| And basically, we've, you know, decided that anybody that looks like they're under the age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| of 50 years old is going to be carded. And in the meantime, we are carding every single person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| that has ordered a drink at the bar. Okay. We've certainly heard of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| establishments that have used like computer programs that help them read the IDs and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1872)|
| 0:31:21| you know, that they have a two-step process where, you know, the server might check an ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| but then also there's somebody at the bar that's doing it as well to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| that something doesn't happen. Or just reminding everybody before the shift begins about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| what your policies are. Were those part of what you were thinking of for your remedial plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| Yes. The part about our shift meetings before each shift is starting has been a major focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| of making sure that we're carding our guests and what to look for on a fake ID and what an actual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| you know, Tennessee ID looks like and trying to compare those against ones that are fake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| We have, I believe, there's a book that I haven't seen yet, but I've been told exists that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| asked for that has a bunch of pictures of what the actual IDs for every state look like. And I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1930)|
| 0:32:19| been trying to get that from our corporate office to have at the bar for our bartenders and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| servers. Okay. I'll open it up for any other members who have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| I have a question. In our packet included with the remedial plan, there is a description of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1950)|
| 0:32:40| happened in 2019, but I do not see any reference to the violation in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1960)|
| 0:32:50| Can we hear more about what happened in 2020 and how the business responded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1970)|
| 0:33:01| Yeah. So, from my understanding, I was actually in training in North Carolina when the incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| happened here in 2020. From my understanding, what happened was a fairly new employee had walked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| ready to start his shift, was not on the clock yet, and was trying to help the bartender who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| was a little bit behind and walked up to the table and ended up serving two underage guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2000)|
| 0:33:30| And in addition to that, the employee did not check either cadet's IDs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| Correct. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Okay. And how did the business respond to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| We actually, the employee was written up, and him and I had a one-on-one face-to-face meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2026)|
| 0:33:56| when I first came into the restaurant and kind of went over the expectations of checking IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| and making sure that he's carding every single person when they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| Was there a reason why the business decided to write up an employee in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| but chose to fire an employee in 2019?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| Unfortunately, that I can't speak to because I was not there in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| and up until recently, I was unaware of the violation in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| But you can say that the current policy is to give the employee a write-up, it's not to fire them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| The current policy, I believe the way it's written in our employee handbook is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| the action could be up to termination. However, we felt that whoever the manager was in the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2077)|
| 0:34:48| at the time felt that it was not necessary to terminate the employee at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| Okay. Those are all my questions. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Okay. Those are all my questions. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you. Any other questions? All right. I'll just remind the beer board that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2102)|
| 0:35:11| we have two options here. We can refer this to a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2111)|
| 0:35:20| or we can take no action, and they will automatically go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| to a suspension revocation hearing if there's another violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2126)|
| 0:35:35| Not hearing any motions or anything, so I think I'll take that as taking no action at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2135)|
| 0:35:45| Point of clarification, if there's another violation for them at any point in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2145)|
| 0:35:53| two years, or what's the window for this? Mr. Frost, can you talk to us about that window?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2153)|
| 0:36:02| Yes, that is, Councilwoman Parker, you are correct. It must be a third violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| within a rolling two-year period. Yeah. Thank you. Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2169)|
| 0:36:18| but it would be two years within the first offense. That is correct. Yes. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2178)|
| 0:36:26| I don't have that in front of me whenever that would be, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| That was in July of 2019. Okay. So, July, that two-year rolling period will end July of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2190)|
| 0:36:40| So, Mr. Wilson, if you have another violation between now and July of 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2200)|
| 0:36:48| then you're automatically going to a revocation suspension hearing. Do you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| Understood. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Okay. All right. I'll move on to our next one, which is 6B, SACER-Senoritas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2215)|
| 0:37:10| Have we got anyone here from SACER-Senoritas? Yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| Okay. Can you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| Yes. My name is Eric Ramos and the address is 6701-625-37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| Okay. Looks like you had a sale to a minor the first in a two-year period in February of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2246)|
| 0:37:35| You we received your remedial plan in March of 2019. Then you had a second offense in a two-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2255)|
| 0:37:43| period in October of 2020. You received notice of hearing on October 12th. We received your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2263)|
| 0:37:53| remedial plan on October 28th, and you paid your fine on October 30th. Does that sound correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| Yes, very much. Okay. Can you tell us about this most recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| violation and what steps you're taking to prevent this from happening in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| Well, the violation occurred by a fairly new employee who wasn't ready to get on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2293)|
| 0:38:24| He just overmoved the ID and sold it to an underage person. With that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| we have contacted Self-Help Express and we're consulting with them. We have all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| who have a violent A, B, C, 7 permit prior to being hired. All employees will take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| carting class on self-shelves. During the training, it will be held at the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| which is 6701 Piston Pike. Employees will have to complete a self-shelf EDU online carting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| and responsibility class annually. The born on date will be posted daily on the POS entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2337)|
| 0:39:06| We will implement the usage of ID reader or scanner. We will require every customer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2346)|
| 0:39:20| comes into our establishment to be carted regardless of age. And all employees will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| be required to document birthdate of each as a certain alcohol. And all employees must receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| a manager's approval for any ID that's underage with underage 21s on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2372)|
| 0:39:40| So, are you, did you say that you're adding one of the computer devices to scan the IDs as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| Yes, sir, we are. Okay. And, you know, what are you doing with regard to the starting of shifts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2387)|
| 0:39:55| Are you talking to folks about, you know, your server compliance plan and the technology you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2395)|
| 0:40:03| employed? Every day prior to the shift, I talk to my employees and I tell them, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| I don't care who works, who walks through those doors, you ID everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| I've talked to them on the day-to-day basis before and after the shift to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| they are checking IDs and they're being thorough about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| Okay. All right. Thank you very much. I'll open it up to other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| One question for clarification. When you say that all team members are required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| document the birthday, how are they documenting the birthday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| So, before they're allowed on the computers to put any alcoholic beverage, the computer will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| ask you for a date of birth and from the date whenever they're taking the order, they'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| to write it down the date of birth. But on the computer, the computer will tell you whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| they're present 21 or not. Okay, gotcha. Perfect. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| All right. Any other questions? Councilperson Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Yeah. And this may be a question for Mr. Coward. I know we've asked this before, but reading the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| report from 2019 in this instance, the staff member read the date wrong. Does Tennessee not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2483)|
| 0:41:34| have now have the red box ID or is that, is it possible at that time in 2019, it wouldn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| had an ID with the red box for underage? Yeah. Tennessee does have the under 21 until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2501)|
| 0:41:52| driver's license and the cadet that we use during that operation did have one of those licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2512)|
| 0:42:02| So, okay. I understand that that can be a mistake. But in terms of like remediation or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2522)|
| 0:42:12| training for staff, is that something that to the gentleman from the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| is that something that you guys talk about is like the design of the ID and how it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| under 21 or it has a red box around it if they're, so that way you're flagged to look at the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2543)|
| 0:42:31| and kind of do a double, triple check? Yeah. Yeah. So, every day before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| coordination starts, I make sure that every employee knows about their under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| There are a lot of people that see that ID even though even after they're 21. So, that's why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| said any ID that has been brought with a 21 strip needs to be filled for a management before we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2566)|
| 0:42:55| allowed to give that green light for that alcohol sale. Okay. So, it needs to be reviewed by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| server. It needs to be reviewed by the manager. If it has any of the red indicators on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| Yeah. It has a red indicator and it needs to be reviewed by a management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| Okay. Also, I'd like to add that the employee that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| opening up this opportunity has been terminated. And that's just a policy that we've implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| since it's occurring. Any other questions? Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| One quick question. Sir, in your March 11th, 2019 remediation action plan, you have a statement here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| that states that in addition to the computer rated, I think that's checked, servers must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| present to the bartender the handwritten check with the customer's date of birth filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| Is that process not currently being utilized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| So, the process that I'm trying to utilize, they just basically bring me the ID so that I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| double check and I can make sure that the alcohol sales are not, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| we're not selling to any other people or persons. So, I'm just directing my team to management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2653)|
| 0:44:26| I didn't quite understand that. I didn't hear that answer. Chair Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| did you hear the answer to that? I was having a little trouble with it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| Could you repeat what you were saying? Yes, of course. I said that the problem that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| having right now is I'm having no more employees. If that's the case to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| the documentation to management, so that way management has to clear anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| would look like an underage sale so that we can prevent this from happening ever again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| So, was it that you take, the server will take anything they have questions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2697)|
| 0:45:08| to a manager to have it checked out, or was it all IDs that are presented or checked twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2708)|
| 0:45:18| Whatever the server has a question about needs to be brought to a manager. Like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| if the ID has a red strip, it needs to be brought back to the management. If the ID is not a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| ID, it needs to be brought to a manager. And that's only if they have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2729)|
| 0:45:38| Okay. Well, sir, in your server compliance, your remediation plan from 2019, that's not what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| stated here. But it sounds to me as if you're saying that what you wrote down is not actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| happening. It's only, they're only doing it if they have a question. And that's not how you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| it stated in the remediation plan. No, it is being brought to management. I do, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| management needs to check all the dates and births. And I just want to prevent this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2760)|
| 0:46:08| So, you are still following the 2019 remediation plan. So, and if that is the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| the server should have written the date of birth on the check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| and shown it to the bartender. And had that been done, the bartender would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| caught that error, we would think. Or did the bartender miss that step as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| No, ma'am. Like I said, the employee was a fairly new employee and she completely missed that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2792)|
| 0:46:44| Okay. So, it sounds as if the process, again, that you turned in as part of your remediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| plan in 2019 is not being followed. I'm doing everything I can to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| that everything that I put on file needs to be done on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2817)|
| 0:47:06| Okay. So, you had two failure points. If you're telling us that you're following this 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| remediation plan that was submitted, then you had two failure points in 2019. And that was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2831)|
| 0:47:20| server failed to write the date of birth on the ticket and the bartender failed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| recognize that and advise the server that they needed to get the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| I did not have a bartender in the family who made the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| Okay. Yeah. And so, I just want to bring to your attention, if you submit a remediation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| to the beer board, you're stating, you're actually telling us that this is what you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| in your process. And it sounds as if that was not the case. And so, I would caution you going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| forward. Please do not submit a remediation plan and say that this is what you're going to do if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| that's not actually what you're capable of doing with your current staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| That is what has been done. Like I said, I didn't have a bartender at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| and the server was a fairly new employee, and she completely missed that step. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| understand what you're saying. Vice Mayor, are you done with your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2900)|
| 0:48:37| Yes. Thank you. Okay. You're welcome. Council President Kida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| Thank you. I'm sorry. I got confused in some of that. Were we talking about the incident that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| happened in 2019 or the incident that happened in 20, that just happened in October, where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| failed to follow the remediation plan from 2019? Exactly. We're talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2938)|
| 0:49:06| remediation plan that was submitted in 2019 that was not followed, which had contributed to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| incident. I just wanted to make sure that he understood that's the one we were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| and not the incident from the original incident in 2019. But I hear you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| All right. Any other questions? All right. Just like in our last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2962)|
| 0:49:34| hearing, we have two options. We can refer for a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| or we can take no action and either rolling two-year period. If there's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| violation, then they'll go directly to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| All right. Seeing no motions, I'll take that as we're going to take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| So, that finishes up that Section 6. So, that's all of our items on the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| Mr. Johnson, is that correct? Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| All right. Well, then, this motion is adjourned, seeing that we have no further business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201117?start=3020)|
