| 0:00:00| We have a we're getting ready to start back. Before we go to zoning we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:19| to have one person that wants to speak to us. They need to leave. Mr. Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=19)|
| 0:00:30| The time is 7.05. You have five minutes. Whenever you start speaking. Is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=30)|
| 0:00:41| working now? Yes, thank you. Well, Mr. Strickland, ladies and gentlemen of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=41)|
| 0:00:45| Commission, I'm Charles Bowers and I live at 7920 Blueberry Road in Powell. Several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=45)|
| 0:00:52| of your neighbors, including a lot of fine folks that came with me tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| have asked me to speak for them. I'm honored by that request and their trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| and I welcome the opportunity to talk to you. Honorable Commissioners, we have a formal request for you. You may not like it. The citizens of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:11| County sent you a message some time ago, but maybe you didn't get all of it. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| told you we wanted no more business as usual. However, we continue to see some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| of the same old stuff. Now, I know a lot of that's out of your hands and you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| do anything about it. Maybe there's something you can do about this. Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| elaborate. Your recent acceptance of the mayor's budget with virtually no change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| signaled pretty much business as usual. It seems that you ignored our request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=93)|
| 0:01:39| and we think you were wrong, respectfully speaking. The document you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| see in my left hand right here is a Shelby County fiscal 0-9 budget. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| document in my right hand is the Knox County fiscal 0-9 budget. They have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| same titles, they have about the same size, but there the similarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| ends. Shelby's documents have clearly presented useful pie charts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| charts of accounts, organization charts, and mission statements. Knox County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:15| does not. Knox County's budget traditionally hides rotten pork, lobster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| lunches, and financial mismanagement, in my opinion. It defines very few accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=141)|
| 0:02:29| We don't know what the accounts are for, what are their missions, how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| money will be spent, or anything. The Shelby version is signed off by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| mayor of Shelby County. The Knox version is not. Why? Is Mayor Wharton proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=157)|
| 0:02:45| their document? Is Mayor Ragsdale not proud of his document? Which is best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| Before answering, let's look at some common-sense standards. I gave you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| tough question there. Number one, a budget should be clear and it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| credible. It should plainly show what will be spent, when it will be spent, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| who will spend it. It should provide at least minimal information on what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| underwriter, that's the taxpayer, that's you and me, gets for his money. It should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| somehow assure the underwriter that the expenses are warranted, are justified. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| should generate no unanswered questions on its own. The left-hand budget talks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| all of these requirements, the right hand does not. A budget should provide some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=204)|
| 0:03:31| comfort that it is cost-effective, that it is lean and mean in these lean and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| mean times. Score, Shelby, that's lean and mean. Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| meaningless, in my opinion. And a budget should add up. If an analyst finds one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=223)|
| 0:03:51| flaw in it, a major flaw, what assurance can he have that there are not dozens or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| even hundreds more that he hasn't found? I believe that I have found a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| fatal flaw. Please tell me where I went wrong. Here's my reasoning. This budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:09| proudly presents and states that there will be no property tax increase. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| implies that there is no need for one, with the rate will remain at two dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| and sixty-nine cents. The budgeteer goes on to say that each penny of that rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| is equivalent to eight hundred fourteen thousand dollars. Do the math, it's real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| simple. That means an expected contribution of two hundred and nineteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| million by the beloved property tax. Well, great. There's just one problem. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| budget goes on to spend two hundred thirty-four million out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| magnificent two hundred nineteen million dollar pot. I hate to bore you with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| numbers, but they're very important. That's a fifteen million dollar budget we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| have, money we don't have. We ring in the new year with an unheralded fifteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| million dollar deficit which must be handled. Shelby County expects a similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| deficit. They've announced it, they talk about it, they propose contingency plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| to compensate for it. Knox doesn't even mention it. Or does it? Again, what am I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=310)|
| 0:05:19| missing? Is the devil hidden in all these details? There are mountains of details in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| this document that I can't understand. Oh, there's one more thing. The budget on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| left, this one, Shelby County, costs twelve hundred and forty-four dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| per capita. This one, the Knox budget, costs fifteen hundred and fifty-five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| dollars per capita. That's twenty-five percent premium. Do you think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| really get twenty-five percent more value for our government in Knox County? I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| not. We submit that our budget is fatally flawed and should be fixed by you. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| have both the authority and the responsibility under Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| Charter Section 2.01 to amend it and any associated tax problems. We call it your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| duty. We urge you as stewards of the taxpayer dollar to recall and issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| reissue, this dangerous budget. One minute, Mr. Bowers. I'll make it. Under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| restrictions and conditions, we want some conditions that are tough. We want you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| to do it with a lot of guidance. We will be happy to provide suggestions which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| might help you and to work with you in any reasonable way. Now let me quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| add, ladies and gentlemen, that I sympathize with you, not just criticize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| you. Wading through this bureaucratic maze is a monumental challenge indeed. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| got an answer. I wish you good luck and Godspeed and I hope I got through under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| my five minutes and I thank you for your attention. Thank you, sir. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| Lutho. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bower, I do have a bit of an answer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| All right, sir. Of course, I believe that John Troyer, if he were here, could do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| better job being the finance director because I've asked the same question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| myself. The difference when you multiply that out and the revenue and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| different parts of the budget and the difference being is the $269,000 tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:29| with the $814,000 per penny has to deal with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| projected current tax. And when you take a look at the revenue streams coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| and it comes up to more than that, it's because we collect delinquent taxes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| then we also collect interest on that delinquent tax. And that is the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| of the difference there in those two numbers. Well, that's certainly hidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| Okay. I mean, it takes a rocket scientist to read that end of the words. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| understand that. That's why I had to ask the same question. Well, I was a rocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| scientist for a while and I still couldn't understand it. But that is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| substantial difference. And then you also go into the pilot programs and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| TIFs and some other things that come into it. But the majority of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| difference is the delinquent taxes that are collected and the interest that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| collected on the delinquent taxes. Well, now, that sounds very plausible. My only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| point is, shouldn't that have been made clear? Shouldn't there be some words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| about it? A footnote or something to tell me what the Sam Hill is going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| Well, you're more than welcome to ask that of the administration. But that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| just because I had asked the same question, sir. And that was the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| that I got. Because, uh, you know, because of where I work and I work for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| the Knox County trustee, you know, I've asked the trustee and and he is, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| know, we go over all the numbers that are coming into Knox County and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| numbers. Um, I do have confidence in the 2 34 and the 2 30 when the 234| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:20| million with all revenue coming in through different taxes. So the value of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| the 2 69 is a little bit more. I mean, there's a little bit more than 2 69| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| apparently to get. No, the 2 69 is on current taxes. So yes, sir. So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| talking about your Oh, eight taxes that will be collected starting in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| Okay. But if you have not paid your sevens or six going back, we collect up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| to 10 years. So any of that money coming in would be on top of the 8 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| I believe that would be the answer. But I wanted to try to at least give you at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| least part of the answer. But but it's a valid question. And if you still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| further questions, I would I would be if I were you, I'd ask John Troyer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| explain it to you. May I ask you three more questions? No, we need. No, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| not a question. Ask you three more questions. If you'd like to give me a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| call tomorrow, sir, I'd be happy to talk to you. Well, I'll be glad to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| you. But I want to talk to the commission, too. I think he's avoiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| me. I've given you five minutes. I moved you up early, Mr Chairman. Give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| five minutes. Not a quick give him just a few. Can we give him two additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| minutes? But it's not a question and answer period unless they want to. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| go ahead. But I don't want to ask for me to give you two minutes. No more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| granted. I appreciate that, Mr Strickland. I just want to tell you I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| have six more questions like that one. I don't know if I can answer them all. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| don't expect answers. I didn't expect an answer to the first one. You have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| minutes, so that's it. I've probably got a minute and a half now. There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| many questions brought up by this budget. I'll just give you examples of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| some that I have found. I studied it very thoroughly. There are no charts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| accounts or no description of duties like in the Shelby County budget. For| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| example, what does a county clerk do? How many employees work for him? What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| does a general employee? How much is the general employee raised? The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| budget promises 2% plus a couple of step functions. I have no idea what a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| step function is. And by the way, why is it well-deserved? I love some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| county employees, but why is their raise well-deserved? What are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| personal, P-E-R-S-O-N-A-L, services that apply to the mayor's budget? Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| $710,000. Maybe it's personnel, but it's spelled personnel in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| report. What is the cafeteria fund? $22 million. Why did it go up $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| this year? What is the mayor's operating budget? Find it, if you can, in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| document. What is the travel fund? Find it, if you can, in this document. Why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| didn't the mayor sign the budget? I'll give the rest of my two minutes back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| you, sir. And I appreciate that opportunity to extend it a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Commissioner McKenzie? Well, I just want to say something kind of quick and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=732)|

| 0:16:29| going to do some archaeological excavations out there. Admiral, I might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| just explain, Admiral Farragut's birthplace was out there. The home was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| removed in the 19th century. It has disappeared. It was last seen in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=999)|

| 0:17:17| exact location has been determined. MPC has also requested the DAR put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1037)|

| 0:17:39| going to be maintained, then no problem. Commissioner Davis? Yes, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1059)|

| 0:19:43| Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question of the law director? Given Chancellor Fensler's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| ruling on sector plans, can this body address sector plans at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| Good question. We, MPC, we haven't sat down and talked about our options, and of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1193)|
| 0:20:07| course we still don't have a written opinion, do we? We're still awaiting an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| from the Chancellor, which is something that we can then bring back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| and discuss and see where it is we need to go with that. MPC will need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| involved with that as well. I mean, as it stands right now, we certainly have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| ruling that tells us that it is up to MPC to make sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:41| I don't agree with that opinion, but again, that's something that we'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| discuss whenever we get it in writing and see what our options are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| MPC, do you have, Buzz, Mark, do you all have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| I'll weigh in here. We have not seen a written opinion, so we don't know exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| how it's going to shake out, but the northeast county sector plan was adopted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| the planning commission. It was also adopted by the county commission. The MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| has approved a plan amendment, and we are recommending that you approve the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| plan amendment so that the two plans remain in concert rather than in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| So you wouldn't see anything wrong with this body putting their stamp of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| or not on this sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I do not. There's a whole other fract of discourse relating to the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| plan, which is required by state law, which the county commission has approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| which has language in it about amending sector plans by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| We feel that the planning commission has approved the plan and that we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| the county commission to make that same amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:15| What do you recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| I'll agree. Until we have a ruling in writing, something that we can review and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:26| appeal, if that is our wish, you know, given MPC's approval of this, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:35| recommend proceeding with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:50| We're going to give each one of you five minutes. State your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| Commissioners, thank you. My name is Gary Dupler. I live at 6717 Terry Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1376)|
| 0:23:14| That is very close to this parcel of property that the MPC has recommended for this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:27| The problem is, commissioners, that-and I'll just read out of the MPC's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:37| and I'll read out of the Knox County zoning ordinance that was approved as amended through May 29, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:48| because I think that these documents pretty much make our case for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| They're wanting to rezone this area from partial commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1434)|
| 0:24:03| It's currently used for a horse barn and for horses to run around and eat some grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:15| And then when the-on the MPC's recommendation, it says in the neighborhood context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:24| this area has been developed with primarily residential uses under agricultural and RB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| Now, there is a substantial amount of acreage in the area zoned I, CB, and PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| Obviously, Rutledge Pike along that corridor has been tabbed for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:48| But in this particular area that we're talking about today, there is a substantial amount of residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:57| hundreds of residences in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| So they want to change this particular parcel to industrial and heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:11| I think I speak for my fellow neighbors and myself when we don't have anything per se against Claiborne Hauling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:19| or the current owner of this property, Kenneth Ferrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| We feel that Mr. Claiborne is-Mr. Claiborne is, in fact, from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| So we would certainly hope that he would treat this area with respect and run a good operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| which we feel that he has currently with what portion of land he has out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| However, we believe that he can do his stated purpose of processing rock and storing rock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| under a different zoning standard than what they've proposed and what MPC has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| MPC has proposed an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| An industrial zone-this is straight out of the zone regulation, Section 5.61.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| An industrial zone has heavy impacts and adverse effects on surrounding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:19| Last sentence in that paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Such uses are not properly associated with nor compatible with residential, institutional, and retail commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:33| If you allow this piece of property to go industrial and heavy industrial, they can come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| If Claiborne decides they don't want to use this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| and they want to put it to some other use or somebody else wants to put it to some other use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| they can have a creosote manufacturer or treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| They can have disinfectant or insecticide manufacturers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1611)|
| 0:27:00| They can have bleaching and dyeing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| They can have boiler works, blast furnaces, acetylene gas manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| They can pretty much do whatever they want to do with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| and have significant adverse effects on our residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| not to mention the lowering of property values and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| With a little bit more use permitted on review of an industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:27| they could even have the manufacture or storage of explosives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| Ladies and gentlemen, we feel that the stated purpose of Claiborne hauling contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:40| for this piece of property can be done with a different designation than industrial and heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| and have significant impact on our residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| For instance, light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| And I'll refer to the zoning regulations again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Light industrial has more restrictions on it, you know, such as landscaping and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1676)|
| 0:28:06| MPCs approved a slope protection area, but we would say that that's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| They need to have restrictions on this so that they can't bring in everything from dynamite to creosote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| So light industrial, we feel, would do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| And light industrial, in the county's description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| does not have the same effect on the surrounding property as industrial and heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| No, it's his turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Are you with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| Well, you've already had your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| You will get a rebuttal, so you can go then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Chris Edders, 6210 Rutledge Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:10| Before you, I've laid out some packets that actually show the location of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| If you could turn to your first page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| As for the rezoning that the MPC board has already approved and put before you tonight with their recommendation to rezone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:28| one, I ask that we honor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Two, we did give up certain acreage for a buffer to protect the few homes that are at the rear of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| but that after excavated and the slope protection in place, we would be an elevation down below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:48| The adverse acts to the surrounding community we already have behind us adjacent the Stowers Machinery Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| which is zoned under heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| Across the street and down the street from that you have several 20, 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| 40-plus acres that is heavy industrial, which is a North Fork Southern Railroad facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:12| I would just ask that the commissioners look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| Look also that the growth of our company is required for us to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| It's not a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| It's a necessity for an 11-year-old company that's already, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| maintaining and growing some 170-plus employees with the act of hiring daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| There was a request also on this package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| You'll see there was a request on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Just for conversation, there was questions about the rock processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| There's no blasting going to take place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| There's no containment of any explosives going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| This portable rock processor is portable, just what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| It's to be moved from one location to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| We have within our company an excavating division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| which when we go out to different sites, developments will come up on rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| We'll move that processor to that location, process that rock, use it for ballast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| for underlayment, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| The processing and sizing of rock there, as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| this is not much bigger than the actual size of a church bus, a school bus, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| It's not one of your big plants that, you know, if you go out to an actual rock query,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| you have none of the large structure, three- and four-story-high structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| with the big conveyors going every which way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| This is a very moderate request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| a very moderate piece of equipment that we're going to be using there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| That was some opposition we'd had through the MPC process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Again, MPC has approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| I would ask that we go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I would like to reserve some time and let my counterpart here talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| At this point in time, I should have done it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Can I get the MPC report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Mr. Chairman, a lot of the information has already been brought forward by both the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| and the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| This is a request that will allow industrial zoning as approved by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| on only a portion of the site that is being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| As we understand in the information that we received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| industrial zoning is the only zoning that will allow what the applicant wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| There is the light industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| but that is primarily a district that requires the principal activity to be pretty much indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:46| So the zone that he's requested is the zone that would permit his use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| In looking at the site, we did take into consideration the adjacent residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| which is to the south and to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| And in coming up with the recommended area to rezone, staff looked at two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| The slope of that portion of the site and if you look at your staff recommendation on your rezoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1985)|
| 0:33:14| that area, which is roughly in shape of a trapezoid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| that area is the steepest part of the site by far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| and is also a portion of the site that still has a substantial amount of vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| So with those two points in mind, we felt like there would be a substantial buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| in some cases as much as 500 feet between the proposed area for rezoning and the adjacent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:45| The property is sandwiched in between the two areas, zone CB, which are heavy commercial, and to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| You have a very substantial portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| I don't know how large it is, but it's several acres already zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| So we did have some concerns when we were looking at the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| but we felt like with the existing zoning pattern that you had, the existing land use pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| especially to the north along Rutledge Pike, that this was a good way to look at rezoning the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:19| but maintaining part of it in its current zoning, which would require the current condition of the property be maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:27| not used for industrial purposes to provide that buffer between the use and the adjacent residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:37| Did you want to continue on, or do you want opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| Let the opposition go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| I'd seen some red lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| I didn't know if there were any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Opposition, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Again, it's Gary Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| What I'm hearing is that since there's some property in the area that's already been zoned industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:10| we're just going to pile on and affect the homeowners that much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| Stowers was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Stowers sits there and stores a bunch of heavy equipment, but it's not running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| They're selling and renting equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| As far as the railroad yard, we don't have freight trains coming flying past our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| We've got a railroad yard down there where they couple trains and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| But the point here is if you allow industrial slash heavy industrial, they can do with this property what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:46| They don't have to just keep a portable rock crusher there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| They could bring in a plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| They could crush a whole slew of rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| They could do all sorts of things, as is outlined in the county zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| You don't have to take it from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| You can take it from what the county has already promulgated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| Further, we believe light industrial would be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| It sounds like they don't want to put up any kind of enclosure to help keep the dust down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| keep the noise down and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| but it would be a reasonable solution to allow them to do what they want to do as far as processing rock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:32| crushing rock, and storage of rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Storage of rock is not a problem for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| It's the quote-unquote processing of rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| Further, I get one more statement, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| the statement that just a very small number of houses would be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| We don't feel that to be credible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Yeah, there's just a few houses, mine included, at the top of the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| but we're talking about a whole neighborhood here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| And just because this piece of property is not right next to a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| doesn't mean that our neighborhood is not going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| It certainly will be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| Mr. Hedges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Yes, sir, just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| In the MPC hearings, again, I'll bring this back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| The processor that you have pictures of there before you is a compact unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| It is enclosed somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| And when you have this piece of equipment running, processing rock, sizing it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| your dust that the opposition brought up is minimal because it's enclosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| and you know it will fall and be compressed and pushed out the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| as to become part of your rock product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| The noise, we run our operation in operating of business hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| typically as anybody would, you know, from starting time to finish time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| seven to five, we've had those hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Those were accepted and understood by the MPC when they approved us to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| We want to be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| If you'll look at your list there of the contributions that Claiborne Hauling has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| simply to that community and or the owner being raised, reared in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| going to church in that community and being a part of that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| you can see that we're very conscious of what we do and what we don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| I respectively submit that list to you, and you can read that and see that we are very active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| The noise, I'll go back to that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| The noise that is there now is the same noise that they will hear in months and years to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| which is the engines running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| But I ask you again to notice right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| there's an elevation of the few homes that are being mentioned being up on the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| and then the excavating and lowering of this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Your sound, your noise is down here as they hear it now, today, or tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| They'll hear that same noise tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| That's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| Quick questions for you, Mr. Edders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| I drove by and looked at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| We talk about the industrial and light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| If you could have got by with light industrial, would you have gone light industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| Or, Buzz, that may be something for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| You're talking about light industrial zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Light industrial zoning would not permit this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Light industrial zoning is a zone that allows uses that their principal use is indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Then just to reiterate one more time, you're not going to actually be mining rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| You're not going to be digging the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| You're going to bring some rock in and crush them up right on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| It's a recycling, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| It's a processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| It's a sizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| It's a recycling to produce rock to be hauled back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| No mining will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Then this place he's talking about, I think you mentioned Terry Drive or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| Is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Terry Drive is above you, or is it on the other side of that ridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| I believe that it's on the other side of the ridge, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Because that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| I drove by and looked, and I did not see any houses or subdivisions up behind up on the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| So you're saying this guy is on the other side of the ridge from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Respectively, the photograph that I submitted shows the houses that would be touching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| And if you look at that photograph at the top, you see none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| And, Mark, you're all's recommendation as a staff, not MPC, but as a staff, you all recommended to pass this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| What staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| And I'd just like to add that, you know, at the request of the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| we're taking a look at this industrial zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| Tonight we've got the amendments with the performance standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| Already through with the recommendation of approval is a recasting of the list of uses for the industrial zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:55| And you'll see that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| And it eliminates a lot of those nasty uses that you just heard mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| And MPC voted unanimous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Mr. Law Director, I'm trying to understand the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| We know we don't have something written by Chancellor Fansler yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| But what was his?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| Did he tell us in court that we do not have the authority to change sector plans at County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| What I understand is, because I wasn't there, is that he has advised us that that is MPC's basically sole bailiwick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:43| It is their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Whatever this body then does would be window dressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| Now, we've operated the same way, gosh, for 25 years or more, with this body deciding as it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2513)|
| 0:42:09| And I have some serious reservations about the court's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| Well, I know, but we've had people run for five terms in office until just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| And now we see that you cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| So is Chancellor Fansler, are we supposed to go by his ruling, or are you telling us that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| Right now, we have a ruling from the bench which he has not committed to writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| And I don't know what his writing is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| And, again, it may look, you know, we just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| We don't know exactly what it's going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| Other than he believes that it's MPC's sole responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| Now, MPC has acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| They have approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| They have adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| But have they approved it based on them changing the sector plan and coming to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| or do those rules have to be written later because of Chancellor Fansler's ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| We will need to amend the way we do things if Chancellor Fansler's ruling is upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:16| If we decide whether to appeal, we don't know what we're going to do yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| But we're going to bring that to you once he gives us an opinion, a written opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:30| But as it stands right now, I think probably the better course is to do it as we have been doing it for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:44| Ultimately, it may not hurt us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| MPC, as far as Chancellor Fansler is concerned, they've already ruled on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| They basically already changed the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| I think this body still needs to review and approve a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| It is your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| It is your sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| I can't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Maybe I'm just slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Some things that Chancellor Fansler says we need to do, we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Other rulings he rules on the bench we really don't need to do because he's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| Maybe I'm missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Well, you want to argue with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| I'm going to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| It's not against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| I just don't want to end up back in Chancellor Fansler, and I've been very critical of Chancellor Fansler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| I think he wants to run county from the bench, and if he wants to do it, I'm staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| Right now we don't have a ruling in writing, and that's what we're waiting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| It's been some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| It's been, what, a couple of months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| So, you know, we've been expecting it any day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| It's probably overworked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Yes, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| Buzz, can you repeat again light industrial and if it's applicable here or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| I missed that part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| And then after you speak, I would really like to hear from the 8th District Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| We haven't heard from them, and this is in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| and I'd be really curious as to how you feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| We'll give them a chance to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| In the zoning ordinance, you have two industrial zones, the light industrial zone and the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| The light industrial zone is the zone that the use is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| They're required to have their primary activity indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| In other words, you know, if whatever they do, it must be indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| Now, there can be some outside storage, but that has to be heavily screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| But the principal activity needs to be indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| The industrial zone, which typically has been the most intensive zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| it's the last zone that you come to that allows, up until now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| has allowed the most intense, potentially the most disruptive uses, the manufacturing types of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:08| And that has been, up until recently, a pretty broad list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| And as Mark said, next month you'll be getting a very pared down list in terms of the more, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:20| the obnoxious uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| But the industrial zone is the zone that allows the heavier kinds of industrial type of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| And this is a case where you don't have a restriction of being indoor, outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| So that is why he needs, you know, in this particular case, the industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| As we have been advised, he needs the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Now, Mr. Edders, in this picture, this commercial property, is this yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| So this is an expansion of this business, or are these two separate businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| It's an expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| So what you have now, though, is zoned commercial, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| So why are we having to change it to heavy industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| Why can't we just zone it commercial if your current operation is zoned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| Because we are going to do the processing, the recycling there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| So currently, right now, you don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| You just do storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| And that's what that pile of rock is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| It's just a storage of rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| And so you're expanding the business to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| But that will allow them to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| So you'll do crushing on your site then, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Are you through, Ms. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Yes, sir, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| First, Mr. Edwards, thank you for this picture, this aerial view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| We don't usually get a picture like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| I believe a picture is worth a thousand words, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| It really is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| The first one is for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| When you say that you talked about the EMPC plan amendment being in concert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| will you elaborate on that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| Or what are you getting at when you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| The Northeast County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| and currently most of the sector plans that have been adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| have been adopted by both the Planning Commission and the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| Now, when the Planning Commission approves a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| we want to carry that forward to the County Commission to amend in the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| so that the respective bodies are on the same page and working in concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| The growth policy plan, which is required by state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| and has been adopted by the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| has language specific to adopting sector plan amendments in concurrence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| and upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| So we like to have the two bodies always working in concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Now, Mr. Dobler, I did have a question for you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| Were you at the EMPC hearings where this was unanimously approved, 13-0?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| And if you were, is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Were you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| I was not, but my colleague was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| And I guess, and this could be for anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| the staff or administrators could have some input here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| but it seems like was there some discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| There was no heavy opposition from anybody on the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| or in the commission to this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| 13-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| Let me look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| While they're looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| There was some opposition of Mr. Ralph Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| I believe spoke in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| We also had a letter in the packet that was, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| Mr. Edders responded to that also was in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Any input there from you, Mr. Dobler, about whoever your colleague was at the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| Ralph Robinson is my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| He's with me here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| and that other person is my neighbor that submitted the letter, Albert Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Could you give us a summary of your take on what happened at the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| My neighbors raised the same type of concerns that we're raising here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| that it will have an impact on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| They're already crushing rock down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| We have witnessed it on their commercial zone property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| Contrary to what I believe Commissioner Smith talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| and if you look at the MPC's map that's, I believe, from KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| there's a significant subdivision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| There's a good-sized subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| And our houses, my house, my neighbor's house, sits on top of this hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| We don't sit on the other side of the hill, buffered away from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| We sit on top of that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Mr. Edders, did you submit a site plan in place ready to be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3100)|
| 0:51:48| Where are you in the approval process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| That has to take place after we're done, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| In this particular case, yes, that would be the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| It would not require further review by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| And in the site plan, what's the provision made for the slope protection area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| Well, in this particular case, the rezoning that is being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| that was recommended by both staff and supported by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| would leave out the portion of the site that has the steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| That portion of the site will remain zoned RB, general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| So there's no excavation on the slope on what's designated slope protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| It can't conduct any industrial activity on the part of the site that is recommended to remain RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Just for the audience here and our commissioners, we've had 60-mile-an-hour winds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| we've had lightning, we've had flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| and there are power outages and debris on the roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| We're expecting another cell to come through in about an hour that's about equally as intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| So I just wanted everybody to be aware and know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| Who needs insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| Mr. Edders, this machine that you're showing here in our package you gave us, there's two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| One of them is called a small portable processor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| Do you have one of those on site right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Sir, we've been screening our rock there with a green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| It's painted green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| This is a yellow machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| This is your rock processor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| This shows what would be his protege, his counterpart that was here in the first NPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:41| They had brought that ideal up of the dust and all of that that we addressed, the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| So, in fact, I brought this in case there was someone here this evening that had that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Do you have one of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| How much did one of those machines cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| $600,000 to $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| You wanted to go last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| Well, yeah, it's kind of what you touched on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| Other than noise issues, dust issues, you guys worked through those, I guess, in NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| Sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| You all were, I guess, satisfied that that wasn't an issue or that wasn't for you all to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| And as Mr. Donaldson pointed out, two things are going to be happening, first of all, later in this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| The very last item is an ordinance amendment that's going to strengthen the part of the ordinance that deals with noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| odor, all kinds of impacts that can result from industrial and commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| And then next month will be the situation where you'll have before you a revised industrial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| that's going to eliminate a lot of the more obnoxious, up until now, obnoxious industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| So in your opinion, this operation would meet this more stringent requirement that's coming before us in the coming months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:15| I would assume it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Now, you know, it would have to, whatever requirements are put in place, you know, it would have to meet those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:24| I can't particularly answer specifically as to whether or not these would qualify or these would meet those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| But as, you know, when those standards are in place, any use would have to abide by those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| So retroactively, you would go back and ensure that the places that are already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| I would just hate for this one to make it through the door and get grandfathered in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| if it would not meet the more stringent standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| The performance standards are already largely in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| The amendment that we have this evening clarifies the issue of odor and adds outdoor lighting and landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3357)|
| 0:56:07| It already has a standard with regard to noise and particulate matter and other dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| All commercial and industrial operations have to meet those standards today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| The list of uses that we'll be bringing forward will dramatically reduce the current list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:29| but I am sure that the operation that Mr. Etter is talking about is still on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| So there won't be a grandfathering issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| Commissioner Ivan Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| I guess this is for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| Chris, I just want to thank you for your efforts in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| I read some of the things you all do here, and I think it's a great output.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| And I'd like to ask, who does the designs on your trucks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| Grady Veg, Rutledge Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| They do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Thank you, Commissioner Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Commissioner Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| No disrespect to the MPC or your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| I just feel like it almost sets a bad precedent by usurping the sector amendment planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| where we're not involving other people besides yourself, other people that live nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| And I really wouldn't want to support something like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| if it's not gone through that process that is in place for this particular reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| So I wouldn't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Thanks to everyone for asking and looking at all the questions that are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| I think several things have come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| If this is the only zoning that's appropriate, looking at the testimony that was given to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:56| the applicant has stated they're only going to work during certain hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| doing certain things, and try to be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| And I don't know what the buffer zone that's being provided is going to be, whether it's 400 feet or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| Having driven around through the neighborhood today and been on ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| I went further than Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| I think he just went there and dead-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| I flew around with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| No, I did travel on Paramount and Terry and Rose something or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3509)|
| 0:58:43| Understanding that there are going to be new requirements placed on this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| that may not be currently there as in the complainant's side of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3529)|
| 0:58:57| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| Like Chris Oat and some things are going to be taken out of that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| And there being performance standards upcoming on noise and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| And since this is in the 8th District, and I guess I'll bite the bullet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| and say that I'll move that we accept this or approve this with the MPC recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:29| following whatever new rules that may come up involving that type of zoning in the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:39| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| And property moved and seconded for both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| How many no's are staying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Two no's and one staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| Not against your project, just trying to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| Is that for both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Yes, for both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Yeah, both of them were read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| 6-H-08-RZ, request of Hound Dog Investments for rezoning from A, Agricultural, to OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3623)|

| 1:00:42| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Seeing none, 5th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3647)|

| 1:00:52| For MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Property moved and seconded to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3657)|

| 1:01:03| Zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| These two have been deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| This one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| This is deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| But the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| 6-A-08-SP is an appeal by David Harbin for LKM Properties LP of MPC denial of northeast county sector plan amendment from LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:45| which is low-density residential, to C, commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| This property is located on the southwest side of Ellistown Road, southeast of Millertown Pike in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| Read the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| The next one is also an appeal by David Harbin for KLM Properties LP of MPC denial of rezoning from A, agricultural, to C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:11| general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| This property is located on the southwest side of Ellistown Road, southeast of Millertown Pike in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:22| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Mr. Chairman, Arthur Seymour, Jr., I'm here on behalf of the property owner, Georgia Weddington, and the applicant, LKM Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:34| Do you want me to go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| Is the opposition here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| First, let me get the MPC report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| As written to the record, this is a request for a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| The sector plan amendment is to change the sector plan from low-density residential to C, commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3774)|
| 1:03:02| and the rezoning from agricultural to C, general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| Both of these requests were approved or, excuse me, were denied by the planning commission by an 8-4-1 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:15| The property is located on the southwest side of Ellistown Road, southeast of Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| The request from the applicant is the existing land use is residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:33| The applicant's request is to add to an additional track that is already zoned C, a general business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:42| with the proposed use being a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| This would be an extension of an existing parcel that is already zoned C, a general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| The planning commission recommended denial, noting a couple of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| First of all, although the growth policy plan designates this as being in the urban area outside the city limits of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:10| the planning commission seemed to note that the area did continue to have more of a rural character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:19| that it was not urban in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| although the growth policy plan designates something a little bit different than just being urban or rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| But they did note the surrounding area being rural or having a rural nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| They also seemed to note the fact that there was additional property in the area that could be developed for commercial purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:43| and factored this into their thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| It is located at the intersection of a collector street and a minor arterial street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| and there was opposition that was present at the meeting that spoke against the two requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| So the planning commission did vote to deny both the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| and the rezoning, again, by a vote of eight for the denial, four against, and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:12| Buzz, this is where I think we're on a slippery slope here with the chancellor's ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| The MPC has voted to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| They're asking us to come back and overturn MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| And as I understand the chancellor's ruling, he has initially said, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| I mean, so is that your understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| I mean, is that how your folks are seeing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| I'm looking for some guidance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| Based on the oral findings, you would have to believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| There are provisions within the codes and within the growth policy plan that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3940)|
| 1:05:48| upon receiving a recommendation from the planning commission on a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| you may act with a finding that there are changing conditions in the area, that specific language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3954)|
| 1:06:02| Mr. Owings, here we have a situation where the MPC has denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| We're being asked to overturn the MPC action and change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| This is a little different than what we did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| So you're ruling on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| It's much different than if you were just going to consider an approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:33| This may be one that we really ought to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:42| Arthur, you can give me all your heartburn on that if you wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| but this may be one with a disapproval by MPC that we ought to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4005)|
| 1:06:53| until after we have Chancellor Fanzer's ruling in writing and see what our options are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4013)|
| 1:07:00| Obviously, if they have approved of a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| the judge seems to say that, well, that's about as far as you need to go anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| So we certainly feel more comfortable in proceeding forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| And MPC certainly, as we do as well, wished, I think, to do that for the reasons that have been expressed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:26| But if we're looking at a plan amendment where it's been turned down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:33| I'm afraid if the Chancellor rules through a written opinion that he might then say that MPC has acted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4053)|
| 1:07:44| and we have no authority to act, I would suggest that we defer this matter until we have that opinion in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4064)|
| 1:07:58| May I discuss this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| Mr. Mullen, Mr. Owens, an associate who was in court, and I have discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| Let me point out just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| First, a court does not act through opinions until they are rendered in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:18| put into judgment form or order form, and are entered on the minutes of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| And we have 30 days to appeal and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| And the court has not done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| And that's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| We're going to bring that to you whenever he does put that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| I guess you have to assume the Chancellor is not going to change his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| I wasn't in the courtroom, but I've talked to Mr. Mullen about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| Let me tell you what happened in this case, if I may, by way of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| This matter was recommended by MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| And you have in front of you that this intersection already has CA zoning added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4132)|
| 1:09:00| LKM Properties owns the property that is in, I would call it, the southwest quadrant of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4140)|
| 1:09:13| They could put a convenience store on that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| And there is in your packet a configuration showing what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4158)|
| 1:09:26| The property right here that Mrs. Weddington, and she's here and a bunch of her neighbors are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| and I would be remiss if I didn't ask them to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| They are all in support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| She's the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| She's lived out there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| And I just want to recognize them for coming out on what turned out to be a rainy and stormy night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| This is eight-tenths of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| If this property can be acquired, Wigles can redo a convenience store on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| that provides a lot more buffering from the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| That's why I think her neighbors like the proposal to rezone this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| MPC has, quote, a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| When staff recommends that an item be passed, the applicant agrees with staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:24| and no opposition has been heard from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| This item passes at the first of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| There's no real discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| This item was on the consent agenda until the afternoon of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| The applicant assumed that it would be passed because MPC lets you know ahead of time that it's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| These arguments were not presented at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| and I think this makes very good sense staff recommendation and why this eight-tenths of an acre ought to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4251)|
| 1:11:00| so it can make a convenience store there that will better protect the store from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| Be that as it may, if your inclination is to follow Mr. Owing's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| I would request that the matter be remanded to the MPC where we can fully discuss this with the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:23| with the applicant, with Mrs. Weddington there and her neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| to discuss why it is essential for her to have this property rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| She is 80 years old, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| Seventy, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| I sincerely apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| Need some insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| Seventy years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Anyway, she needs to move out of a single-family home into a condominium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| and she wants to go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| And it's going to be a little I apologize, Mrs. Weddington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4320)|
| 1:12:05| But anyway, to break the issue rather than postpone it indefinitely here, we need a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:14| And I think if your inclination is to postpone, it would be better to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| I think the logic of MPC staff's position and the position of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| and Mrs. Weddington makes all the sense in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| Everybody around there but one neighbor supports this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| We have canvassed the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| I think when MPC is presented with that evidence, they will certainly recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| Now, if I may, one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| You all are the legislative body in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| You all make changes to the text of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| You all make changes to the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| MPC makes recommendations only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| I disagree with what I've heard about the Chancellor's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| But if you are concerned about that, let us go back to MPC, get this done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| and then come back here with, I feel confident, a recommendation from not only the MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:21| but the commission that this is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| It's good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| It's right for the neighborhood as evidenced by their representatives here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| You were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| In light of the lateness of the hour, I was going to say that I drove by this location every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4416)|
| 1:13:44| for several years going to work, so I know exactly where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| and I know what's taking place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I'm receptive to this zoning based on the fact that you've got a spot there to do one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| and you can add this to it and have better buffers and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| But my concern is with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| and I would like to see you take this off our agenda or our table or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| and go back to MPC with it without action here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| No, I'm not making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| He's going to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| If those are the two options, we would much prefer, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| to go back to MPC and present a full case there and we feel confident about the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| And you see that I'm concerned with what the law director has had to say all evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:38| I'm still concerned with what he has to say to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| Was that in a form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| Buzz, Mark, does that create any hardship for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| as far as returning it to MPC for further consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| The only question we have is, and I was thinking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| we have a one-year rule like you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| Since the commission has already recommended it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| we don't know if that has any impact on the one-year rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| You all have the one-year rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| I don't know that that's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| I didn't know if you all had it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| It's with MPCs, but we would ask you to waive that certainly in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| We could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| So that we're not taking action, Mr. Seymour, you're the one taking the action right now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| Well, I think it requires action from you all, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| to send it back to MPC with the recommendation that it reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| I think a motion that MPC reconsider the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| I'll make a motion that MPC reconsider this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| I'd like to add an amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| Well, all of the rest of the appeals in our book are all denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:59| Well, let's just take them one at a time because that may not be what those people want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| I have a couple of questions for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| This opinion from the chancellor has not been published yet, has it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| So we're not exactly sure the wording of this decision and when it would apply and when it would not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:31| Not been put to writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Is there a potential for us to appeal this decision by the chancellor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:43| I mean, I certainly am not a lawyer, but I don't see where he's coming from on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| I mean, I disagree with the opinion and I've heard from a number of attorneys who disagreed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| So this is a decision that may very well be appealed, might it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Can we act on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| If I do a substitute motion that we approve, can we act on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| And then depending on how the chancellor's decision is written and depending on whether we appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4624)|
| 1:17:12| and whether we win that appeal or not, that may change this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| But by going ahead and voting for this today, can we not go ahead and go on record that we're for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| I don't see any reason to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| I think given the denial of MPC, certainly the better course, and given what the court has told us in open court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:36| the better course is, given the testimony here today, too, is to refer this back to MPC for further consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:47| There is apparently a request for further hearing below, and it might resolve it, and it might not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4667)|
| 1:17:54| It might come back next month, and if it does, we can deal with it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| But that seems to be the better course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| It really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| Even we're basing this on an unpublished opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| We certainly know what the judge intends to put to writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:18| We certainly know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| And we don't like what we hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| Well, I mean, I certainly don't like what I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Here's what I hate to do is I hate to hold this woman up with her deal based on an unpublished decision that we plan to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:40| Well, ultimately, you may put her rezoning at risk, too, by approving it without first going back to MPC and obtaining their blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:55| She could get tied up longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Well, I'm prepared to make the substitute motion to approve, but I want to ask Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| would you like for me to make that substitute motion, or would you like me to back off and go with the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| Now you've put him in a real box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| Commissioner Lambert, obviously we would like the appeal to be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4753)|
| 1:19:21| This is the way we've done it for, as Mr. Owens said, for 25 plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| If MPC is a recommending body in these issues, certain areas they are the final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| But in zonings and sector plan amendments, we've always understood they were the recommending body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| and you all as the legislative body were the final ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| So there could be a divergence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| MPC might recommend something, and you all might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| Well, it happens every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| We do it every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| And so the peculiarity here is the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4794)|
| 1:20:03| We've just had a court to tell us that we needed to go a different course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| And by referring it back to MPC, we certainly avoid some adverse consequences for all parties here, I think, including this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4808)|
| 1:20:21| You know, Arthur, I think what I don't want to see is us to put Mr. Weigel in a box either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| If he gets something out there and builds on it or whatever and then gets turned down by a lawsuit somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| and he's got something he can't do anything with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| So I don't want to put Mr. Weigel in that box either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| I think I like your motion, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| Well, I'm going to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| And I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| Like I said, this is an unpublished decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| It may well be that once we see this decision in writing that it would not affect this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| And if it does, in fact, affect this zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| this is a decision that we have already decided as a county that we disagree with and we intend to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| And so based on that, I make the motion that we approve, and I hope someone will give me a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| I substitute motion that we approve, and I hope that someone will give me a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4879)|
| 1:21:29| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| Yes, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| I just want to say thank you for being so responsive with regard to some of my questions about the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| and getting those signatures, and I want to thank them for coming out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| As I understood you to say, Mrs. Weddington is going into a condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| And so the sale of this property is probably contingent upon her being able to go into that condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| So how will that impact her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| I mean, does this have a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| Can you come up here, Mrs. Weddington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| You better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| I'd like to speak for you on that issue, but I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| Arthur, I don't know what you were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| She doesn't look like a day over 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| Younger than I am, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| I can't make it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| I think I looked at the clock and saw it was 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| I need your name and address for the record, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| Georgia Weddington, 2721 Ellis Town Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| And I can't afford the condo if I don't sell my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| But is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Do you have, like, a contract or any sort of down payment that you have put on to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| Will that be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| I mean, will that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Will you lose any earnest money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| Is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| I put some money down, and it is contingent upon me selling my house, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:54| I'm Margaret Breeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| I'm the realtor for Ms. Weddington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| Can you speak into the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| I'm Margaret Breeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| I'm with Elite Realty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| And your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| And name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| Margaret Breeding, 712 Baldwin Station Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| And I'm her realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| And there is a contingent upon her selling her property, and there was a three-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:22| And that period is just about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| And we'll have to put her condo back on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| So you could potentially lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| Exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| And we don't have another condo at the price range that we're selling her this one for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| Hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Folks, these are real people's lives that we're dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| And we can play a game of, you know, getting in a tug of war with the chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| I don't think the chancellor wants to keep this woman from being able to buy this condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| All of the neighbors apparently want the Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| I bet he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| Except one, because they've signed a petition saying that they would like to have it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| And I think we need to do our jobs, roll up our sleeves, and let's vote in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| This woman's life is on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| She gets to move into a condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| She's at an age where she'd probably prefer living in a condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| The upkeep will be a little easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| The folks in the neighborhood, in this day of high gas prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| would like to have the convenience of a convenience store close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| I think this is a situation that is a win for everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| And apparently we only have one person that is opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| And I just think we need to stand up and we need to vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| and we don't need to shoot it down based on an unpublished opinion that is definitely going to be appealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| that probably will not even affect this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| Can I say something just real quickly to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| Yes, you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| It may very well have an effect on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| You know, if I'm the opposition to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| and there is a chancellor who has already ruled that this body doesn't have the authority to overturn MPC's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5098)|
| 1:25:11| then the first thing that I'm going to do is to go into court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| and make the same allegations that the parties made in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| and I think it puts the whole project in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:26| It puts this body in the position of approving a matter that it has, at least by one judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:39| is an oral opinion here that this body does not have the power or authority or jurisdiction to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5139)|
| 1:25:48| Certainly the safer course, I think, for all parties concerned, including this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| is to go back to MPC, let them have a full and complete hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| It doesn't sound like perhaps all of the parties were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| and maybe they need to have a much more lengthy discussion about and listen to their staff or whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:16| but that certainly is the better course other than approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| And like I say, if I were the opposing party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| the first thing I would do is come in and make the same allegations that were made with Midway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:32| and it would put the whole project virtually on hold, I would think, right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Let me ask, ma'am, and your real estate agent, where is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| Could she get an extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| Ma'am, I'm hearing both sides here, but could she get a 30 to 60-day extension on her condo to do that, in your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5208)|
| 1:26:55| if we have to do what the law director tells us to do here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5215)|
| 1:27:04| We can probably get an extension, but with a first right of refusal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| if anybody else comes along that wants the condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| Then let me ask the opposition that's there, would you do what the law director is saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| Would you oppose her and keep her from getting her condo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| What, will you go to the courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| I need your name and address if you're going to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| Okay, Jeff Brandon, 2703 Ellistown Road, two houses down from Mrs. Weddington's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:40| And the only reason I'm asking you, Jeff, is because you're the only one here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| but would you go to court and oppose this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| Could you kind of clarify the circumstances, because I'm not following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| I apologize up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| This is my first time I've ever been in front of county commission, so I have no clue as to the quorum, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| I simply came to the NPC meeting, argued my point there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| They're saying, Jeff, if county commission approves this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| you may have the right to go to the court and say that we shouldn't have and keep her from getting her condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| Approves overturning the zoning or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| So if you approve overturning it, then you're asking me if I have the right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:29| You have the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Will you go to court and oppose it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| I don't know if that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I would advise you not to comment on that until you could retain counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| I think that's an appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| You can't get him to obligate himself one way or the other tonight based on five minutes' worth of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| I don't think that's an appropriate question to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| Because just because he's here in opposition, it could be hundreds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| Any person that is aggrieved by a decision may appeal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| So it's not just this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| I just wanted to find out if you had a feeling one way or another, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| Well, obviously being a neighbor and my family has known her and her husband and her son for 20, 30 years, 40 maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5355)|
| 1:29:28| of course I personally would not want her to be denied getting into a condominium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| However, you know, the circumstances surrounding that, if it in turn affects my two-year-old son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5375)|
| 1:29:44| then, you know, I am going to have to stand up and say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| We've got to find a different way of getting her into a condominium if that's what she desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| My contention on this was I never saw a for sale sign in her yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5394)|
| 1:30:01| The only signage I've ever seen in her yard was an MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| So this sale that's been going on between Wagles and Mrs. Weddington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5405)|
| 1:30:13| I didn't even know anything about it until I saw the MPC meeting sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| And so then I came down and voiced my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| And, of course, they made their decision and locked it out or did whatever it was that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:27| So, you know, no, as a personal, you know, friend of the family, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5427)|
| 1:30:34| I would not want to keep her from going into a condominium or getting into better housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| You know, but at the same time, you know, I've still got to, there's some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| there's some criteria that's got to be met, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:50| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| What criteria do you think needs to be met, in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| Well, and I don't know if, are we getting into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| I mean, or are we trying, I just want to find out, are we, like, going to delve into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| or are we just going to kind of gloss over it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| Chairman, can you give him a few minutes to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| I would because it's only appropriate that, go ahead, I'm going to let you go ahead and speak for up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| And I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| Opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| Yes, sir, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| We've got some time left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| I'd like to, you know, have it for rebuttal because I know we've spent way too much time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:31| Way too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| Sir, I'd already given an order that we will not hear that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Like some mulch crispies in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| Yeah, it was a bit too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| I've got numerous concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| One is, and I'm not sure which one of these neighbors are actually, quote, unquote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| downstream from this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| I'm two houses away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| I have an open creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| I have horses that drink out of that creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| I have well water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| LKM is Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| I have nothing against Weigel's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Matter of fact, speaking of my two-year-old son, I have the milk cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| I buy my milk there, two gallons a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| I have nothing against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| The thing is, where they're located, rainwater runoff is going to come onto my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5556)|
| 1:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| I have a ditch that leads to a large stream that, when it rains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| like this thunder boomer frog strangler we just had, I can go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| and I'll be up to my knees in water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| So I have, not to mention my groundwater, since I am on well water, I have water concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| I have noise concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| I have light pollution concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| I have odor concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| We could go down that list, and I don't want to waste your time in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| but these are legitimate concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| This is not one bad, doesn't want to play ball or get along with his neighbors kind of neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:24| I didn't know anything about this until the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| and then I argued my point, what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| I had no idea that, at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| that selling her piece of property was contingent upon Weigel's getting this rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5613)|
| 1:33:39| But apparently it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| Now, you know, Weigel's can still buy the piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| and let this go on out so she can go ahead and get her condominium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| I don't see a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| I do want to address just a couple of statements that were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| Like I said, I don't know which of these neighbors actually live downstream like I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| Weigel's can still go ahead and put a store in if they want, even on the existing piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| Canvas the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| Now, I find that kind of funny because I guess I'm not part of the neighborhood anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| because I never was canvassed, whatever that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| No one came to ask me my opinion or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| even though at the MPC meeting the little engineer fellow came up to me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| well, where do you live, pointed out to me on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| I showed him I've not heard one hair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:37| I think it's kind of funny when the MPC, or I wouldn't call it funny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| but when the MPC makes a decision on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| and then you've got a lawyer here that when a judge makes a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5685)|
| 1:34:53| that he believes county government should work a certain way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| we've got a lawyer that's saying, well, let's don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| Let's circumvent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| Let's go over here and do this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| I'm sorry if that's accusatory, but that's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| He's used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| I find that if the county commission decides that you're not going to cross this judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:22| whoever he is, I don't know who he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| If you're not going to go cross-grain to his decision, then MPCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| they had an opportunity at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| I don't know what the problem was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| I got up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| I stated my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| I don't understand why they weren't there or they didn't say very much to argue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:44| I put a note about waiving one-year rule, but I forgot it, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| In essence, you know, like I said, my main concerns are we've got groundwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| We've got noise pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| I'm two houses away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| We've got noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| We've got light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| And that's why I would respectfully request that county commission either refers this back to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5762)|
| 1:36:11| in their ruling or whatever avenue that you guys have available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| I appreciate you listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| Hang in there just a second or maybe something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| As opposed to Mr. Lambert, we obviously have significant opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| Our staffs recommend against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| Our MPCs recommend against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| Our law director is also giving us counseling in accord with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| And so there's quite a bit of opposition here, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| So there was one question or one comment or one phrase that tends to pop into my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| and this is probably for Mark or Buzz, and that is, is this an example of spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5821)|
| 1:37:08| two parcels being put together so we can get waggles in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| That's something that kind of sticks out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| At this particular intersection, all four corners are currently zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| But that commercial designation on each corner does not include an area big enough to do the type of operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5844)|
| 1:37:33| that folks want to do now, especially if we amend our performance standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| and add landscape buffering requirements as we have proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| And you will consider in your next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| If this were to be remanded back to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| I would like to see us take a look at that whole corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| and perhaps reconfigure the existing zoning that's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| and reconsider the plan so that not all four corners would ultimately develop as commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:10| unless it's in a very neighborhood type of a setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| The idea of having a neighborhood convenience store at a major intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:24| an intersection of a major collector and a minor arterial, is in our mind good planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| and there is currently commercial zoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| Our plan speaks to logical extensions of existing zoning or plan designations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| and that's the basis of our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| which was actually to approve the plan amendment and the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| because it was an extension of an existing zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:55| I guess this question will be for Gary Norvell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| Gary, can you address the water runoff in your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| I know this concerns stormwater, and I know it's definitely a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| but I thought you might be able to address some of the problems he's asking about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:14| I'm Gary Norvell, Batzenheim's Norvell and Poe Engineers in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| Yes, as far as the stormwater goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| the county ordinance is very specific about what we have to do as far as engineering design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| not only for stormwater volume but also quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| and there will be certain things that we'll have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| As far as looking at the watershed as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| this one particular parcel is very minute compared to the watershed as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| and one thing I think that he is talking about involves pretty much the entire watershed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5984)|
| 1:39:52| and not just this one little part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| I'd like to also mention in regard to lighting, and we've got some photographs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| if the commission would like to see those, of a site that this particular site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| that I have the photographs of is located in Maryville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| but there are two other sites in Knox County that have the same kind of lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| and this is a turndown type of lighting that does not bleed off the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| so that it does not affect the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| And I've got some photographs, if you all would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:31| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| Yes, I appreciate Gary doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| I know he is a well-qualified engineer, and we've dealt with him for the city on drainage problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| and I just want to make sure the gentleman behind you understands that you will work with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| and the building will also help him as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| And I guess just to be real quick, what these photographs do show is how that lighting works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| It shows we've got three different sets of photographs that work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6053)|
| 1:41:02| and show what it looks like in daylight and what it looks like at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| so that you can see that this lighting does not bleed off the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| Commissioner DeFrieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| Mr. Donaldson, I don't have the copy in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| and my computer just now ran out of battery because our meeting has been so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| And I loaned my power cord to another commissioner who didn't have hers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| Anyway, that being said, I would like for you to read for me the conditions for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6086)|
| 1:41:33| Can you read for me the criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| In our general plan, which is the parent document for our land use plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| it says Exhibit 4 consists of the land use plan maps from each of the 12 adopted sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:50| The plan is amended by the periodic updates of the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| The plan may also be amended in response to applications from property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| Plan amendment applications are usually filed in conjunction with rezoning applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:06| There is a further paragraph regarding logical extensions of existing zoning or development patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| The planning commission may find that a particular rezoning or plan amendment is approvable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| because it is a logical extension of an existing boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| And then further on, it speaks to changes of conditions warranting amendment of a land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:30| usually conditions that have changed sufficiently to warrant a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| or contrary to the plan's recommendation should result in an amendment to the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| Administrative procedures are in place to allow the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| to recommend minor plan amendments accompanied by rezoning applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| The planning commission reserves the authority to recommend land use plan changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| based on substantially changed conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| Substantially changed conditions include the introduction of significant new roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| or utilities that were not anticipated in the plan and make development more feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| an obvious or significant error or omission in the plan, changes in government policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| such as a decision to concentrate development in certain areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| or trends in development, population, or traffic that warrant reconsideration of the original plan proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| So the planning commission can make changes based on changing conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| or logical extensions of existing zoning or development patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| Buzz, is it my understanding that this has been approved for Wigles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| the piece of property there on the corner, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| I think at this point in time, even though Wigles has been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| maybe the more correct way to look at it has been, well, I don't know about approval for Wigles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| I know that the thing that we considered at MPC was the zoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| At some point in the time, Wigles may change their mind or it could be something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| Okay. And I guess I was just going because I saw these pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| So what we're looking at is do we accept the additional piece of property to be included in the CA is all we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6253)|
| 1:44:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| That's correct. It's eight-tenths of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| How wide is that at the front? Does anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| About 80 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6275)|
| 1:44:41| The existing lot along Millertown is 321.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6281)|
| 1:44:51| The proposed lot that the 50-year-old owned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| The proposed lot is about 160 feet frontage along Ellistown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6296)|
| 1:45:02| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| If I could add one thing about those photographs, what that means on each one of the three pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| the top photograph is what the particular view looks like in the daytime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| and the bottom is a comparable nighttime view so that you can see what the front of the store looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| The third page is the rear of the store so that you can see that there's no light bleed over at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6318)|
| 1:45:27| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| Yeah. On second thought and after consulting with my law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| I've decided to withdraw my motion and go back to Craig's motion to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6337)|
| 1:45:46| Mr. Strickland, may I address you first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| Was that about an hour ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| May I address you first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| My name is Gordon Burson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| I live at 7910 Millertown Park, which is actually adjoined to the Weigel's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6353)|
| 1:46:00| It's adjoined to both pieces of property that they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| I have the most property down through there, almost two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| To answer one question, why it got through the MPC and nobody objected to it, I was there at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6366)|
| 1:46:12| I've been before you all 20 years ago when some of you weren't here, some of you might have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| Not 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| Not since the spring formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| I didn't say anything because MPC had recommended this be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| To me, it seemed like it was a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| It really surprised me, and I think it surprised some of the MPC staff that it did not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6393)|
| 1:46:39| Their conception of it, I know Mr. Smith and some of you all have been out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| I've lived out there 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| That area has grown tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| I sit out on my patio at night and watch cars run a stop sign every third or fourth car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| I'll be happy for waggles because they'll probably stop that problem and we'll probably get a red light up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| But it's not a rural community anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| This is community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| They're building a bunch of houses around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| I own a business out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| If the MP staff had looked at their recommendation 21 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| my piece of property, an acre of it, was recommended to be rezoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| which is completely off the plat because of the other piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| The thing that I look at is I had to go through the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| They recommended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| I came to you all, and it was turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| That was the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| I feel for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| You know, you all have opened up a big can of worms tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| because you really penalized a woman who, if this does not go through, it goes back to the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| this is going to take probably a month or two to get back through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| Then Mr. Brandon, who's a friend of mine, can come back and object and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| well, you all waived your one-year ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| You decided to act on this very quickly, which is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| You know, they've got a one-year rule that you cannot operate on any rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| I think the problem is if you don't vote on it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| and make a statement of what can happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| then how does me as a citizen of Knox County, where's my protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| I don't have any protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| If MPC turns me down on anything in the future, who do I have to appeal it to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6501)|
| 1:48:27| Do I go home for a year and then come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| Or now do they have to change their rules and say, okay, every 30 days we're going to relook at this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6510)|
| 1:48:37| Here's a woman that cannot sell a piece of property, you know, without it being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6517)|
| 1:48:43| I'm the biggest property owner next to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| The ditch that Mr. Brandon talks about runs down beside my house all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| If you go by my house, there's a 50-by-60-foot cronson hut on that business, on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| It's not a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| But it needs to be rezoned tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| If not, she stands to get penalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| And from what you're talking about, Mr. Owens, and I know enough about law to be dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6545)|
| 1:49:10| and I've owned enough businesses to know that you all face a legal hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6550)|
| 1:49:16| Mr. Brandon can come back and sue when you all pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| Ms. Whittington can come back and say she didn't get fair representation out of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| And I feel sorry for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| It's a can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| But until that ruling gets passed in writing, I don't see how that law can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| It's a verbal ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| It's not in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| But like I say, I'm the one that most has to stand to lose on this, and I don't object to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| I feel it needs to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| I feel that the MPC, if I had stood up, and really I should have and I did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| if I had stood up, it would have went through that night, that day we were down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| because I own the most property, have the most to lose in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| The judge's ruling is certainly guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| And the judge basically is about to more or less throw out a major project that we have ongoing in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6601)|
| 1:50:18| I don't know what else we can say about it or what else the body can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| but it seems to me that if it wasn't fully discussed at MPC, perhaps they need to listen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:35| With a two-thirds vote, I'm not their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| They have their own attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| But with a two-thirds vote, they can suspend their rules and they can waive that one-year requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:45| And I would think that's a very rare event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| I don't know if it's ever occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| But a case like this, given the ruling, the oral ruling that we received from the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| I think certainly warrants further consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| And it may be that you and if you have any qualms about it or the other opposition here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:11| maybe that something can be worked out at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| I would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| Well, I think it would stand on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| If the MPC had bothered to come out and look at the location, see what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| the amount of traffic, the fact that it's been zoned commercial for 30 or 40 years, all four corners have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| I mean, you know, you're passing it back to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| And I understand why you're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| It's the legal and easiest way to get out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| But that comes back to the case before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| Does that mean that somebody can object to what you decided on that woman, on her house, her property, and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| no, we decided that the admiral was buried there and we want to overturn that ruling now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| So you can't come back and say I'm going to do it one way for one person and another way for another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| Yeah, well, they approved it on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| And certainly if we're in concert with MPC and they have approved of the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6719)|
| 1:52:06| certainly we're on better footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| You were here, and what I said earlier was basically, you know, we're more or less rubber stamping, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:17| it would be according to what the judge had said, what MPC has done in that other case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:24| Basically, this body, if there's opposition here and they wish to overturn what this body has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:35| if they're fortunate enough to file it in Chancellor Fansler's court, I know what he's going to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:42| And so we're kind of in a hard spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| But like I say, you're the governing body basically in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| You decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| Are we just not going to decide tonight and all decisions are going to be made like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| The suggestion was made earlier on that we send it back to MPC and for further consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6777)|
| 1:53:05| It sounded like a great idea at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| I still think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Can I address one thing to you then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| If that's the case and it goes back to MPC and Mr. Brandon, now he's got to know the legal course basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:19| because they're breaking their rule of one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| No, it's not breaking the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| If they suspend their rules, then they can certainly legally consider the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| It takes a two-thirds vote of their body most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| Again, I'm not their attorney, but if you came here, it would take a two-thirds vote of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| It would take 13 of the 19 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| What happens if it goes back to their body and they decide not to listen to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| Then it will come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Well, we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| And it will come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| Commissioner Lufo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| I would like to add, if the second will agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| to try to help speed up some of the concerns that this gentleman just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| And to help this lady out here as well is to ask MPC within my motion to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6843)|
| 1:54:11| Buzz, could you hear it this coming month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| or is there something in your rules that would prevent from this being heard in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6854)|
| 1:54:21| I would like to be able to have this heard at MPC at your next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| so that we can then hear it as soon as possible back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| So I want to try to speed this up in whatever I can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| so that it's not two or three months down the road, it's next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| We have the opportunity to properly publicize this for our August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6880)|
| 1:54:47| We're blessed this month with five weeks between the two Planning Commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| In looking at this, this is a peculiar intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| because there are little splotches of commercial zoning on all four corners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| and on at least two of them that zoning doesn't cover the entire parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| We may want to broaden our look at this particular plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| to consider all four quadrants of that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| and perhaps qualify it with the types of zone districts that we would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| In doing that, we could do it as a governmental plan amendment initiated by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:28| and not have to comply with the 12-month rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| because we're looking at a much broader area with a little bit different circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| So I think that's probably the approach that we'll take with regard to the plan amendment at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:44| I don't need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| Well, I'll make that part of my motion that the MPC takes a look at all that whole quadrant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| all four quadrants of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| And when can we, at the earliest, have this back before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| Could it be in the August meeting or would it have to be at the September meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| If we can get it advertised for the August meeting, which would get it to your September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:10| That would be the earliest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| That's the earliest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| We've already had our July meeting, and so the August meeting is the soonest of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:19| We can put it on our August agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| Can we not go ahead and have it added to our?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| It would require double advertising as far as advertising for both the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:32| and then speculatively advertising for the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| It's no extra cost because we'd have to advertise them both anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| Well, then I'm going to make part of my motion that they double advertise it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| so that we can hear this in our August meeting to help out this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7006)|
| 1:56:53| And hopefully the second will agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| Could we approve this pending their approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| We can't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Who seconded that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| Dr. Brewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| Do you have something, Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| You know, I just want to say to the people, I understand your frustration with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| But, you know, we've been living under some different rules ourselves under the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7035)|
| 1:57:22| and things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Good word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| And, you know, so I understand your frustration because we have a lot of frustration ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| So we're trying to do what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| And like I said earlier, we have some judges who think they want to run this county through the bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| and not the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| But we can deal with that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| Do we have a second on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| No, we have to have a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| Then I'll withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| Let's just vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Everyone understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| It's not a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| It was the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| I withdrew the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| I withdrew the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| He's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| You're the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| No, I was the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| Back to Craig's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| I withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Oh, you withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| Now we're back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| I didn't hear you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| It was the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| Shouldn't we just do that for all the rest and lump them all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| to have all of those be sent back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| We don't have one but one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7122)|

| 2:03:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| What was the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| That the excess funds over what was budgeted be taken out of the administration's part of their budget, the excess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7423)|
| 2:03:56| they'd only budgeted $150,000, and, as you can see, it's a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| So the difference had to come from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| And that was the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| Taken out of where now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| Out of the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| I think it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| Executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| Yeah, someone take it out of the existing executive's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| From what you understand, I mean, they have one less employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| And if they need to, they can use the $20,000 or the $40,000, $50,000, whatever those counts are, or a travel account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7461)|
| 2:04:30| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| Just to be clear, how much more are we spending because we chose to go to a new...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:41| $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| $130,000, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| $163,880.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| $164,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| Yeah, we had a fixed-fee contract, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| Yeah, I understand some of the discussion that seeks to, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7499)|
| 2:05:07| I assume it's consequences for some of the physical transgressions of the county executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7507)|
| 2:05:16| But one thing that I see, or one thing I hope does not happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| is that there are services and provisions to a lot of people in this county that are made by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:33| that are really acts of graciousness and hospitality, for lack of a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:42| Truly, there are some good services that are done, and these, with this action, will likely be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7542)|
| 2:05:51| And so such things as senior citizens get-togethers and they're not going to have food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:59| they're not going to have soft drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| When some middle school needs soccer uniforms, then where are they going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:11| Maybe they're going to go someplace else and get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| But certainly there were a lot of funds that were provided by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| which I see disappearing if this action goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7579)|
| 2:06:28| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| John, you said it was what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| How much you say it's taken, $164,000, out of how much is your budget for the mayor's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7591)|
| 2:06:39| For the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| Yeah, where they're wanting to take this out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| Yeah, the mayor's budget is about $1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7603)|
| 2:06:47| And, you know, we had a long discussion about what the budget should be last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| and here we are a month later and $163,000 was not planned in that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7612)|
| 2:06:58| And I don't think it's fair to charge it to the mayor when we had a fixed-fee contract before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7618)|
| 2:07:04| So that's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| That's the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| You're talking about 12% of his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| So, John, within the budgetary process, you budgeted $150,000, not what the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| So the difference now is the $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| But that doesn't include what we're going to get charged from the comptroller's office either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7635)|
| 2:07:22| What will you be charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Explain that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| The county commission has a separate contract with the comptroller's office to assist Mr. Walls in his audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7646)|
| 2:07:38| But that's not addressed in your amendment, though, is it, Scott, with the comptroller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7658)|
| 2:07:45| I don't know what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| Commissioner Moore, were you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7670)|
| 2:08:01| How much money does the mayor have in undesignated funds or any type of monies in his office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7681)|
| 2:08:08| either throughout his departments, that he could recoup this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| I mean, we know he's got a $20,000 expense account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| We know he's got a $50,000 expense account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| And I know there's a lot of good things, like my colleague Commissioner Norman says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| but if those are really good things and we have to have them, we need to do them for our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| you can always come back to county commission and get approval for these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| We don't want to deny people good services or something that our kids need, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7714)|
| 2:08:44| I think you all helped create it, so you all need to help pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| I don't think it's fair to ask our citizens to pay $164,000 more because of something that occurred up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7728)|
| 2:08:57| First of all, through the budget process, the mayor has made a commitment to find $1.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7737)|
| 2:09:04| and we're still piecing that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| And so we've got cuts yet to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| But you've got Cynthia Finch's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| How much money is left in that fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| Cynthia Finch was not budgeted for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| What about the $50,000 that you have in grant money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7759)|
| 2:09:26| The mayor, I think, has a plan for that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| And a $20,000 expense account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| The mayor's got a plan for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| Your travel, how much do you have in the travel within the mayor's administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| which would include finance, you or anybody else that falls under general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| What kind of monies would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| It wouldn't be $163,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| Well, no, but it could be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| How much money do you all have in travel for general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| Now, without a report in front of me, I couldn't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| Well, it would probably be quite a bit of money throughout general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| So I'll support it with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| I won't support it without the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| John, how many companies bid on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| Two companies bid, one from Johnson City and one from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| So where is KPMG from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| From Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| No local bidders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| No local bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| Yes, Mr. Troyer, how much is Ms. Wagley's salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| You know, that's been documented in the press and I couldn't tell you right offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| I believe it was $72,000, wasn't it, in the press?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| $72,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| And so since we're under a hiring freeze, her position will not be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| We're under a hiring freeze and it's our anticipation not to hire that one during the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7854)|
| 2:11:00| We already counted in the budget savings from the hiring freeze of over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| But that $72,000 could be applied to this, could it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| Plus benefits, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| So benefits would probably be up to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| In the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| In the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| I mean, savings from the hiring freeze was a part of the budget as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| Yes, but Ms. Wagley was working here during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| And so her salary was an ongoing cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| It wasn't a savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| But now it could be construed as a savings because she has left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| We're under a hiring freeze for half a year, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| But that gives us $72,000 or $80,000 more than what we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| That's what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| Ms. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| I believe what you're saying, this is another $80,000 that wasn't considered in that hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7926)|
| 2:12:07| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| So that's another savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| That was the budgeted cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| Over the million in what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| But we still got a million five yet to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7932)|
| 2:12:17| Well, I believe you said that was coming from the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| No, that's in addition to the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| But the hiring, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| So this is a million five is above and beyond the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| But when you made that million in five commitment to save, it did not include Ms. Wagley's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7947)|
| 2:12:35| If she was still here, we'd be paying $80,000 roughly, salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| No numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| Eighty plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| And so I really feel like that's a savings that's not included in the million five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| that you were talking about going through the budget and cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7968)|
| 2:12:54| Commissioner Pinkston, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| Now, does Ms. Wagley have travel and auto allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| and those sorts of things incorporated into her salary as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| There's no auto allowance, and there was some travel for the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| So she wasn't reimbursed for mileage or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| There was some travel expense, but that would still be incurred by the rest of the department employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=7996)|
| 2:13:22| I mean, the department is still ongoing, and so what she's not going to travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| there's going to be other people who will travel in her place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| But does she have a computer or a cell phone or any of those sorts of expenses, space costs, IT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8011)|
| 2:13:40| You know, the computer is already purchased, so that's already a sunk cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8020)|
| 2:13:46| And, you know, there will be some savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8026)|
| 2:13:52| We're not anticipating hiring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| but I think it's a stretch to when the county commission did have a fixed fee contract in front of it on consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8034)|
| 2:14:02| and turn around and penalize the mayor for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| Does Ms. Wagley have a car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8050)|
| 2:14:13| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| We asked, we, this body asked to have the auditor thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| Some people feel for good reason, but we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| We also, this body also, whether we agree with it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8066)|
| 2:14:30| chose to give the mayor $20,000 for this, $50,000 for that, this much for his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8070)|
| 2:14:36| Now, because of our actions, we're asking, and because our actions led to a doubling of this fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8076)|
| 2:14:46| we're now sitting here trying to get cell phones taken out of the mayor's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:52| so that I don't know, I really don't know why we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| So we, right, but I'm not going to say, but we have to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8097)|
| 2:15:06| We have to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| We caused this money to come out of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| We voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| We have to eat that piece of it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| I know the mayor's office is taking a whole lot of money out of fund balance, but we knew, and we knew fully well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8115)|
| 2:15:22| We were told by our finance director that the next accounting firm would cost significantly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8122)|
| 2:15:29| We were told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| And we said, okay, we'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| The county will take it, and the county will have to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| And now here we are, you know, trying to look back and micromanage the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8138)|
| 2:15:44| So I really think this is not a fruitful conversation for us to be having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| I think we need to acknowledge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| We caused this $164,000 or $130,000 to come out of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| We passed the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| We knew exactly what the mayor's office was spending on all of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8157)|
| 2:16:04| And now here we are questioning these things that we voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| We have passed a budget, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| Anything that we add to that budget, we know where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8170)|
| 2:16:18| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| I think there was some on the commission who voted against getting it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| It passed this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| But also the administration is the one who asked Rutherford Moss to give to an illegal fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8187)|
| 2:16:35| It wasn't county commission who asked him to give money to an illegal fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| So at some point in time, we're going to have to start holding people accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| We held the auditor accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| People thought they had done something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| We held them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8207)|
| 2:16:48| Throughout all of this, the administration's money from last year to this year has not been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| They've still got the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| They've got the $20,000 car allowance and call it something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| They've got their $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| They have not been cut one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| And it's time that we hold people accountable in this government and start running like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| And if people make mistakes, they need to be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| And, John, you've got something you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| I'd like to share that the general county budget this year is $6 million less than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8231)|
| 2:17:16| Cuts were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| Cuts were made, but we continue to borrow money and borrow more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| And on this piece, we caused that money to be borrowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| I think they need to be held accountable for what their misdoings were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8247)|
| 2:17:32| And I'm not saying that ours is a misdoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| but I think we just need to be held accountable because we asked for a separate accounting firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| It's that one piece is all I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| I guess this would be for Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| Or maybe Mr. Tory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| I've been reading this article about this $40,000 check that we've sent down to Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| and it's ended up in Johnson City in a bank and been laying up there dormant for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8274)|
| 2:17:58| What does that have to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| What's our possibility of getting that back to take foot towards this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| In the 2006-2007 adopted budget for this county commission, contracted agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| this commission approved $40,000 for a minority health summit, a minority health summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8293)|
| 2:18:19| This commission approved that $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| It was held in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| Contributors to that event included Vanderbilt, University of Vanderbilt Hospital, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, major drug companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8303)|
| 2:18:32| It was a minority health summit sponsored by the state of Tennessee who asked us to play a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8312)|
| 2:18:40| We contracted $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| The event happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| We had participants at the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| Where they deposited the check, I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| But the event happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| It's like giving money to the Dogwood Arts Festival and after the Dogwood Arts Festival occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| the money's in some checking account and we want to know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| What happened to the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| The event happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| The check was cashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| After the check is cashed, we don't trace what bank it goes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| So I know where this article come from, where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8352)|
| 2:19:13| But the event happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8353)|
| 2:19:14| This commission approved the $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| The check was cashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| We're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| What I'm saying, sir, is this money hasn't been used apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| They say it's Norman and account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| Who's they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| The haul shopper, the article I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| Well, ask them how we get the money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| The money was used because the event occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| The event occurred in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| We had people there watching the event occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| It would be the equivalent, like I said, for us to say the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| Mike, we need to get back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| We can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8381)|
| 2:19:42| I just asked you if we had an opportunity to get that money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| I was going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8392)|

| 2:20:15| Mr. Smith, did you not want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| When someone calls for the question, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| Well, I mean, it might affect my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| It doesn't matter how many lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8426)|

| 2:21:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| John, quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| Some of what Tony was saying and what Sam was saying and a little bit what Scott was alluding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| We cut this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| I see where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| They're saying cut it from the mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| But then they turned around and told you then if you've got something like the senior picnic or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| you want to bring it back for us, just bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| Is that what you see that you'd be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| To me, you'd be wearing us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| It's my intent that we have a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| We need to stick to it and not raise the budget, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| This one just was imposed on the mayor's office, and we shouldn't penalize the mayor's budget for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8512)|
| 2:21:59| We agreed on a budget last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8519)|
| 2:22:05| We're off about $100,000 is what you're coming up with, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8525)|
| 2:22:11| It's $163,000 more, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| $163,000 more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| More than the fixed-fee contract than what we had fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| It's more than the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| It's $130,000 more than what you budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| So let's use the right numbers, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| Well, I mean, you've got $130,000 plus an amount yet to be determined from the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| Well, the comptroller's office is something entirely different than from what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| It's additional costs that, yes, that this government is going to have to bear, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8556)|
| 2:22:44| We're going to have to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8564)|
| 2:22:45| But that has nothing to do with this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| Except it's paid from the same line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| That would be there if Rutherford Moss got the contract, would it not, John Steele, yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8574)|
| 2:22:55| I believe that's what Mr. Lutho is trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| Well, what I'm trying to say is that we had a fixed-fee contract of $124,000 for Rutherford Moss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| and we made a provision of about $25,000 for the comptroller's office to total about $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8582)|
| 2:23:09| You know, so here's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| If we do this and you sort of come through us throughout the year, am I going to sit here and keep track of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8591)|
| 2:23:17| all right, now you're up to $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| I mean, I don't mind the hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| I could stay here until 4 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| Commissioner Daniels, are you going to ask a question or am I going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| I would prefer if there wasn't a conversation going on when I ask a question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| Well, they continue to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| Mr. John, where would you propose this money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| You know, as finance director, I hate to say this, but from the fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| I think it was something that's unplanned, one-time expense, and that's the place to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8629)|
| 2:23:57| You know, we have to have an audit, and we've got to get these people started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| They're the most responsive, lowest bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| We need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| Hey, John, the mayor said he's going to come up with $1.5 million savings or try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8644)|
| 2:24:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| Then I guess that's a place to start is wherever he's going to find that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| that's $130,000, $150,000, whatever that number is that you want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8657)|
| 2:24:24| and you can take it out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| Quite frankly, I don't care where the money comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| We have to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| This body has no choice other than to approve this contract one way or another tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| And I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| I agree with Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| If we say that, you know, it's an extra $135,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| and say that we're going to find $1.5 million minus $135,000, that works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8684)|
| 2:24:48| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| Yeah, I'm not good with that voting for that, so I'll have to vote against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| What I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8697)|
| 2:24:58| Well, I've not made that a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| Right now the only motion on the floor is the amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| Let me try to make a friendly amendment to whoever made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8709)|
| 2:25:10| No, Paul did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| Paul, if you'll take this as a friendly amendment to move the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8712)|
| 2:25:21| the director of office on neighborhood salary out and put toward this, and then they can move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8721)|
| 2:25:32| The remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8732)|
| 2:25:33| The remainder can come from somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| but certainly I think that since she is no longer with us that that's an appropriate place to take it from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8735)|
| 2:25:42| Well, I think that's probably one of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| I think I'd go along with that because then we're just talking about $58,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8744)|
| 2:25:48| Well, that might be the $1.5 million savings they were going to be talking about anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8748)|
| 2:25:52| No, it wasn't, because she was still hired when that budget was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| and she's told this commission she wasn't going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8758)|
| 2:25:59| So that's $80,000 that we've got now that we didn't think we had during the budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| I'll accept that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8765)|
| 2:26:08| Yeah, they can take the $50,000 out of the $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| I'll agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we find the money from the $1.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8777)|
| 2:26:22| that Mr. Tory is going to come back to us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8782)|
| 2:26:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| We have a substitute motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| Commissioner DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| I would just like to remind everybody that Chuck Bowers was correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| in saying that this budget was fatally flawed earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| and Commissioner Larry Smith, we do have the right to amend the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| It's not set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| So I just wanted to put that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| I'd like to point out that Commissioner Leuthold was correct in his assessment on the property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| and the $814,000 per penny on the tax rate is current property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8818)|
| 2:27:03| only just as Commissioner Leuthold said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| The difference includes delinquent property taxes as well as payment in lieu of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| especially from KUB, and that's our difference that Mr. Bowers was speaking to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| Anyway, just an FYI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| Thanks, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| We have a substitute motion on the floor to take the money out of the $1.5 million that will be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8838)|
| 2:27:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8848)|

| 2:27:59| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8879)|

| 2:28:01| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8881)|

| 2:28:29| Motion passes 12-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8909)|
| 2:28:35| Move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| Resolution 807, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8924)|
| 2:28:45| This is confirming the appointment of someone as the Hearing Officer for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8925)|
| 2:28:54| Violations Associated with the Ordinance Regulating Sexually Oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8934)|
| 2:28:58| Businesses within Nuffis County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| Law Department, do we have a name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| We want to make a motion we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8956)|
| 2:29:17| I'd like to know, who's supposed to recommend somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| Is it the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| I think the last recommendation came from the Mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| So I think it comes from the Mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| Whose appointment is it, Mary Ann?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| The Commission makes the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| I know, but who gets to pick this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| Is that the Mayor's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| The Commission makes the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| So the name could come from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| The name could come from the Commission as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| but I think the last time the Mayor offered a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| It was Bruce Anderson, and he has opted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8988)|
| 2:29:53| So we asked if he wanted to be reappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8993)|
| 2:29:56| and he's recently told us he'd prefer not to be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=8996)|
| 2:30:00| So we'll come back with another name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| and it is your decision to confirm that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| You do not have a name, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| You will come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9008)|
| 2:30:09| He just told us this past week he'd prefer to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| But I think what I hear Ms. Stackhouse saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| is that we could come up with a name as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9018)|
| 2:30:19| You could if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9019)|
| 2:30:20| Is this a paid position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| $12,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| Per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| Yes, it is going to be a per hour paid position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| Up to $12,500 for six months, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| And it was, was it $125 an hour or $150 an hour, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| It was a certain, we passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| Under certain qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| Well, they have to be an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| But we passed so much per hour, and I can't remember that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| and it was the $12,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| This past year we never had a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| So we never spent any of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| Until there's a hearing, until there's an appeals hearing, you don't use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| Well, we don't spend any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| Where's that $12,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9065)|
| 2:31:06| Could we use that toward the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| I was going to ask John, is that in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9068)|
| 2:31:21| Yeah, when we approved it, it was last budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| So I don't know what's approved for this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| Yeah, this would be included in outside counsel for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9086)|
| 2:31:30| The law director has expressed some reservations that it may not be enough money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9090)|
| 2:31:36| but that's where it would be paid from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| We have a motion on the floor to defer it to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9105)|
| 2:31:46| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| Resolution 901 is approving an amendment to the Gay Street Redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9114)|
| 2:31:59| and Urban Renewal Plan and providing tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9119)|
| 2:32:05| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9125)|
| 2:32:06| Any comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9126)|
| 2:32:07| Voted 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9129)|
| 2:32:10| 9-1 to approve, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9136)|
| 2:32:17| Yes, someone here to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9137)|
| 2:32:22| No, I don't need you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| I need someone from KCDC or someone who looks out for the city's redevelopment plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9145)|
| 2:32:34| I think we've talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9154)|
| 2:32:35| Good evening, Don Peterson, KCDC 901 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| Don, thank you for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9158)|
| 2:32:39| Can you tell me, and I think we ask these questions in intergovernmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9159)|
| 2:32:44| at what point is Gay Street going to become unblotted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9164)|
| 2:32:47| How many buildings up there have been remodeled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9167)|
| 2:32:52| And with the 300 jobs, how many are going to be during the construction phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9172)|
| 2:32:58| and how many are going to be permanent after the construction phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9178)|
| 2:33:02| And what salary will they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| If you're talking about cafeteria workers, I'm sure they're not six figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| So if you can start out with those two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| Question number two, I'll defer to Mr. Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| But question number one, we handed out, if you have in your packet earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9195)|
| 2:33:21| this policy and communications department should have gave you a summary of the tax increment projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9201)|
| 2:33:28| And if you look at that, you will see the projects that were identified on Gay Street, where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9208)|
| 2:33:36| And right now, I couldn't give you an inventory on every building on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9216)|
| 2:33:45| I don't want to interrupt you, but I'm trying to speed things along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| Is there been like a plan that KCDC or the city of Knoxville have went down both sides of Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9229)|
| 2:33:56| and said, these are the buildings we want to fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9236)|
| 2:33:59| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| The plan encompasses the whole Gay Street area from basically, I think, Main Street all the way up to Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9245)|
| 2:34:06| But has anybody done a plan saying at 90% this is not going to be blighted anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| Because it's kind of like buying in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| If you buy the best house in the subdivision, you're not going to get as much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9253)|
| 2:34:17| But if you buy the worst house and fix it up, you're going to recoup more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9257)|
| 2:34:22| So the people who came first are having to spend some money and maybe deserve tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9262)|
| 2:34:28| The people who come last when the buildings on each side of them are totally fixed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| and generating foot traffic and revenue downtown should you give the same person in the middle the same amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9272)|
| 2:34:40| Looking at this, we're $20 million in tips that not only city residents have public finance for, but also the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9280)|
| 2:34:49| And you look at the county side, probably for every dollar the county residents give up 75 cents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9289)|
| 2:34:55| and the city gives up a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9295)|
| 2:34:58| Without the county approving these tips, the city could not even make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| The numbers just would not let it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| So we've not had those dialogues with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9305)|
| 2:35:08| They just came over here to us and nobody tells us anything about these projects until they get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9308)|
| 2:35:15| And we see a piece of paper and we may see a picture from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| John, you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| I just want to let the record reflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| The city always includes me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| KCDC always gives me information, and I'm included in the discussion from the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| But do you have a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| I mean, can you approve things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9332)|
| 2:35:37| Of course the approval is here at the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9337)|
| 2:35:40| But as far as the whole background work and the whole thought process and does it make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| and the city doing their due diligence, I'm right there with them the whole way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9346)|
| 2:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| And we've asked you this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| What is the limit that Knox County can give out in public financing before we get into trouble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9353)|
| 2:36:01| And I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| We're going to have a discussion at some point, but we never have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| Every single project needs to make sense on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9365)|
| 2:36:10| This is a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| This is a good project, and it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| This one makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| So if I understand you, there's no limit to the county what we can give out in public financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9377)|
| 2:36:24| It's just we look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| If it's blighted, it's a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| What I'm saying is this one makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9388)|
| 2:36:31| You have to look at every single one on its own, and this one on its own makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9391)|
| 2:36:36| But is there going to be a time that you come down here to us, that somebody wants a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| and you come and say, guys, we just can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| It just doesn't make sense for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| We're at a limit that's going to break the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| I've seen some TIF applications, and I felt that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9406)|
| 2:36:50| But you're getting to decide if they're good or bad for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| I have an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9418)|
| 2:36:59| So all you're having is opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| Now, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| I'll speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9423)|
| 2:37:08| I'm Madeline Weil, and I live at 2157 Hillsborough Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| and I'm the Deputy Director of Policy and Communications for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9432)|
| 2:37:17| It's not as if there's a pot of county money that is allocated for TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9437)|
| 2:37:22| Each project that has a TIF creates new tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| and it's those future tax revenues that are allocated to pay off the TIF loan that comes as a part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9446)|
| 2:37:35| As Mr. Troyer stated, the city has a process where we do include the county in reviewing each project on a project-by-project basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9455)|
| 2:37:46| And if we elect to recommend a TIF to county commission and to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9466)|
| 2:37:52| it's because that project has held up on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| It has been shown that it's worthy of public financing assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9476)|
| 2:38:02| according to the process that we've set up, which is a very strong one, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9482)|
| 2:38:07| So nobody has a plan at what time and what percentage of a redevelopment area is redeveloped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9487)|
| 2:38:16| I mean, it could be the very last building that hasn't been fixed up that could get a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9496)|
| 2:38:21| It actually could be the very last building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| and the reason is because the TIF is intended to fill a development gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9503)|
| 2:38:28| That is the gap between the cost of the project and then the revenues that are able to be assessed from the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9508)|
| 2:38:36| And so the gap is as much a factor of the project costs as it is in those future revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9516)|
| 2:38:45| So yes, as property values rise, those revenues go up, but in many cases the development costs also go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9525)|
| 2:38:52| And so that gap, while it may shrink over time, it may, depending on the project, never fully close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9532)|
| 2:38:58| And so that's why we really have to assess each project on its own terms every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9538)|
| 2:39:03| rather than looking at the redevelopment area as a whole and saying, well, okay, we're 75% of the way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9543)|
| 2:39:09| It just doesn't work that way because those last buildings may be the very hardest buildings to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9549)|
| 2:39:15| In fact, they probably are because they're the last ones to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9559)|
| 2:39:20| Next question is, if you represented the people I represent in North Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9560)|
| 2:39:24| what is the benefit for me to vote for public financing for this downtown for a cafeteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9564)|
| 2:39:30| Is it really going to increase business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| Is it going to increase revenue downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| If you're talking about lunch and dinner, you have the bistro, you have the lunch box, you have the brewery, you have Regus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9574)|
| 2:39:41| you have Tomato Head, you have the Pub World, something Gato.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9581)|
| 2:39:47| Are you just swapping customers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9587)|
| 2:39:50| Are you going to tell me that there's going to be a bunch of new customers come just for the S&W?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9590)|
| 2:39:55| We really believe that as downtown develops, we do have new customers coming into downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9595)|
| 2:40:00| and the CBID data supports that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| The benefits for people in North Knoxville are, I think, just the same, not Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9604)|
| 2:40:10| are the same really as the benefits for folks in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| Knox County residents come downtown, and they enjoy all the restaurants that you just named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9613)|
| 2:40:19| and the entertainment venues and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| This particular project, you've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9622)|
| 2:40:26| There's a gap tooth on Gay Street, and it's these three buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| It's right next to the new downtown cinema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| It's right next to a lot of the redevelopment that has happened over the past couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| and these three buildings still sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| They are blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| They are empty because they're very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| This project will bring the S&W back to life, the athletic house, the WRL building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| and will fill in that gap, essentially turning a space on Gay Street that is the next best thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9649)|
| 2:40:58| to something that's a done project and put it back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9658)|
| 2:41:04| The developers have estimated there's going to be about a $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9664)|
| 2:41:09| Am I getting this right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| $531,000 bump in sales tax revenue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| And as you know, a good chunk of that comes to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9674)|
| 2:41:16| So you're guaranteeing me $531,000 in new sales tax for inside the city for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9676)|
| 2:41:24| Yeah, I think I'm going to yield to John Craig, the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| Okay, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| Are you going to make that pledge to me there's going to be a half a million in new sales tax revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| John Craig, 12226 Brighton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| Commissioner Moore, as we discussed the other day, we are asked as part of this application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| which is then reviewed by the city and the county before it's even brought to a vote by these bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9699)|
| 2:41:44| we're asked to estimate the number of jobs, both part-time and full-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9704)|
| 2:41:50| both during construction and during lease-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| And we're also asked to estimate additional sales tax revenue and other benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| We're also asked to talk about green building practices and a number of other things that are ancillary to the basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9718)|
| 2:42:05| Okay, to try to speed things along, how many jobs are you going to create during construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9725)|
| 2:42:09| What we have estimated is that there are approximately 200 jobs associated with construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| and 140 jobs related to the businesses after the project is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9733)|
| 2:42:18| And what do you project to pay for these employees to be at 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| We do not have a projection for what those jobs will pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| Would you project that someone at S&W would make a six-figure income?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9743)|
| 2:42:28| Again, we don't have any projection for any of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9748)|
| 2:42:31| At this point, we don't have an accurate idea of exactly who's going to fill the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9751)|
| 2:42:37| We may end up having a, you know, arbitrage company where, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9757)|
| 2:42:42| everybody in the business makes, you know, half a million dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9762)|
| 2:42:46| We might have a five and dime where most of the workers make minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| At this point, it's unknown and unknowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| So you're asking for a TIF that we don't know what you're going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9773)|
| 2:42:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9777)|
| 2:42:58| We know you're going to fix the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9778)|
| 2:42:59| And that's what it's based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9781)|
| 2:43:02| I mean, I gave Joe here last month or so a hard time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| and I told him this is the last TIF I'm voting on because the people that I represent in North Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9785)|
| 2:43:10| in high school, they, too, drive past blighted areas, very blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9790)|
| 2:43:15| And we've had one TIF out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| John, do we use through the housing authority the same statute that we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| that the city uses through KCDC through our Knox Housing Authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9803)|
| 2:43:30| You're asking a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| There's other avenues besides KCDC to do a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| Has this administration went after blight in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9815)|
| 2:43:42| In what way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| Well, I'm talking about you can take out in my district the Black Oak Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9824)|
| 2:43:49| The grass is past your hips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9829)|
| 2:43:53| You've got 50 trailers that just fell off the frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9833)|
| 2:43:59| You've got an old motel that the roofs fell in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| And people drive by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9842)|
| 2:44:03| And I would think that's blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| Have we had a developer who has made a proposal to make a significant investment in that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9846)|
| 2:44:15| But I'm asking you a specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| With Mr. Craig here, what he proposes is right now we're collecting zero property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| zero in county tax dollars and property tax dollars right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| So is that out in hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| During the TIF, the county is going to collect $6,497.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9866)|
| 2:44:32| And once the TIF is through, the county is going to collect $52,950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| But I hear we go dancing again, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| I'm going to just ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| Do you all use or do you know about an authority of the state statute that we could cure blight in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9877)|
| 2:44:44| I think there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| And, you know, if there were a developer, I understand that there might be a developer that lives in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9885)|
| 2:44:51| that might be interested in an investment in that particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9891)|
| 2:44:56| And I think it would be good for that investor to make a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9896)|
| 2:45:00| But is there an avenue to go through the Knox Housing Partnership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| Because they seem to tell everybody that they don't want to be in that business is what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9903)|
| 2:45:08| So do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| I don't want to answer for Knox Housing Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9910)|
| 2:45:13| Do we have members to a board over there, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9913)|
| 2:45:18| I'm just asking if the administration is in conversations with the board members of Knox Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9918)|
| 2:45:25| to talk about curing blight in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| I think that would be a great discussion to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9928)|
| 2:45:30| But I think what we're here tonight is on a particular proposal that you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9930)|
| 2:45:35| And we're getting off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| The agenda is to propose this TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| And does this TIF make sense for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| Right now the county collects no property taxes under the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9942)|
| 2:45:46| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9946)|
| 2:45:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| First of all, I want to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| I thought there was a reason that I voted against this in the finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9953)|
| 2:45:58| It's because it's a 20-year TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| I think these TIFs, we shouldn't exceed 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| I don't think we've ever did one longer than that since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| But, Mr. Peterson, I want to ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9967)|
| 2:46:12| We have people coming down here from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| and they talk about how hot and valuable this property is on Gay Street, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9975)|
| 2:46:20| and what all it's worth and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| How can you consider something like that blighted if it's that valuable and worth the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9982)|
| 2:46:28| I don't know how we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| Now, I realize these buildings are dilapidated and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9990)|
| 2:46:33| but if it's that valuable, it looks like these developers could put this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9993)|
| 2:46:39| and make the figures work out if that property is that valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=9999)|
| 2:46:44| Again, I would answer that question and go back to what is blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10004)|
| 2:46:48| and what constitutes blight and why these buildings have not been developed to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10008)|
| 2:46:53| And if it goes back to the reason that it's quite considerable cost and considerable risk, that is the reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10013)|
| 2:47:03| I'm going to withdraw my motion, and I'm going to make another motion to approve this on a 15-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10023)|
| 2:47:13| Mr. Chair, does the second have to concur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10033)|
| 2:47:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| He'd have to get a new second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10041)|
| 2:47:27| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10051)|
| 2:47:34| Oh, you've got that chart here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10054)|
| 2:47:37| Yes, the second does have to concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| I think he's got a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10059)|
| 2:47:42| No, I don't concur with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10062)|
| 2:47:51| The second has to concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| Concur to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10074)|
| 2:47:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10076)|
| 2:47:57| Would you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| He made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10079)|
| 2:48:00| Just make a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10080)|
| 2:48:01| And now he wants to withdraw his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10081)|
| 2:48:02| He can't do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| We've been doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10088)|
| 2:48:09| I'm the last chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10091)|
| 2:48:12| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10092)|
| 2:48:13| I'd make a substitute motion that we approve it with a 15-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| That'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| Can you make a substitute for a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10103)|
| 2:48:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10104)|
| 2:48:25| Rick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| Mr. Luke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10107)|
| 2:48:28| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10108)|
| 2:48:29| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part2?start=10109)|
