| 0:11:12| Mr. Chairman I did get a call from the fire inspector when he was on the premises and he was speaking with the current ownership and they did tell him that this owner or this applicant was not going to purchase the business and they called me later and I asked that they send me that in writing but I haven't received anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=672)|
| 0:11:29| Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed no. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=689)|

| 0:12:08| Likewise do you want to tell about your event coming up? Well it's the Taste of East Tennessee. It's this Saturday. We're down at World's Fairgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=728)|
| 0:12:19| It's going to be a good event. I think we have about 27 restaurants that are signed in with it and, of course, Benefit Casa is one of the beneficiaries of this and Sertoma Charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=739)|
| 0:12:28| So hopefully it will be a good turnout. We're a little bit anxious because we've got the, quote, Knox Rocks or something right next door to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| Maybe that will help us. I don't know. Hopefully the weather will be good. I just want to comment. I went last year. It was great fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| And it's for a wonderful cause. And thank you so much for supporting Casa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=763)|

| 0:13:25| Hello again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| H.P. Patel, 2033 Fallhaven, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| No applicable record on three of the applicants. Mr. Jaden Patel has a seldom minor, 11-8-06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=820)|
| 0:13:50| He received a $50 fine, 11 months, 29 days, suspended on judicial diversion. And it's still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=830)|
| 0:14:00| We still need the building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, health department approval and task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| When are you wanting to open, sir? You're over near the new Baskin Robbins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=847)|
| 0:14:18| Yes. May 7th-ish is our target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| When do you intend to get all these shortcomings addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| Maybe, actually, maybe even Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| Most of our work is complete tomorrow. If we get everything done and we can call inspection on time, we should be able to call some of them in Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=876)|
| 0:14:44| And every time we open a restaurant, we've had to bring the inspections later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| This is our third time in the city. We just have a few issues here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| Mr. Swanson, can you help out a layperson here with the judicial diversion and the pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| What those things mean in terms of our authority here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| He was granted judicial diversion. That would mean that there would not be a conviction on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| and he would have to make sure that he doesn't get a conviction, and if those are completed, then the charge will be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=920)|
| 0:15:29| Is that what pending means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| I assume that's what pending means is that all of the requirements to complete diversion have not yet been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| Officer Huskey, can you tell us more about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| The diversion starts on January the 18th, and it runs for 11 months and 29 days from that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| And if he meets all the requirements at the end of that, then it will be dismissed upon cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=954)|
| 0:16:04| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| I'll just speak for myself. I guess I have trouble with someone who has a sale to minor, although it's been diverted, if that's the right verb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=968)|
| 0:16:17| The term of the diversion is still pending, and so, in my mind, that is still an issue hanging over this gentleman's head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| regarding his involvement in an operation that's going to be selling alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| So I have trouble with the approval of this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| Councilman Boehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| What is Yeaton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| He's a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| Besides being an owner, what's his role going to be in the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| He's a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| He's a partner in the Kirky Creek location in which he's running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| He's ABC and everything's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| I mean, he's still able to serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| One's at Kingston Pike, one's at Kirky Creek, and this will be your third in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| Third in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| You know what the concern is here that we're talking about with this pending, the seriousness of him selling alcohol and what our concern is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1063)|
| 0:17:52| What is the concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| We know that he has potentially a violation, you know, something pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| Of course, I'm not going to need to think about it, but, you know, he's innocent until proven guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| Is that sort of correct or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| But anyway, do you have any response to the concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| We do, and it's been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| We do all we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| You know, we have three restaurants, and this is the first time anything like that has happened in two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| We do take this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1120)|
| 0:18:47| We actually started IDing everybody, but we had a few 75-year-olds that really got ticked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| And I would just wish that we would just pass a law to ID everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| That would make our job a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| But, you know, he's currently actively involved as a manager selling beer and alcohol, and I don't see how this is any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Officer Husky, do you have any facts with regards to the circumstances of the sale to the minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| It seems like it was not very long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| I know precisely what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| It was an undercover cop came in, and he had a minor accompany him and asked for a drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| So JT, which is the initials for the gentleman here, the one person who actually sat down at the bar and asked for a drink was old enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1178)|
| 0:19:49| And he served a drink, and the other person with him also asked for a drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| It was an assumption that if he's accompanying this person, you know, it was a false assumption, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| But that other person happened to be a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| Did you happen to go to court with JT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| I did not, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| He's been almost a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| But, you know, ABC, I think, did the sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Let me ask you this, Officer Husky, in your discussion with General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| Did they indicate to you the status of this particular judicial diversion being one that the guilty plea is being held in abeyance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1232)|
| 0:20:41| subject to him completing judicial diversion, then this will be expunged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| Or did they have it just as open, an open judicial diversion where there was no guilty plea down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| and just waiting for him to do everything he needs to do in 11 months and 29 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| And the way they explained that to me was that he didn't plead guilty to the sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| more or less plead guilty to the diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| And at the end of that diversion, which would be, I guess, 118 of 08,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| it would be dismissed as long as he meets all the requirements and pays the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| And I can explain the underage sting we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| I think, and this is a sidebar here in the future, and this is not something we've never thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| I just thought about this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| When we have something like this, since those are public records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| it might be good to get a copy for the beer board to attach to of the actual warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| On the warrant, it would talk about what the criteria was and whether or not there actually was a guilty plea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| and if it's a judicial diversion subject to what the criteria is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Because sometimes they have them enter guilty, but they just don't enter into the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| and then judicial diversion, it gets expunged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| And other times there is no plea entered and they go into the diversionary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| So sometimes that would be good to have that information in the future, just have a copy of that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| My question was going to be to ask you to tell us about the sting and the location in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| I was interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| I actually participated in that sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| I'm trying to remember exactly which one it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| I believe it was Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| But I'm not sure if I went in, but the officer goes in with the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| The cadet orders both drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| The officer doesn't order the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| That way there's no confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| So the cadet orders both drinks, and he served them both drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Councilman Huffleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Well, we may need to get an opinion from Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| I know he's in the middle of a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| I took it to mean that we treat this as a conviction until the diversion is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1371)|
| 0:22:59| I asked him that question just momentarily a little while ago, so you can ask him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| Well, I don't want to get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| Yeah, that's why I'd like to get him to answer that question so everyone can hear the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| What was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| Is this a conviction right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| No, it is not a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Is it grounds for denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| I was going to make a, there are about, what, four to six inspections that still haven't been done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| And since there is some concern by members of council, I was going to move to postpone to allow them to get all those inspections in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1413)|
| 0:23:41| because it seems to be a lot more than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| And if, you know, allow Mr. Patel to come in if members of council want to talk to him about what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| but base the motion to postpone on the many inspections that are still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| This is our third city bureau permit application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| and this is the third time that we have not had these inspections complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| It's very difficult for us to have these complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| We're relying on inspectors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| You know, we can't just say, hey, come on in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| They're fairly busy, as you guys know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| I mean, Knoxville is not a slow town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| And if we call a premature inspection, it's very difficult for us to recall them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| It's extremely difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| And at all times have I provided Ms. Day with everything she needs very in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1470)|
| 0:24:38| And I don't see that's a big issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Would you repeat what is outstanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| It's the building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, health department approval, and task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| Actually, none of the inspections or the tasks, none of it has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| None of the inspections nor the task training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| The task training we've done a couple of times, I guess, already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| It needs to be done for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Is the idea for the postponement so that you could talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| It allows them to get everything taken care of, get their alcohol classes taken care of under their belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1522)|
| 0:25:34| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| Oh, it was the old light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| You know, I just would like to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| Hearing you discuss how you handle your policy or lack of, I guess maybe I'd say lack of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1544)|
| 0:25:52| in regard to how you determine who you're going to serve and who you ID and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| I think that task training could be extremely helpful to you and all your locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| and a real strong consideration of how you're going to handle serving because it's already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| I am not as concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| I mean, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Well, we are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| And I understand what we represent also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| You know, we are also a business that not only represent, you know, you guys, I guess, in this alcohol matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1579)|
| 0:26:27| but we are just as concerned as you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| And the stuff that needs to task stuff, I mean, we have no problem doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| We're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| I don't see a reason for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| We can finish that and turn that into Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| You know, it's very difficult for us to come back out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| We're right when we're ready to open restaurant, right in the middle of opening, you know, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| I did want to say while this is not grounds for denial of the permit at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| should something happen and this person not complete the necessary elements of the diversion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| he would then have a conviction entered against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| That would, in fact, serve as an appropriate basis for revocation of the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| because no one is permitted to hold a permit who has a conviction for any of these alcohol-related offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1635)|
| 0:27:24| Mr. Swanson, how will that information route back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| The city court, whenever they have a conviction of that sort, is supposed to notify the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| It's supposed to be a means by which we would be apprised of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| There is. It's in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Yeah, just to say I'm going to be voting against the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| I don't think this is enough grounds to hold them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| I think we've passed plenty of them that have had far less stuff done, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| Councilman Rawley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Mr. Becker, my concern is with the task certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| I understand the problem with getting the inspectors out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| but the task certification is just a non-starter for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| And that is critically important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| especially given the business history of the one owner in this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1686)|
| 0:28:16| The motion before us is to postpone to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1705)|

| 0:30:38| I hope you'll all be able to attend the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| It is May the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| It's our first ever attempt at fundraising for the animal center, and we are very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| The event is going very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| The highlight of the event, including dinner, will be a live auction of 19 dog houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| and cat houses that have been built by area contractors, architects, artists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| and some students from the School of Interior Design at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1861)|

| 0:31:11| Ah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Yeah, but not by him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| My staff told me that I should not use that terminology, and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| no, it'll get the event some attention, and so we're going to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| And so it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| As long as you don't also have a bunny ranch out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1884)|

| 0:32:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| The council will remember this came up, I guess, maybe last beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| and I actually made the motion based on the wealth of evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| the wealth of information that was not put on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| Mr. Welch came to see me on a couple of occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| and basically fell on the sword and said that he really, really didn't intend to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| He was sorry he was going to go down and get a full, complete pickup of everything he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| I know he's met a couple of times downtown here to make sure that his application has everything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| What I told Mr. Welch was, well, if you were to do all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| it's up to council and up to the beer board to determine whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| or not they want to grant you a beer license and that he need to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| and make a statement to the beer board to see if the beer board felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| or thought that his statement was such that they would want to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| and would want to give him a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| So that is why he is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| He asked for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| He corrected his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| He came to me very sincerely, you know, and said that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| while it was an awful lot of things, little misdemeanors and things of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| that he just didn't realize he needed to put it all on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| And that's up to this beer board to determine his veracity in that state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| And so he's here today to kind of explain to council what happened last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| why it wasn't on there, and to see if you're willing to entertain a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| with regards to his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| I'm very sorry, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Just a lot of things I just didn't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| And I wish they had known I would have put it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| I was thinking about felonies, and I wasn't thinking about the misdemeanors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| and I'm really sorry I messed up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| That's the reason why I ended up putting the wrong thing on there, and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| And I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Have we been out there since the last beer hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| to make sure that he's not selling any beer or doing anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| I have been out there since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| What have you perceived?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| He did have beer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| He had it in the back covered up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| He had his containers locked up where he couldn't sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| And he told me he was coming back to the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| so I instructed him to keep it under lock and key until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| I invite the beer board to ask him any questions they want to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| I do think that it is good that we've been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| and that you haven't been selling beer in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| You know, we've had situations before where folks tend to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| and so I think that's a plus for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| But there's an awful lot of things here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| and while none of them would fall under the applicable record component of the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2090)|
| 0:34:58| there is a lot of information there that this beer board needs to feel comfortable about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| I will say that based on what he's told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| and based on what he's done over the last couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| I do think he's sincere and I do think he's going to try hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| It goes a long way with me that he hasn't been selling any beer over the last two, three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| because it's very easy to do that where the place is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| He knows exactly where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| He could very easily do that and kind of move on, but he didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| and I don't think he even attempted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| So I invite the beer board to ask any questions of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| Mr. Welch, how long have you owned that business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| Three months, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| And I try to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| I'm trying to be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| I'm trying to, you know, forget about my past and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| You know, put the Lord in my life first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| I'm sorry, whatever I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| How's it going without selling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| People being respectful of your position that you cannot sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Yes, and it's going fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| I mean, I've had a few people, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| I sell a lot more cigarettes than I do beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Mr. Welch, do you have any sort of plans for the building, for the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| hopes, where you want to see it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| What's your vision for the location there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Yes, well, I plan on putting a deli in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| and after I put the deli in, I hope to go a lot further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| And I'm trying to keep it straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| Or legal, as you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| Have you got a business plan on the deli?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Oh, yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Have you been working with SCORE or anybody sort of helping develop the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| I've talked to the health inspector, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| I mean, well, I guess it's health inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Health inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Mr. Swanson, we don't have any grounds for denying this, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| None that I have observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| No, Mr. Welch, I'm going to make a motion to approve your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| I think it's a complete follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| I want you to know that, and you should expect that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| there's going to be periodic drop-bys, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| to make sure you're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| You know, I'm very concerned about that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| We've tried to do some redevelopment in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| I've expressed that to you, and I have great concerns about the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| I want to make sure that you're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| You tell me you're going to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| I know some people who know you who tell me that they believe you're trying to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| But I'm going to make a motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| but I want you to know and understand that at any day and any time you may be under observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| and you have a steam come through and you need to operate accordingly, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| if this beer board approves your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| So I'm going to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2289)|
| 0:38:18| Councilman Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Yes, I have a procedural question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| I know at council a defeated proposal can't come back for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Is there no such provision at beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| No, you can go back and file a new application whenever and start the process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2308)|
| 0:38:40| Another procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Does the issuance of a beer permit require five votes or a majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Five votes is a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Well, I mean, does it require or can it pass on a vote of one to nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| It takes five affirmative votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Do the right thing, Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| They tell me one day at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Members of the beer board, at your place tonight is a flyer about Not in My Backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| It's a complimentary invitation to an event coming up on the 3rd of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| and Catherine Brunson, Executive Director of the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| is here this evening as she and her staff always are monitoring the proceedings of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| And she would like to tell us a little bit more about the statistics about particularly underage alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| and drug use in our community that will be presented at this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| And actually, just wanted to invite you all, make sure that you knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| This is our fourth edition of our community stats book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| It has a compilation of all kinds of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| We've got law enforcement data, both adult and youth, homeless, mortality and morbidity data, emergency room data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| It's about every way substance abuse impacts the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| We think it's very important to monitor it over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| This is our fourth edition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| We try to monitor it for improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| We try to look for the holes of where we need to work a little bit harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| And it impacts one in four citizens in our community, not just personally but economically as it impacts the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| We just invite you to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| We provide copies to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| I know in the last book we had about 43 grants that came to Knoxville based upon data that they got out of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| So that's one reason why we do the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| But we just really want you to know that we're measuring, always measuring and monitoring outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| And there's really not anything we do that we're not measuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| and trying to make sure that we're using our funding and our staffing as efficiently as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| And we thank you for always supporting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Ms. Benson, would you like to tell us about Ms. Armbruster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| Stephanie Armbruster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| Who's relatively new and what her work involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| She's hired a full-time epidemiologist on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| One goal was to put the stats book together, which she has very successfully done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| She's also set it up so that we can put out more editions more frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| So we'll be doing one at least every other year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| And she's evaluating all of our grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| You need to be careful where you say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| But certain evaluators in town take a large portion of small non-profit grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| And that is one reason why I hired an epidemiologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| One thing that we are doing with her now that the major task is finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| is I'm loaning her out to small groups that have to have an evaluation component for their grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| and don't have the funding to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| And so she's able to assist other groups with making sure they're monitoring outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| She's done a fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| She's going to present the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| And then we're going to have a panel of kind of experts from the different fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| We're thrilled to have the medical director of the emergency room at the University of Tennessee who's coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| and who says it's every single thing that walks in his door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| So it does impact all of us in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| We are just thrilled to have her, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| And she hopefully will be a resource to the community just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| So we just invite you to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| Council Member Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Actually, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| It didn't have to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Did your light have to do with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| And anything else, Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| I just wanted to very quickly ask council to please very as expeditiously as possible get back to council staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| about the new proposed date for our Brear Board workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| We've been bouncing it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| And the problem is we are committed, and I've talked to Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| we are committed to trying to make sure we have 100% attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| So we need to find a date that everybody can be there for a good period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| and hopefully the June 28th I think is the next date it looks like we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| So please very quickly get back to staff so we can go ahead and get that taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Yeah, this is actually on the same subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I feel really embarrassed that it's taking us until June 28th to get this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| I think this is something we talked about doing last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| I think we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| I think we continue to struggle over some simple issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| I was going to ask if people have their calendars here, if we can look at dates that aren't a Thursday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| because obviously it's a long time until we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| And if we can find another space, I'd like to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2620)|
| 0:43:48| Another evening would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| My concern about waiting until June 28th, and I agree that we all must be in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| I think that's crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| But my concern is that we're going to have a situation arise where we really needed to have had some council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| and some opportunity to formulate some policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| And I'm very concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| I believe that's a little over two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| That means two more billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| Perhaps three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| It would be difficult for me to do it today because I don't have my full calendar with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| So if you've got some dates you want to suggest, maybe provide those to send in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| You can send out a myriad of dates and see how people feel about those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| Is there any other business that needs to come before the billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070424?start=2686)|
