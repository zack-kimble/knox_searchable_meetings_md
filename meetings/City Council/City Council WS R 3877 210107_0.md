| 0:00:30| I'm sure the time is 401. So we'll now go ahead and call the city council workshop to order for Thursday, January the 7th, 2021. Mr. Johnson, we will now have Council Member Roberto to give us the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=30)|

| 0:02:03| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| Seven present, Last Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| I know that Council Member Testerman did reach out to me to let me know that she had a conflict and would not be able to make it to the workshop today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=130)|
| 0:02:17| So, Council Members, thank you so much for joining today and Happy New Year to each of you and to our presenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| Today we have two presentations that we will be listening to and also have a question and answer session after each presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=143)|
| 0:02:31| After which we will have Council discussion if any additional discussion is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| Then we will have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| So, Mr. Johnson, do we have anyone signed up for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| Last Mayor, we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| In that case, I will not need to go over our public forum guidelines that we ask that anyone calling in needs to adhere to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| So, with that said, I want to take this opportunity to thank our presenters for today, Mr. Zimbabwe Mutabu and Brian Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=174)|
| 0:03:04| So, we're going to go ahead and start with the first presentation, which is the State of the Black Community, a Culture in Decline, Rescue and Restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=184)|
| 0:03:12| Mr. Mutabu, if you will, I will go ahead and turn the call over to you now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| City Council persons, Vice Mayor Gwen McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| We are grateful that we're together convened this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=207)|
| 0:03:35| The first of the areas disseminated by Knoxville Urban Renewal Project is the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=215)|
| 0:03:47| The remainder was Morningside and Mountain View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| Those were the three areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| I am Zimbabwe Umatavo, born in the bottom, securely embraced by Mount Calvary Baptist Church, warmly hugged and taught at high school school, and guided judiciously by parents and neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=235)|
| 0:04:17| That community, the bottom, prepared me for the task pending, the reclamation of the African American culture that would be upended and asphyxiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=257)|
| 0:04:34| That task obligated a lifetime, nine city of Knoxville administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=274)|
| 0:04:48| Submitted to you November last is a document, African American neighborhoods commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=288)|
| 0:05:00| Again, African American neighborhoods commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| Submitted therein is a straightforward portrayal of community, vis-a-vis the city of Knoxville and the cultural status at which we find ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=308)|
| 0:05:31| The place at which we landed in this social and economic environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=331)|
| 0:05:41| Offered within the documents are the precise routes the city should travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| Not meander, but travel with urgency to reach a place where Black people are profiting equally from all that Knoxville avails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=347)|
| 0:06:02| Here are the areas of concentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| KCDC, gentrification, eminent domain, public policy, and the office of Title VI compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=365)|
| 0:06:21| This began with the office of Title VI compliance because I think it is the easiest, the simplest, to get started and get us moving toward our destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=381)|
| 0:06:41| Prior to a Supreme Court decision, J.A. Croson versus the state of Virginia, the city of Richmond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=401)|
| 0:07:01| cities and states somewhat had a free hand in trying to come up with some way to redress decades, if not centuries, of the disparities found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=421)|
| 0:07:17| with the expenditures of public money to African Americans vis-a-vis white, mostly male, business enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=437)|
| 0:07:33| After this Supreme Court decision and specific directions therein, some places across the country proceeded to develop disparity studies that gave in detail two things primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=453)|
| 0:07:59| The nature of the disparities and procedures to be used to end these disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=479)|
| 0:08:13| And the court said that this process was prerequisite to ever even considering set-asides, but you had to proceed according to this dictate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=493)|
| 0:08:35| Knoxville proceeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| In 1997, the disparity study was complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| The Knoxville City Council accepted the disparity study and its recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| A Title VI office was established with the express purpose of implementing the disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=534)|
| 0:09:08| And some were hopeful that finally the gap could be narrowed and ultimately completely abolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=548)|
| 0:09:19| One thing happened at the beginning of this year, and that is that the office of Title VI compliance was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=559)|
| 0:09:32| Now, let me say here that was mostly a symbolic act, because even though the office was established, it had not ever been sufficiently staffed or given the authority and responsibility necessary for its establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=572)|
| 0:10:02| For bringing into line the departments within the city of Knoxville that could have made a difference had they been maximizing an effort to end the disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=602)|
| 0:10:18| So during those years, the effort had been made on the part of us in the community to get the office staffed and to get that office elevated to a department level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=618)|
| 0:10:37| so as the director of that office would be responsible to the mayor of the city directly and only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=637)|
| 0:10:49| Because that never happened, the office never had impact, and because the office never had impact, another study was authorized by the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=649)|
| 0:11:09| That study was done, and it too found enormous disparities, some cases broader than the disparities initially discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=669)|
| 0:11:24| And accompanying that study was a specific document outlining for the city of Knoxville approaches to be taken that could finally get us on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=684)|
| 0:11:49| That document is increasing business with minority-owned, women-owned, and small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=709)|
| 0:11:59| Again, the effort was made to study the situation, a document developed on what is the proper approach, and again also negligence or indifference relative to the implementation of what was recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=719)|
| 0:12:30| What we are recommending as a first but significant step toward correction is the establishment, or may I say the re-establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=750)|
| 0:12:51| of the Office of Title VI Compliance, in conjunction with that office, and in contrast with the last effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=771)|
| 0:13:05| that that office, in order to be efficient, be fortified with a sufficient staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=785)|
| 0:13:20| We believe that the staff would need three officers and access to an attorney from the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=800)|
| 0:13:34| whose primary responsibility would be to assist that office along the lines of what is needed for full application of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=814)|
| 0:13:53| We also think that in order to give that office efficacy, understanding that its duty, its chore, to be to oversee, to monitor the entire city government structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=833)|
| 0:14:12| that it be elevated to a full department within the city of Knoxville structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=852)|
| 0:14:25| This elevation would mean automatically that the director would have the cache, would have the gravitas, to better influence what is those departments over which it would be monitoring and supervising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=865)|
| 0:14:46| This director would report directly to the mayor. That proximity to the mayor would even further give cache to the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=886)|
| 0:15:01| And we are convinced that that would be a move in which we could immediately find that a difference is being made in the expenditures of city of Knoxville dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=901)|
| 0:15:21| and the enrichment of African American enterprise located and working within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=921)|
| 0:15:32| That is, again, the reestablishment of the Title VI Office of Compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=932)|
| 0:15:43| We think that the situation that's facing the African American community is so broad in its negative ramifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=943)|
| 0:16:07| that there would have to be a full-scale approach toward redress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| There would be other areas that are focused upon in concert to bring about a real change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=975)|
| 0:16:27| KCDC must be focused upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| Gentrification and the strong tendency that is taking place in Knoxville now must be focused upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=993)|
| 0:16:44| Eminent domain as a method to reverse the damage of urban renewal must be focused upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1004)|
| 0:16:57| And, of course, we think essential is a simple but strong announced public policy that will be distributed not only across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1017)|
| 0:17:14| but placed openly in every department head's office that states that the city of Knoxville has aligned itself with an effort to use all of its resources and influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1034)|
| 0:17:39| to correct damage done to the African American culture, and it expects its department heads, those directors, to align themselves to this effort without hesitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1059)|
| 0:18:00| We think that kind of policy, clearly stated, disseminated, would give muscle to this overall effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1080)|
| 0:18:15| It would give clarity to this overall effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| It would make it clear to all who listen that there is, in fact, a new way of doing things in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1100)|
| 0:18:33| And there is a population that has been neglected that now is getting the attention that it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1113)|
| 0:18:42| And this population will join us in the benefits that the city of Knoxville indeed can offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1122)|
| 0:18:55| Gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| It is clear to all that gentrification is indeed taking place in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1138)|
| 0:19:08| Gentrification, as these other problems, prevails across the entire country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1148)|
| 0:19:19| But we are offering Knoxville specific ways that we think that this can be arrested and ultimately prevented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1159)|
| 0:19:32| Six specific things we're offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| An investment in middle-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| The freezing and reduction of property taxes on existing homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| Based on income, eliminate and reduce taxes on senior homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| Block luxury develops in all of our at-risk neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| And do away with market rate developments in those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| Provide vouchers to low-income homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| And restrict pilots and TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| Use in the NBURB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| We think that the NBURB, which is Uptown Knoxville, has benefited enormously from pilots and TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1216)|
| 0:20:29| And that development will take place in those areas now without the ultimate incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1229)|
| 0:20:37| We do not think that that kind of incentive is necessary now to get folks to look at what space is left in and around the NBURB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1237)|
| 0:20:47| So concentrate on using those programs to develop the adjacent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1247)|
| 0:20:58| With an exception, if projects can be developed in the NBURB, that is in Uptown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1258)|
| 0:21:08| and those programs can be designed in a specific way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| that would give an enormous assistance to neighborhood people, primarily African American people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1273)|
| 0:21:22| through ownership, residential occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1282)|
| 0:21:31| Then we think that pilots and TIFs can be evaluated from that vantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| That is our way, one of the ways we can see gentrification being arrested and ultimately eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1298)|
| 0:21:49| Eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| That's a term that represents poison to many of us who've had firsthand experience with urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1314)|
| 0:22:09| because it was applied loosely to decimate the bottom, morningside, and mountain view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1329)|
| 0:22:22| However, we think that that concept can and should be used in order to return unused and underused land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1342)|
| 0:22:39| that's located particularly in the urban renewal areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| and in instances outside of the urban renewal areas when applicable to African Americans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1365)|
| 0:22:54| in order to begin developing a foundation for the reemergence of the African American economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1374)|
| 0:23:03| stronger home ownership, and all those other amenities that land ownership brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1383)|
| 0:23:14| We think that the first concentration should be on the bottom, the first area acquired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1394)|
| 0:23:24| and where development is now taking place that's adjacent to the proposed minor league baseball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1404)|
| 0:23:39| Those areas are indeed the areas in which we hope that there will be concentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1419)|
| 0:23:51| Again, we hope that you as city council persons read and evaluated the material that was submitted to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1431)|
| 0:24:02| And here today, we hope that we will take this time to further explain where explanation is needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1442)|
| 0:24:13| to answer questions where answers are needed, and to explore even better ways to finally bring about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1453)|
| 0:24:23| the kind of effort needed by a city to bring about corrections to the plight of an African American population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1463)|
| 0:24:37| So with that, Vice Mayor Gwen, I return it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| Thank you very much. And thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| I know that this is something that you've worked on for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Council, I think that everyone did receive the packet or maybe multiple packets from Mr. Mutabu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| regarding this information in the culture and decline and rescue and restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| Do we have any questions regarding the information that was shared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| Councilman Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| Mr. Johnson, is there anything you can do to assist her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| Councilman Fugate, can you repeat that? Councilman Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| Yeah, I think it's on my end. My question, I think, can y'all hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Okay, thank you. This may not be specifically about some of that, but can someone talk to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| I see Ms. Gill is on the call. Or someone talk to me about exactly the Title VI office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1560)|
| 0:26:10| How are we doing Title VI? If somebody can shed a little light on that for me, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1570)|
| 0:26:19| Certainly, and good afternoon, Council. Erin Gill, the Office of Independent American Indian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| and appreciate the opportunity to listen in on this workshop today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Very interesting for me to hear some of that history and realize the importance of Title VI in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1589)|
| 0:26:40| that it is a critical function of what the Office of Community Empowerment does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| As you have heard, and as many of you know from past work with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| Title VI is obviously a legal obligation that we have. We cannot not comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1610)|
| 0:27:00| That being said, I think, as I heard Mr. Matabu mention today, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| it's also incumbent that we think beyond the strict compliance-based thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| and really challenge the city, challenge our community, challenge our departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| to think about equity and inclusion in a much broader sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| So, with that said, I did want to make sure that Council knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| that Tasha Harris is and has long been our Title VI coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| She sits in the mayor's suite on the sixth floor and works directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| her actual office is right across from where our law suite is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| So, she does have both direct access to the mayor as well as to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| She works hand-in-hand with other departmental representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| Each department has a Title VI representative who is in charge of ensuring compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| with the various subcontracts that we engage in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| And Tasha acts as both a trainer and a compliance officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| to make sure that folks understand what those rules are and that they're being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| We create an annual Title VI report, and I believe I have to check with Tasha| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| as to whether or not that's been fully published yet for 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| but there's an annual reporting process that Tasha leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| And one of the interesting pieces of this work and part of why Tasha is involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| not just in that pure compliance element, but also in this broader work around equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| is that, you know, in the past, we have not had very many Title VI complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| Those cases do not come up very frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| And recognizing that capacity existed both with Tasha as well as other members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| of Community Empowerment to really think beyond, again, that strict compliance lens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| and think about the ways that we can advance equity and thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| how our services are being provided, not just from the standpoint of discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| Not just from the letter of that Title VI law, but really thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| how we can address those disparities that exist across our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| So that's very much part and parcel with what the Community Empowerment Office works on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| And again, wanting to clarify that that Title VI function is alive and well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| and Title VI coordinator held by Tasha Harris in that post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| I'll also just end on one point, and I think that this was brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| and I appreciate this perspective that, you know, it takes all of us to address equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| And I think that I would be remiss if I were to indicate that somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| this work is limited to one department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| It's really critical that all departments are thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| how we can provide equitable services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| how we make sure that we're scanning our own rules and policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| for ways that they may inadvertently prevent people from fully participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| in the services and programs that the city provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| And so that is a challenge that Mayor Kincannon poses to all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| not only just in leadership, but throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| so that we are all thinking across departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| about how we can advance those goals of equity and inclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| so it's not simply limited to one staff member having to carry that full burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| So thank you for that opportunity to comment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| Did that answer your question, Ms. Fuqua?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| I apologize, I went a little long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Yeah, you answered my question that yes, we still do Title VI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| and that we have somebody doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| But to your point about the continual evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| is there a formal process in place yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| I mean, I will give the administration a little grace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| in the fact that the first year was pretty much hijacked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| by dealing with the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| So as a new administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| when talking about looking at policies across departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| to make sure that we are doing what you just talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| has there been a formal protocol for doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Or is that being developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Or is that just kind of as people work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| they need to recognize these issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| I'll answer that piece in three parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| because I think when it comes to formal Title VI reporting and compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| that's been an ongoing effort for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| And yes, those processes are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| I'll also draw council's attention to some of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| that we've done with our purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| when it comes to intentional goal setting and reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| and really staffing to ensure that our departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| are very intentionally pursuing the goals we've set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| when it comes to contracting with diversity business enterprises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| including minority-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| And so that's been an area that has been very rigorously tracked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| and measured and quantified across departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| with mayor-level reporting biannually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| really mid-year as well as at the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| to report back and ensure that we are tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| toward the goals that we've set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Then on the other side of the hat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| we have been engaged with now for, I believe, three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| the Government Alliance on Race and Equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| which has been worked with in an internal equity committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| of city staffers who are looking at ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| that we can address that more intentional kind of laser-focused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| precise modification and identification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| really, of where these inadvertent barriers may exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| and targeting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| So that effort is newer, and so it does not have yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| the same rigor that we've applied within our purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| to address minority and other diversity business enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| But I do think that that's something that we all hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| to accomplish over the course of our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Councilwoman Fugate, does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Okay. Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| I just had a few follow-up questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| based on those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| You know, for Title VI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| and for other obligations that we have as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| under civil rights legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| it is not obvious how you might submit a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2009)|
| 0:33:38| if you feel like you've been discriminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| under something that would qualify under Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| There's nothing on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| I was really disappointed to see that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| essentially turned over investigations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| for fair housing complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| to the Human Rights Commission years ago, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| So it seems like we've had this trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| of not really committing any resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| and not doing the work that needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| to educate the community about their rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| and about how they access those resources through the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| not just when it comes to Title VI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| but when it comes to all of our civil rights obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| If someone were to file a Title VI complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| how would they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| That is something I'll have to get back to you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| I have just scanned our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| and you are right, Ms. Parker, it is not easy to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| So we will take a look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| and try to make that instructional language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| a bit more prominent on our page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| I think that's a suggestion that's well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| And another point of concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| and we discussed this earlier last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| in one of our city council dinners, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2101)|
| 0:35:09| But the fact that the Title VI office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| had a more prominent, not as prominent as needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| but more prominent placement on the organizational chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| and that was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Right now it is an asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| So it does not seem like the robust work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| that needs to be done to not only investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| claims of discrimination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| but then be proactive in addressing disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| difficult to achieve by one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| who is also the equity and inclusion officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| That's a concern of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| and I imagine that can be a concern of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| and seem like a closing of the Title VI office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| and an opening of the equity and inclusion office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| which has the Title VI coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| So I just wanted to clarify that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Council, do we have any other questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| comments to Council Member Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I want to thank Mr. Mutabu for speaking today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| I enjoyed reading this a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| and I actually got to read some of your childhood stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| from a dissertation from Dr. El-Amin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| and appreciated connecting those dots a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| to the work that you've done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| I wanted to ask a question specific to affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| and either Deputy Gill or I see Deputy Welch on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| Can you all talk through the city's philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| or policy or approach as it relates to rent freezing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| or maintaining low affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Thank you, Councilman Smith, and hello, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| It's good to see you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| So we have, you know, state laws that really restrict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| our ability to do, you know, rent control or rent freezing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Where we have been very effective in creating affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| in our city is through the Affordable Rental Development Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| And our Housing and Neighborhood Development Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| has been very strategic in partnering across the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| to create many, many units of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| And that is, in essence, I mean, we don't call it rent control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| but affordability periods are established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| Rent is based on income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| And that's been really our strategy for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| that allows us to work within state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| and still create affordability in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| That's just one piece of a larger housing strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| Of course, you know, we do assistance with home repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| You know, we have a big, we partner with KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| have invested tens of millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| in affordable housing options through our partnership with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| And we'll be looking forward to working with Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| over the coming months on plans to really even expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| some of our work around housing affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| So thank you for that question, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| And just, you know, I read about Mr. Matavu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| you referenced the loss of place in the article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| or the document that I read, and that, practically speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| affordable housing and some of these other things are helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| But that is a wound that takes generations to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Yes, Mr. Matavu, I enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| Thank you very much for the information that you sent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| I noticed in the, that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| you discussed East Knoxville and you discussed Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| I represent Lonsdale, which is one of the three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| I guess, primary African-American neighborhoods in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| Could you give me some, a summary of the situation in Lonsdale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| How might, how that might be the same or different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| from these other neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| Mr. Matavu, I had to mute you earlier due to some reverb issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| If you'll hit star six on your telephone, you can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2389)|
| 0:40:01| Okay. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| Yes, sir, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Lonsdale is a very integral part of the African-American community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2407)|
| 0:40:18| In the document, we spoke of zip codes 37915, 37914, 37921,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2418)|
| 0:40:32| and 21 is synonymous with Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| We spoke of those zip codes as representing the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| in Knoxville and Knox County that needs the most attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2443)|
| 0:40:53| In 1969, 77, 172, we concentrated heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2453)|
| 0:41:03| on the African-American population in Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| particularly because since its annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| there were still homes in Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| that had not been hooked up to the city sewerage system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| That's how neglected Lonsdale was then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| and of course, we still see Lonsdale as being neglected again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| because it's intimately connected to the overall African-American culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| Lonsdale was part of the Mechanicsville-Lonsdale-Beaumont project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2500)|
| 0:41:51| that we worked on diligently from 1969 to about 1978| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2511)|
| 0:42:00| because we were noticing that the poverty figures coming out of Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2520)|
| 0:42:12| the poverty figures coming out of Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| the poverty figures coming out of Beaumont| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| was being used by city government to get government funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| And once that funding was acquired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| we did not see the benefits of that funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| supporting those specific communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| And even today, Lonsdale, as it pertains to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2558)|
| 0:42:47| and there's some minor work being done on some of the schools in Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| as it pertains to schools, was being neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| Rural high school was closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| and we found that in Lonsdale, Beaumont, and Mechanicsville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| that students were sent to different middle schools and different high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2591)|
| 0:43:21| and those communities did not have the continuity of other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| in terms of building an allegiance as a community to a series of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2605)|
| 0:43:32| elementary school, middle school, high school, high school reunion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| Lonsdale must get the attention of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, if applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| will raise the economic and social status of Lonsdale, as it will in Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2630)|
| 0:43:59| as it will in all points of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| When I heard Ms. Gill speak about Title VI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| where it was placed in city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| and her emphasis on complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| I knew that she had a superficial knowledge of Title VI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2655)|
| 0:44:23| and the disparity studies and the objective and intention of all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2663)|
| 0:44:32| Complaints is a small part of what this effort is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| That's a passive application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| That's a passive application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| We're waiting for someone to complain, and we will follow the complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| and we will see if someone has openly discriminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| If so, we will try to bring about redress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| That has been dismissed by the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| as a serious attempt at closing the disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2706)|
| 0:45:14| This is why the J.A. Croson decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| out of which came disparity studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| has spoken so openly to ways to close the disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| It moves our effort from being passive to proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| You don't look to see if someone intentionally discriminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| in order to work to bring about equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| You look at the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| If the results and these annual reports show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| that even after 28 years of there being a disparity study for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| that there's been minimal, minimal progress when it comes to Black enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| But if you see that there's a disparity, you are obligated to be proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| You do all things from insisting that there be mentor-protege programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2776)|
| 0:46:26| that there be joint ventures, that there be training programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| that you look at the bonding to see if there's some kind of impediment relative to bonding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| and you arrange bonding in a way that it's accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| You look at your influence on local banks to see if banks can make revenue available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| It's a proactive initiative to bring about equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| It's not looking to see if someone files a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| This is why, one, there needs to be an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| There needs to be education among those at city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| who is responsible for application of Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| And secondly, this further emphasizes the need for a department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| the need for someone running that department who has a full understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| of all components of disparity studies and Title VI applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| and the understanding, and I need for each of you to really listen to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| the understanding if there's going to be an effective Title VI office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| it in and of itself cannot be a part of a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| under which that department is supposed to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| All departments should be under Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| Title VI cannot be part of a department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| because these departments each have to be responsible, I mean responsive to Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| So you made it impotent by closing the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| You made it even more impotent by putting it in a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| and then making it part of, in that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| making it part of three important duties of a department head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| That tells you how inconsequential this effort is being seen by the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| and that's the very thing that we're working to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2917)|
| 0:48:56| I'm talking on mute, my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Council Member Thomas, did that address your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| Yes, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| I appreciate Mr. Matavu going into some detail on that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| You're welcome. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Council, any additional questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| Council Member Rivera-Jones, then Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Mr. Matavu, thank you so much for all the work you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| in sending us the documents that you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| but also for your discussion with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| I wanted to go back to something we talked about just a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| and that was affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| It certainly sounded to me like in the discussion we just had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| that you were thinking about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| maybe more than just affordable rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| It seemed like you were talking about making sure that folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| that are in their homes were able to stay in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Specifically, you were looking at some ideas about property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| I just wanted to ask you about, did I read into that correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| that you were thinking about home ownership as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| What we've done, we've looked at an approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| to in some way put a collar on this gentrification monster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| that's right in our faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| How do we put a collar on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| We know that if a collar is not put on it, if it's not harnessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| that we will be further dispersed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| and any economic and political power will be further diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| I'm going to get to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| but I want to preface it with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| We already see a diminution of the political power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| Urban renewal removed a large number of African-American people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3059)|
| 0:51:09| from around what is now considered downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| Areas in which there were African-American neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| now populated with apartment buildings and condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3080)|
| 0:51:28| If you look east of Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| well, that would be Hill Avenue now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| east of where the old city jail is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| you see the apartment buildings emerging like mushrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3097)|
| 0:51:46| Even as you move further up Jackson Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| you see these old buildings converted to apartment buildings and condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| That's a population change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| With that population change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| it is now about to nullify efforts made during the 60s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| to full-range city council lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| so we could finally get an African-American representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| We must understand, and we forget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| we must understand that from the early 1900s up until 1969, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3142)|
| 0:52:29| we could not elect an African-American representative on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| because of the way the lines were drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| Finally, the lines were drawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| so that we could have a cohesive population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| and we could get a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Well, within those boundaries now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| we are being removed and replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| That's gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Yes, relative to gentrification and property and home ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3176)|
| 0:53:04| we're trying to speak to multiple ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| to further enhance home ownership and rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3189)|
| 0:53:17| and keeping those things within the economic accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| of middle- and lower-income folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| We're trying to find ways that we can make it possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| for people who live in the community now to maintain that residency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| by looking at ways that we can relieve folks of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| looking for ways that we can lower property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| preventing certain kinds of apartments and condominiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3227)|
| 0:53:56| from being built in our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| which are counterproductive to what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| We're just looking at a comprehensive way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| and rental and home ownership is what we're emphasizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| That's what we're emphasizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| Council, were there any additional questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| I just wanted to emphasize a few points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| with a few experiences that I've had over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| One involved a developer in our community, African-American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3277)|
| 0:54:45| who was working on a project in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| but was coming short of the funding needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| to move forward through one of our funding programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| It was a multi-million dollar project that stopped short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3300)|
| 0:55:07| because he was not able to come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| or decided he didn't want to come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| about $10,000 or $20,000 for this maintenance fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| that the city has in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| You have to have money in this maintenance fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| in order for us to give you money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| through the Affordable Rental Housing Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| That's a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| I think that's an absolutely fantastic policy to have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| so that we can ensure that there is continued maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| of these properties throughout the duration of that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| But what bothered me about it was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| when we came up upon this snag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| we weren't solution-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| We weren't looking at the disparities in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| the need for developers of any racial background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| to commit to affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| the commitment to an African-American community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| the commitment to low income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| and then having this Black-owned business grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| and potentially impact and influence other Black-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| That's how we began to build equity in the Black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| We have to think about these solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| not just in one office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| but in every office where decisions are being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| on how public funds are to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| Policies we have in place need to be reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| and we have to have people in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| who have the time and the capacity to review these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| I've created so much work for city staff over the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| that I've definitely gotten emails that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| I would love to look into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| but I don't have time right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| When it comes to issues of race, racial discrimination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| it is too often put it on the back burner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| and not made a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| We've got to make it a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| I heard a speech today that actually inspired me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| It was made during the appointment of our next Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| It was just a discussion of the purpose of our Department of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| and trying to be reminded that our Department of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| was established in 1870 in response to the need nationwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3450)|
| 0:57:38| to ensure that the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| of the U.S. Constitution were enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| I think that this year, as we're seeing so much division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3464)|
| 0:57:52| in our communities, so much vitriol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| what I saw on my television yesterday and a lot of today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| quite frankly, scared me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| I think it's a time for us to be reminded of some commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| that we've made as a country, as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| on how we want to be better, solutions we've put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| that if adopted, if properly implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| would help move us forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| But we've got to make that decision now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| that we're going to make those commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| It's not enough to just put it on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| It's got to be implemented, it's got to be funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| and it's got to have our support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| A lot of the things that Mr. Motavu brought up today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| might sound like things that require only the mayor's action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| and there's not much that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| But there are things that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| We can review our charter and see if there are things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| our civil rights obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| do we want that to be in our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| so that we have a department committed to this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3542)|
| 0:59:09| that can't be easily changed by future administrations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| Is there a way we as a city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| can put certain spending policies in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| so that when we are using money towards affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| we are directing those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| towards those with the most need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| that we are addressing the 42% poverty rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| in the Black community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| I think that we have to challenge ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| to think of what we can do as a city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| as there's discussion of forming a sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| and the community is asking us to review our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| and the community is asking us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| to review our housing authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| Let's take that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Let's make sure that the entity that was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| is what is working for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| When I look at KCDC's website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| and look at the About section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| and go through and think about the need that existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| when the housing authority was established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| and the projects that followed afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| it breaks my heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| because I know we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| Tens of millions, as someone has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| hundreds of millions invested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| but we're not seeing improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| that we want to see in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| I just wanted to lift that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| and challenge this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| to take on this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| to push our city to be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Thank you, Mr. Mutabu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| I think that's all the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| and discussion by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| If that is so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| I want to leave this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| and this presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| by saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| I definitely agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| I think that this is a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| that we need to introspectively look inward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| and challenge ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| We know that there are significant disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| in our African-American communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Deputy Gill and Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| I would like to ask you both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| to maybe do a follow-up with myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| and maybe other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| that may be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| I would like to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| what do Title VI offices look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| in other cities across our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| or other cities that are comparable in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| It does appear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| we do not have a dedicated focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| when we see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| when we go to the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| that there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Ms. Harris is listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| as the Title VI coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| but she also has an additional title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| as grant manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| What that speaks to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| is that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| a dedicated person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| and a dedicated focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| I agree that being proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| in addressing these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| that we know are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| should be a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| I know that there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| disparity studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| I know that there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| a disparity study many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| many years ago with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| I'm not certain with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| because I couldn't find that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| but I did see that Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| did a disparity study in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Metro Nashville in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| and Chattanooga in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| just to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| some of those disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| with the education and knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| that people in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| and communities have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| that it's truly there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| and what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| I would like to have some follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| as it relates to Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Ms. Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| I think that would go under you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| rather than Deputy Chief Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| If you guys could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| I do agree that it is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| I do think that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| as council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| we need to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| those disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| I know that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Albu has sent this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| There's an additional document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| that we've received as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| But I see this as potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| as he mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| an area that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| addressed rather quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| if we feel like that is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| I'm inclined to think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| we do need to challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| ourselves as it relates to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| and addressing disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| There's a lot of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| in every department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| I think Deputy Chief Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| stated that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| There's actually on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| it looks like an online training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| that I have not had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| to delve into that has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| pass-fail information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| we know that the disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| are out there and that they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| I'd just like to see us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| be a little bit more intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| And we'll do a follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| in the next maybe couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| with you and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| We can, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| gather many of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| that you've asked for pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| I know Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Harris and I have talked this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| actually about some of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| that she's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| particularly as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| her involvement in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| and some of the trainings that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| she's been able to offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| not only internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| but externally as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| I want to emphasize again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| that we do this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| as part of our routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| it's not just compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| And I think I do want to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| that sentiment that it can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| just be compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| It also has to be proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| And what I'll make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| that Council receives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| is the annual Title VI report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=3900)|

| 1:34:01| before I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5642)|

| 1:34:07| quickly because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| it was kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| of a follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| Smith was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| I lived a brief time in the Netherlands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| and spent eight months doing nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| but riding a bike everywhere to other countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| But because of that, I know the level of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| that needs to be in place for bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| and people walking and cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| to share spaces easily together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| And I quickly looked up numbers for the Netherlands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| and there's at least 200 bike fatalities per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| in the Netherlands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| even with the infrastructure that they have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| So I don't wanna put you on the spot here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| but I just wanted to kind of put that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| and say I'm really interested in some follow-up information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| about what you've seen in other cities in the US| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| and what kind of infrastructure they have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| because right now I'm struggling to imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| how we could do better than the Netherlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| Thank you for your question, Amelia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| So, you know, again, I wanna direct you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| to there are best practices out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| We don't need to reinvent this stuff on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| There's, again, I mentioned NACDO and AASHTO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| They provide a lot of the best stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| Division Zero Network highlights a lot of communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| on an ongoing basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| So in Knoxville, you know, there are lots of areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| where we could provide, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| I mentioned some of the best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| being separated facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| If we could provide more areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| where we have separated facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| if we could, you know, provide intersection improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| that create safer intersection crossings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| those are oftentimes resulting in huge, huge differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| There are a lot of policy changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| that we could make as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| But without getting into all of that in full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| that's, you know, a lot of that comes down to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| making sure that we have a diverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| and representative steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| and that the action plan is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| drawing on, again, some of those best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| and really, you know, targeting those communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| that need it most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Yeah, so I just wanted to say that I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| I guess a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| or part of BikeWalk Knoxville's advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| which I have had very few meetings with since COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| because I think I had maybe one in-person meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| before COVID hit, or maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| and one was a distance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| And so I just wanted to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| or maybe, and one was a distance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| But I want to say, I think this is incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| And I've been to a lot of different meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| over my lifetime about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| and particularly in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| To frame it for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| this really applies to a lot of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| Everyone who rides the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| no one has a bus that meets them at their door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| They have to walk a distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| And there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| there's a lot about bus stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| being within a quarter mile and a half mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| but we have to make sure that we have safe legways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| you know, to get people to those bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| And I think we're doing a lot of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| that we've made the commitment to complete streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| but this is kind of a public commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| to make sure that we spend our dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| in a way that we address those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| getting people to the bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| or getting people to work or to school in a safe manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| And one of the things is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| we spend money to pave roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| but we don't always spend a little bit more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| to make that protected bike lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| or to put a new sidewalk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| And one of the things from past presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| I think have been sponsored by TPO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| is the concept of eight to 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| There are people who will ride or walk to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| particularly on a bike or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| that maybe are the fit or the able-bodied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| or the more confident on a bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| But the idea is that you design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| your transportation infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| so that eight to 80 feels comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| You want an eight-year-old to be confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| and be protected and feel safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| and you want an 80-year-old, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| a broad range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| And a lot of what we see is only people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| who, you know, feel really confident and able-bodied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| We, you know, some of our streetscapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| that have been redesigned are specifically targeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| to put those islands in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| They're expensive and they've cost a lot of money to put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| but those are to give people a way, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| because again, when we have four and five lane roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| only the most able-bodied can get across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| I've seen improvements in Knoxville where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| we now have audible crosswalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| For a while, we didn't have those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| and we would have people complain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| and we'd have to put them in piecemeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| But now with the complete streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| those are addressed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| So we have improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| We just have a lot of room for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| And so I would support a commitment to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| And I know there's a lot of groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| that are already working on stuff like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| the TPO and the engineering staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| and they do work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| And I think there's been a lot more effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| to pull people to the table and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| that everybody's eyes are on the road projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| that come in and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| that we're spending money on in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| So I think this is really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| for us to be able to meet our climate goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| for us to increase bus ridership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| to make people feel safe to be able to get to those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| And that's a lot of reason that people choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| not to bike ride to work or to school and to leisure things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| So if we're going to improve those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| and get people out of cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| we have to build our infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| so that it's safe for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| Thank you, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| Yes, Ms. Peel, could you just kind of outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| the nuts and bolts of putting this steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| together, who would make the appointees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| How do you see it as a entity, nonprofit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| Any guidance you have from what other cities have done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| Yeah, it's generally structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| as a sort of an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| And, you know, it usually contains people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| from the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| from, you know, some of the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| like engineering and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| It'll usually involve people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| from those most at-risk groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| those that have suffered a lot of traffic fatalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| and injuries or are vulnerable for other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| You know, you want to try to reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| and make sure that you include people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| from, you know, the, you know, retirement community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| or from some of the minority communities in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| So, and make sure that it's geographically representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| as well and work with them together to generate solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| And by having a representative steering committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| that not only ensures that the action plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| is generated to meet the needs of the public at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| but it also provides, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| they're also able to talk to their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| and their constituencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| and it results in a much more responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| and much more welcome environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| for some of the solutions that they come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6114)|
| 1:42:00| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| Somewhat, as would it be composed of appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| from the mayor or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| Yeah, the mayor would probably be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| You know, like I said, this is a grassroots campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| so there really is no directive for how this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| But oftentimes, yes, it is, would be the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| and the administration that would select individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| I'm sure the council's advice would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| welcomed and would weigh into that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| Yeah, I just wanted to get a general idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| of how you would set it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| and kind of what kind of structure it would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| And you gave that to me, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| If you'll indulge my jumping in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| I think Brian really articulated it very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| but I did want to reiterate that this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| that Mayor Kincaiden is very supportive of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| And to the extent that council is also kind of supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| of this concept, we would very much welcome a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| to bring you that resolution that would outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| the way that we would propose going about setting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| that round table, that advisory group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| to help us think through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| and bring that kind of umbrella vision of Vision Zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| to weave together much of what we're already doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| and where we know we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Yeah, one of the things that Mr. Hill said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| that I particularly liked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| and it was just kind of the overall approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| is that you're cognizant of efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| that have already happened in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| efforts that are ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| and you're not trying to come in and reinvent the wheel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| because we're doing a lot of good stuff now and have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| So that gave me confidence in your approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| and that you were looking at it as just trying to augment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| and possibly just try to coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| and make things more harmonious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| And so I appreciate your kind of approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| Let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6258)|
| 1:44:26| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| Mr. Johnson, is there anything that you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| to assist Council Member Fugate with her volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| or to just her connection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| I think it's on her end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| And in the past, her volume tends to kick in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| a few moments after she begins to speak sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| Warm up, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| We can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| See, apparently, I need a new computer, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| That's apparently it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| This one is on its last leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| Okay, all kidding aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| who can be against reducing traffic deaths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| So of course, I think everybody's gonna be for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| As with everything, the devil is always in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| So of course, I would support a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| that's put together to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| A question which no one can answer for me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| but I think this will be the devil in the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| is a strategy for what areas need to happen first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6329)|
| 1:45:35| What's the cost to do some of these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| And to Ms. Ryder's point, way back in the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| and I'm aging myself back in nine counties in vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| we talked a lot about this for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| we've been talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| You know, if you design it with this in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| it is far cheaper than retrofitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| So, you know, the bike lane kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| So I guess what I would hope is if this group comes together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| that it's not just about do we want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| but it's beginning to be a prioritization of where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| Where do we have the most deaths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| Where do we tackle first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| Because just a feel-good resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| that says we want to reduce traffic deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| yeah, I can't imagine any of us voting against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| So I think that's not a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| to get the resolution passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| The question is, what is the group actually going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| and produce that then provides actionable things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| for us to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| I rest my case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6406)|
| 1:46:52| Mr. Hill, do you or Ms. Cooley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| want to address that question, Ms. Cooley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| You're on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| Yes, I just wanted to point out more specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| a couple of different things I wanted to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| But the first is that Ellen Zavisko at the TPO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| as Brian's already mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| has done an extraordinary job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| of looking at all the high crash areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| I have attended many Vision Zero seminars and webinars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| and Ellen's job is way above most communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| So we know where the high crash areas are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| They're Broadway, Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| it's where people are walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| because they have no cars to drive to places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| They go walk to the bus stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| they walk to the Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| So those are the high crash areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| where pedestrians and bicyclists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| particularly pedestrians are getting injured and killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| The second point I want to make addressing to Charlie Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| about what are any of U.S. is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| what are some low cost options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| What are the policies and particularly policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| that can really have an impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| The first is possibly what Richmond, Virginia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| is lowering their city within their city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| that no arterials will have a speed limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| over 35 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| Now people do speed and they don't look at the speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| but it does have some impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| The other is making a decision on arterials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| that the travel lanes don't need to be 12, 13 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| and on neighborhood roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| The narrow lanes, slow traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| and it leaves room for wider sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| or sidewalks or the bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| And so those types of policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| can make a difference right off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6529)|
