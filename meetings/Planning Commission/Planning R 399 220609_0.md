| 0:20:12| We supported that before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| As a matter of fact, it's now under construction and it will go online in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| That's a big plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| More needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| We commend the staff for their creative use on review procedures to be able to insert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| residential land use into those Knox County districts that didn't allow residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1236)|
| 0:20:44| But by inserting them into the existing zoning classifications, it eliminated a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| delays, as you can imagine, for rezonings that might have otherwise been necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| Excuse me, Mr. Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| I hate to interrupt you, but your time is running out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| Could you wrap up your comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| I guess my first question is, do you approve of the plan or are you objecting to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| We think the staff has done an incredible job of incorporating the information from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| the Charette, from the public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| We have one exception to that, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| I handed out a plan that shows a parcel that has been under contention for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1283)|
| 0:21:31| It's called Zero Mount Vernon Road, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| It's a little triangle, 1.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| In the expansion, in the expansion of the sector classification, we do not think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1301)|
| 0:21:51| that should go to commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| In fact, the staff even included in the report an item where they were discouraging use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| the shopping center zone because it didn't provide the opportunities that the other classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| So, our neighborhood association that covers both sides of the highway strongly opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| the expansion of the shopping center zone onto that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| There, you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| It is the entrance to Martha Washington Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Another point that's made in the small area plan that's still in effect is to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| existing residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| Martha Washington Heights has over 150 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| It's a stable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| They've been an active part of this planning process, and we think that we ought to collectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1359)|
| 0:22:47| as a community, respect the protection of the entrance to their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1374)|

| 0:23:00| Commission, do you have any comments on the Alcoa Corridor, Alcoa Highway Corridor study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| The Chair will entertain a motion to approve the Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| We do have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Commissioner Graf, I recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| I'm not surprised you didn't recognize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| It's been that way for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| How can that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| I've only been on the Commission for six, and the Chair is two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| My comments on this have to do with the emphasis that the design threat, or when they did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1410)|
| 0:23:47| it's made up of the public, of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| There were staff people involved, but mostly it was people in the community and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| that worked for the design center and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| They divided into four groups and came up with different proposals, and not one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1446)|
| 0:24:16| included this triangular piece of property in their proposal that it needed to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1456)|
| 0:24:26| Just leave it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| The other thing on the, in your own report here, the Alcoa Highway Small Area Plan Objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1470)|
| 0:24:41| It's on page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| Number four is protect the character of neighborhoods adjacent to Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1484)|
| 0:24:53| Martha Washington is as adjacent as you could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| The highway took their existing entrance now and moved it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1498)|
| 0:25:08| Now, if you put this in as a commercial use, you're putting a commercial use at the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1508)|
| 0:25:17| to your subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| There are acres and acres and acres of property that this covers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1520)|
| 0:25:32| This is one acre, or one plus something acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| It's not in the middle of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| It's on the edge of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| It's not like, if we don't do this, the whole 30 acres is down the tubes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1544)|
| 0:25:52| This is, should be, it's requested by the neighborhood, by the design people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1552)|
| 0:26:01| that it stay the same as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| I would make a motion that we approve item number 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1567)|
| 0:26:15| with the exception of this piece, I don't know how to identify it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1575)|
| 0:26:24| but the piece of property right at the entrance to Martha Washington Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| It's low density residential now, and that it remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf, seconded by Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| to approve the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1604)|

| 0:26:55| with the stipulation that the 1.5 acre triangle piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| at the intersection of Martha Washington Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| is removed from the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| You heard the motion in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1631)|

| 0:27:31| This is a rezoning, file 6B22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1651)|

| 0:27:44| Size of track, 8,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Presently zoned office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Zoning requested, CN Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| Staff recommendation, approve CN Neighborhood Commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| because it is consistent with the sector plan and one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| Applicant Michael Crager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Are you representing Mr. Craig?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| I'm going to be here for, Mr. Craig is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| but I'm going to also speak on behalf of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Is there opposition for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| Mr. Mullins, you're free to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| 550 West Main Street, Suite 500, here for the Applicant Hand Partnership, LP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| Like I said, Mr. Craig, who filed the application, is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| as well as Jennifer Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| She is the proprietor of the business that's going to be utilizing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| once it's rezoned to Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| There was some concern, some neighborhood opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| and I would call it soft opposition because I believe there was also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| some statements in the comments that were also in support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| just with some concern that potential issues like lighting and noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Staff has recommended approval for this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| It meets the criteria for Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| This is in a mixed use special district in the West City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| It's a very, very small lot, 8,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| The intent is, and I think pretty much the only practical way to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| this property for commercial property is to repurpose and reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| the building that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| And what they're intending to do is they're intending to bake cookies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| And they're not intending to have any retail sale there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| They're going to deliver the cookies from that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| or occasionally there might be someone who come and would pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| an order of cookies from that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| It started out in Miss Bruce's kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| It's outgrown her kitchen, and she was looking for space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| that would be appropriate for this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| And in consulting with staff, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| Neighborhood Commercial would fit at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1789)|

| 0:30:01| and this being on the corner, Neighborhood Commercial would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| make perfect sense for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I think if Mr. Craig or Miss Bruce would like to maybe talk more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| about their concept, they would love to answer questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| But otherwise, I would ask that you follow staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| recommendation and approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1815)|

| 0:31:01| Commissioner Smith or Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| I'm just going to make a motion if you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| unless you want to ask a question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| No, well, I was just going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| did you all read about their concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Any comments to share for the neighborhood association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| I'll be happy to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| I think most of them were, a lot of the concerns were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| relation to the businesses actually behind us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| the restaurant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| We're not related to that and won't, I mean, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| we can't do anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| The only thing Jennifer's going to be doing there is cooking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| cookies, baking cookies, decorating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| She has a company called Grizzly Bear Baking Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| If you've never seen her, never used her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| wonderful, does a great job with cookies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| It'll be primarily her and maybe an assistant that work there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| They'll deliver cookies occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| There'll be a person that comes by and picks up an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| So really, all those concerns, I know you guys have a job to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| and protect the neighborhood maybe after Jennifer's gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| but that's the initial intent of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1919)|

| 0:32:11| with the sector plan and one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1931)|

| 0:32:20| Neighborhood Commercial Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=1940)|

| 0:34:01| We asked for 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2041)|

| 0:34:40| I did earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| My name is Christy Gaddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| My address is 2927 Bernard Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| I've lived on that road for almost 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| I've raised my kids on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| All of our neighbors have raised our kids on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| My house is about a half a mile in the middle of that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| My address is 2927.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| In front of my house, it is only 14 feet 7 inches wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2102)|

| 0:35:10| it is only 13 feet 6 inches wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| You can go down farther down Bernard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| and at the very beginning of the West End,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| it's only 12 foot 10 inches wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| I actually brought pictures and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| but I didn't know I was supposed to submit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| But we took pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| We went out there and measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| That road is nowhere close to 16 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| as they stated in the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| It is in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| and that's where all these apartments are being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| We haven't even got the impact of the traffic that they've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| approved for all these new apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| When you go into Bernard Road right at the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| the road is 13 feet 9 inches wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| There was a comment that one of my neighbors submitted with a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| The car is 6 feet 9 inches wide if you look in the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| There's no room for another car to come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| Not only is the road that narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| a lot of it is like foot-off embankments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Personally, I've pulled my kids out of those ditches several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| They're friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| We've had numerous wrecks on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| I have a police report from just a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| from a neighbor that was in a wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| And every time the police come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| it's a no-fault accident because they say the road is too narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| There's no dividing line in it, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| And so it's just you're playing chicken as you go down this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| So if you all even add to the four units like you're talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| another 300 cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| that's like a chance of 300 more times that we're going to get hit on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| So we as a neighborhood, and I actually have a petition from our road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| that like most of our road sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| we do not want this property rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| We have so much cross-through traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| as it is from all those apartments being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| There used to be an old country road when I moved there 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| Only people that traveled it was the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Then they built Amherst on the other side of ball camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| All those neighborhoods on the other side of Burton Howard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| are zoned for Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| All those people use our road every day as a cut-through road to get to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2249)|
| 0:37:37| There was no actual traffic study done on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| We're asking that this at least be postponed for a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| if it's just not denied altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| because the road does not have room for an extra 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| We don't even have room for an extra 100 cars as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| And I would encourage all of you all to drive down this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| because it's a very scary situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| I thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you, Ms. Caddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Yeah, I'd like to hear from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| It looks to me like this piece is contiguous to the 12th breaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| and I'm not suggesting that this is not a good place to stop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| but I'm just curious about all the contiguous higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| and whether or not that's just really, really old stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| that we just place the density on it based on map updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| or just give a little bit of history of how this other stuff got sunk next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| Ms. Hillman, do you want to respond to Commissioner Eaton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| Sure, so the higher density to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| Could you speak a little closer to your mic? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| The higher density to the east was assigned a while back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| and it is not in alignment with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| at least the property north of Barnard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| And really, as you enter this neighborhood through the tree buffer west of Soothe Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| it is a very well-established low-density rural feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| And there is a property, RA zone property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| in between the proposed property and the higher density property to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| So that was part of the consideration for a lower density down to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| which is in alignment with the sector plan and with the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| because a third of this property is in the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| as well as the adjacent RA zoning would allow an equivalent density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2390)|
| 0:39:58| to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| So that was another part of the reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| Thank you, Ms. Hillman. Commissioner Raul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| I've got a question. I probably should know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Would a traffic study be required at 12 dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| I can't remember the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| No, it would have to generate 750 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| It would need to generate 750 trips a day to require a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| And I just wanted to clarify, in the report it does say 304 average daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| That's at the proposed density of 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| With the recommended density of four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| it would be around 100, 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| So either way it would not require a traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Any other comments from commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| I was going to ask Knox County Roads, on the substandard road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| or the narrower road that the resident was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| would the developer be required to improve the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| And to what width and what distance if that was required, even without a traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| Yeah, this road, the lady that lives there knows it better than I, but it is very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| It probably doesn't allow for two cars to pass without one of them getting off into the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| We did have a project that was from there that we realigned the intersection of Woodsmith and Bernard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| and made some improvements geometrically with that developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| So at a minimum, we would want the frontage of this property improved to match that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2504)|
| 0:41:51| I think we went to 20 feet, two 10-foot lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| but I don't think we could require them to widen anything further back towards Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| And there is a significant distance of the road that does go back to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2519)|
| 0:42:07| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| I'd like to make a motion to deny the plan amendment to MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| because it does not meet the location criteria or the requirements for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| We have a motion by Commissioner Schelso, seconded by Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| to deny the sector plan amendment to MDR density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Motion carries with one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| Two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| We have two noes, Commissioner Roth and Commissioner Hooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Chair will entertain a motion to approve PR plan residential zoning up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| We have a motion by Commissioner Adams, seconded by Commissioner Schelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| to approve PR plan residential zoning up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| Under plan residential, what's the maximum density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2584)|
| 0:43:16| You know, we go back to this density all the time, and we talk about how we need density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| We voted to deny MDR, but I would suggest that we at least go with five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| If whoever made the motion might consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| If not, that's fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| I just want to throw that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| We do have a motion on the floor to approve PR plan residential zoning up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| Next is agenda item number 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| This is a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| File 6J22RZ and 6B22SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| Applicant is Wayne Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| Location north of Oak Ridge Highway, west side of Pennell Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| Tract is 1.15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| Present plan designation is low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Zoning is RA low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Proposed plan designation is general commercial, and the requested zoning is general business CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| Staff recommendation, deny the sector plan amendment to GC general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| zoning because it is not consistent with the adjacent residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| Staff is also recommending denial of CA general business zoning because it is not compatible with the adjacent residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2687)|
| 0:44:57| Is there opposition to this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| Mr. Klein, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Please state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| I'm Wayne Klein, 617 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| I'm here on behalf of Mr. Ingram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| He is here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| He's not a public speaker, but I'm going to speak on his behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| He's the owner of this lot at 6909 Pennell Lane requesting a sector plan change and a change in zoning in an area that is in transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2715)|
| 0:45:24| It used to be residential, and if you look at the maps on KGIS, kind of looks like it remains residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| but kind of the boots on the ground view of this, if you're there, you have three lots on Pennell Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| Are you at the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Yes, you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| You have three lots on Pennell Lane that are accessible only from Pennell Lane, and they're commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2742)|
| 0:45:50| One of them is not this one, but you can see the two across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| You just changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Yes, the two across the Pennell Lane, those two lots are zone commercial, CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| There's another lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| If you go down Pennell Lane beyond this lot, two houses, you see the road that takes a left-hand turn off of Pennell Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2766)|
| 0:46:15| and the arrow is pointing to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| That road takes you to another landscape business behind this area, and it is being accessed through Pennell Lane only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2777)|
| 0:46:28| I think your report says that when that was zone commercial, there was a condition that they access only through the commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2788)|
| 0:46:36| but that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| That's not correct, and the access is through Pennell Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| What's happening is you have three lots that are zone commercial, and these have only internal access from Pennell Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2803)|
| 0:46:52| There's also a landscape business that we talked about two houses further down than Mr. Ingram's lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| He seeks only to move his office to his property when the time is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| He'll be virtually a corner lot on Oak Ridge Highway when it's widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| not like this landscape business that already runs like 20 trucks through there a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| He'll be the corner lot, so he's not going to, and we did try to talk to all the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| We didn't get to these two people that put comments in because we don't know who they are and where they live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| but we have basic agreement from all of the surrounding property owners from Mr. Ingram's lot that they don't mind him putting his office there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2847)|
| 0:47:37| and they don't mind the application that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| For now, Mr. Ingram is content to continue renting his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| but it's getting harder to find renters because of the transition, because of the commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| and he wants to place his business office at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| He has a landscaping business and he has a trailer with a bobcat on it, and that's why he needs this GCGB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2878)|
| 0:48:07| From the intention of Mr. Ingram, he does not want to ruin anybody's residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2887)|
| 0:48:17| and there are a couple of folks that still live down this lane that are long-term residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| but primarily the residential character of this neighborhood is from the 1950s, and it really doesn't exist anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2904)|
| 0:48:34| Since he's the sole proprietor, his own driving skills will be at play when he enters and exits Pennell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| but he's not going to go down Pennell Lane because he'll be at the corner of Oak Ridge Highway, especially when it's widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2922)|
| 0:48:51| The recent rezoning of the other properties, such as the Graham property in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| further lends to the changes in condition warranting amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| We have to meet certain criteria, and we believe we have met them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| The proposed amendment we have follows these changing conditions, supports and meets Article 6.30.01, required condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2943)|
| 0:49:12| It must be consistent with the intent and purpose, and his intended use is commensurate with the other uses in the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2952)|
| 0:49:22| In fact, there is a BP gas station that is 87 feet from his property line, which is fronting on Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2962)|
| 0:49:33| That's another component of the changing landscape of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2973)|
| 0:49:43| It will not adversely affect any other part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| and the widening of Oak Ridge Highway will make Mr. Ingram's lot a corner lot to Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| and meets the intent and placement of commercial activity adjacent to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| These changes, as well as the addition of a waste collection facility just behind his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=2997)|
| 0:50:08| not only makes it harder for him to rent, but also has changed the character and the transition to commercial in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3008)|
| 0:50:16| These proposed amendments-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Mr. Klein, can you wrap it up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Am I done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| You're done, yeah, but I'll give you a few more-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Well, I'm talking, I'm not looking at the clock, so thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| Those are our fundamental comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| If you have any questions about meeting the requirements, we'll be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Thank you, Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Question for Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Mr. Klein referenced the widening of Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| Where is that in relation to schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| Yes, sir, and my apologies for not paying attention there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| You were busy with county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| TDOT has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| That's actually in the Improve Act, so it is one of the projects that they prioritized as part of the gas tax initiative a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| It is in design right now and should be going into right-of-way acquisitions later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| So probably construction, I would imagine, sometime in calendar year 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| So it's actively in development at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| And how much of this property do you believe will be taken, on the frontage there, will be taken for right-of-way purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| All of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| It is being designed as a five-lane, much like to the east of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| So it will be a very wide, typical section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| It will have a five-lane with full-width shoulders, curb and gutter, and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| So the alignment, I haven't seen it specifically, but you could say pretty much from the centerline of the existing road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3105)|
| 0:51:54| probably 55 to 60 feet would be where the state would acquire to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| So, yes, there would definitely be a sizable acquisition from that parcel there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Chair recognizes Commissioner Luton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| Yeah, this one's a little tough for me, but I'm remembering a few months ago where we had a piece of property that was a mini-warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3131)|
| 0:52:22| It was in the county, and we left part of the property, zoned ag, and didn't rezone it so we could create some sort of buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| And if you pan back out here a little bit, I noticed earlier on Wright Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| Just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| It's like the next piece over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| This thing, like, was zoned, split some piece of property right here or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| Did I see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| Yeah, it goes back to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| Yeah, back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Is that a property line, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| I guess it's a property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Anyway, I was curious as to who would be considering leaving a big footstrip or a 35 footstrip or something along the north side of the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3182)|
| 0:53:12| just to create some sort of buffer in the rest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Is that even something we would contemplate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| Potentially, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Actually, in a closer look at that property that you just pointed out, Commissioner, it does look like it is split zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| Are you saying that you would suggest the northern part of that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3214)|
| 0:53:44| And then give them a commercial zoning for the front part of it that's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| I think it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3229)|
| 0:53:59| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| Question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Did staff consider the road widening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| And if you would refer to page 20-20 in your packet, you can see that we did some research and found that on TDOT's sort of list of improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3254)|
| 0:54:32| they have this slated that right of way acquisition is not anticipated to begin until mid-2026,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| with actual construction not occurring for probably five to seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| So that was the research that we did at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| Is that in alignment with what you would project, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| I'm sorry, Liz. I didn't catch all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| Sorry. So we had on some documentation from TDOT that right of way acquisition was not expected to begin until mid-2026| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3296)|
| 0:55:07| and that the actual construction project probably wouldn't happen for about five to seven years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3307)|
| 0:55:16| I would think that they would move a little quicker than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| I know that the administration at TDOT is trying to get those improved back projects out because those were committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3320)|
| 0:55:27| things that they told the community as part of the gas tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| So I don't want to disagree with Liz, but I would think that they would move that along a little quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3330)|
| 0:55:37| I think I could support something along the lines of what Commissioner Hooten proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Yeah. You know, I don't want to prevent somebody from having a home office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| I just, the concern I have is you have a neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| It's my understanding that some of those properties that may be zoned CA are still used as residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| And I guess RA allows home offices. That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| Is there something in particular about what the applicant wants to do that doesn't fit into the RA home office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| Kind of sounds like storage of equipment, Commissioner, is what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| That is correct. You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Just a Bobcat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| It's a Bobcat on a trailer with a truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| That would not be allowed in RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| I wouldn't think that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| When I met with Ms. Albertson, we decided, and I deferred to her, that this would be the appropriate zoning, and that's why we went this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3391)|
| 0:56:41| Code's response on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| They could have one truck under one and a half ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| They could have one trailer under 40 feet, but they could not have the Bobcat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| Does the applicant want to respond to our question about the split zoning or the possibility thereof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| Mr. Kline, do you want to respond to Commissioner Uten's suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| I haven't spoken to my client about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| All right, why don't you speak with your client, and I'll allow other commissioners to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3428)|

| 0:57:15| Nick, can you draw 50 feet again from the centerline of Oak Ridge Highway towards the property that's applying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| If they were to acquire any part of that property, it doesn't appear like it's going to make this property the new frontage property, as the applicant has discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3442)|
| 0:57:36| I think that I'm inclined to vote against this commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3456)|
| 0:57:45| We wait to see what the acquisition of the right-of-way does to it, and he's not looking to move his office there immediately, he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| So, you know, I'm inclined to vote against and revisit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| That was actually one of the things I was going to ask for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| You said that we're looking at probably a 100-foot right-of-way right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| So there probably wouldn't be any acquisitions in this section, because it's already 100 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| And then my other question was with the Bobcat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Is that something that could be stored in a shed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| Or a garage or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Yes, if they kept it inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| And if I might respond to Commissioner Uden's suggestion, the problem is, is the access is on the side that you would maintain low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3512)|
| 0:58:41| That would be the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| Commissioner Smith, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3528)|

| 1:02:48| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Catherine Anglin, 900 South Gay Street, Suite 2200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| On behalf of two property owners adjacent to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| and if you zoom in, it's properties along East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| If you move it up, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| So you kind of see an L shape, one longer property and the one next to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| those two properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| Thank you for your attention and the opportunity to speak in objection to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| First, some history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| The original, an original concept plan was proposed in November 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| and was approved thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| The original plan had a detention basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| Where you currently see the detention lot, after approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| it was moved to the location of the common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| which is currently marked as the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| During the development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| sinkholes developed in the bottom of that detention basin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| which gathered all the water from the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| took it into the bottom of the detention basin and underneath our client's properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| and caused additional sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| So there were sinkholes in the bottom of the detention basin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| and then, as you can see on that map that you were just showing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| there's multiple sinkholes on our client's properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| And while there's been changes in property ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| and the problem detention basin has been filled in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| the overall drainage of the site has not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| And because this concept plan does not address drainage issues on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3869)|
| 1:04:37| there is increased drainage from the prior drainage that go onto our client's properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| developing even additional problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| And this is going to continue to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| So unless a concept plan is provided that addresses drainage issues from the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3891)|
| 1:05:00| so that they remain consistent with what it was before any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| there will be continuing issues raising continuing concerns for liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| for any current or future owners of this subdivision or homes in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| Also, there's concerns because there's known sinkholes, as you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| and we appreciate that there's a buffer zone as one of the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3920)|
| 1:05:31| We're concerned that the property is conducive to sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| and that may not be fully addressed or investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| And so future property owners should be aware that the area is conducive to sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3943)|
| 1:05:50| And because the existing plans don't address the additional drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| and causing additional sinkholes, even though there's a buffer zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| that's not going to address the fact that there's going to be areas even closer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| for example, I think 34 or 36 that are likely to have additional sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3964)|
| 1:06:13| And then also, there's line of sight issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3973)|
| 1:06:28| The entrance to the subdivision is near curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| and I see the recommendation was to approve regardless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=3994)|
| 1:06:41| but we have concerns that the entrance to the subdivision does not have good line of sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4001)|
| 1:06:49| such that it's a safety concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Thank you very much for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| Address the sinkhole issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| The pond has been moved previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| I tell you, could you raise up the podium there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| The detention pond is in the current location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| and that was approved previously by Knox County, and it's in that location today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| The subdivision started previously in 17, was approved by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| and then was further permitted through Knox County and began construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| so the entire site is rough graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| The stormwater infrastructure is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| The utilities are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| This is a reduction of four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| The road layout is exactly the same as previous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| so it's basically trying to get this completed, get the roads paved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| and the houses built to stabilize and finish the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| This concept plan had expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| It's why we're back now to get it reapproved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| Any other comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| So am I understanding correctly that the opposition is saying that the detention area is in one place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| and that the applicant is saying that it is in another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| May I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| It was originally built in the common area space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| but because it caused problems and it had sinkholes in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| it couldn't function as a detention basin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| so they had to move it over to what's currently identified as the detention lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| So we're in agreement as to the current location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| The prior location caused problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| but also the general way that the subdivision is graded causes runoff issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| in addition to those sinkhole-drainage detention basin issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| I had questions, and this may be for staff just to draw on the map that we can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| or the concept plan that we can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| but where exactly are the sidewalks that are planned for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4160)|
| 1:09:31| If you can move the cursor where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| It's actually proposed to have sidewalks through the entire subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| Can you say it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| Sidewalks are actually proposed through the entire subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| There's just certain sidewalk segments that are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| as part of the Knox County sidewalk ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| but the proposal is to actually have sidewalks through the whole subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| My question is for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| Are you opposed to approving this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| or are you just wanting to bring to our attention problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| and want some assurances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| or would you rather this concept plan not be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4214)|
| 1:10:22| We're rejecting the concept plan as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| so that it can be redone to address the drainage for the whole site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| And the concern is just you want to make sure that drainage stays off your client's property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| And it does not do that, you don't think, now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| No, it does not do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Just for clarification purposes, the concept plan is not a total engineering plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| It doesn't show all the pertinences for drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| It's just a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| It's just a general layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| And the actual hydraulic calculations and design of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| will come in the preliminary drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| Which, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| Commissioner Midas, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| Did you say that there was going to be a stormwater study, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| on the water coming off this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| Did I hear that? No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| Will engineering do, like, a stormwater study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| The drainage study for the site has been submitted to Knox County and approved previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| There was a drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| The pond is in place, and the drainage is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| So there was a study for any of the stormwater to see if it drained off of the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| Yes, Robert Campbell and associates did the design to move the detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| from the original location of a common lot to the detention lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| as shown on the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| And he didn't show any stormwater drainage coming off onto the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| that Ms. Englund is representing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| The water is all routed to the pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| and then it is discharged down the main entrance and tied into Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| Thank you, Chairman Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Engineering, we're talking about, in my mind, we're talking about this runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| It's an engineering question, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| I mean, during the development, and I guess it's graded already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| so if there's already grading done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| there has been obviously some type of engineering runoff formed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| As Mr. Anderson noted, Robert Campbell and associates did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| we worked in conjunction with them to relocate the pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| due to the concerns of the downstream neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| So all the offsite water, the site pretty much drains from top all the way down to Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| so there's a swale that runs along that separates their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| the lady's property, the client's property, from this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| and conveys that water into the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| So we tried to mitigate all that water that comes from the upper side into the pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| and avoid it getting on to this lady's client's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| So in my mind, that's a function thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| so not necessarily something that we, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| we require there's something to be engineered and done the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| If there's water getting off that property that's not supposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| that's a function problem, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| So you can hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| In my mind, what we're talking about, water runoff with a grading and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| there is a design that's designed to prevent that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| and if it's not working right now that's a function issue of whoever's working on the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| that they need to remediate in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| But as a body here, in my mind, what we're deciding is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| we don't control that, engineering controls that during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4456)|
| 1:14:25| Chair recognizes Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| Mike, the Hoff Road that is next to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| how come the road's not connecting to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| It's just a pedestrian way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| So as was mentioned previously, this was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| and the original concept plan was approved in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| and at the time we did explore the connection of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| a vehicle connection to Upland, and we decided that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| one thing the neighborhood over there was not excited about the connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| and we decided that a pedestrian connection at the very least was what we anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| so at this point I wouldn't expect a new request for them to make a connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| a vehicle connection to Huff Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| But that was the reason why we decided the pedestrian connection was the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4517)|
| 1:15:27| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| I remember this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| It has been kind of a problematic thing over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| and I think one of the things along, you know, Knox County, as their eye on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| I believe your clients did legitimately have problems put on them that weren't from their own property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4540)|
| 1:15:49| but I do also believe that the way to resolve all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| along with the county's careful oversight, is completion of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| When the roads are paved and everything's put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| that's when the drainage system functions its best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| because right now more than likely that water on that site is just running everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| So I'm going to make a motion that we move forward on approving the requested variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| and alternate design standards based on justifications provided by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| and the recommendations of Knox County Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| and the proposal will not create a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| We have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| We approve the requested variances and alternative design standards for staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| All in favor of the motion say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Opposed? Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| Chair will entertain a motion to approve the concept plan subject to 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| We have a motion by Commissioner Newton, second by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| to approve the concept plan subject to 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| All in favor of the motion say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| Opposed? Motion carries unanimously. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| Next is agenda item number 27, subdivision concept use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4626)|

| 1:17:18| The subdivision is Everett Woods, applicant developer is Justin Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4638)|

| 1:17:34| Acreage is 24.77 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Zoning is PR plan residential and F floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| Proposed use attached to residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| Number of lots are 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| We do have one variance and two alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| requiring planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| Staff recommends approving the requested variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| and alternative design standards based on the justifications provided by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| the recommendations of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| and the proposal will not create a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| Staff also recommends approving the concept plan subject to eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| Staff also recommends approving the development plan for up to 59 attached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| on individual lots subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| The applicant's present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| Yes, Justin Morgan, 134 Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| Would you like to go first or would you like to offer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| Thank you. Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| I find myself in an unusual position for me in representing opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| I was asked by the Everett Woods Homeowner Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| to speak on this about their concerns and their opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| I know there were several comments that were posted online as well as a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| The existing neighborhood is Everett Woods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| and there is an existing HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| This proposed development, even though Mr. Morgan is calling it Everett Woods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| is not part of the Everett Woods subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| It will be separate and not part of the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| And that's part of the problem is this property was part of an overall approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4763)|
| 1:19:31| that was approved in 2016 for this master concept plan, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| that included a diversity of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| There was some multifamily that was approved as a concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| and then there was a use-on-review that went forward pretty recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| across Everett Road for that multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| There was a proposed assisted living facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| that was on another piece of the property separated by Yarnell, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| And then this part of the property, which you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| is the part that's graded in the aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| That's all been built out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| And then the yellow hatched area, which is the remaining approximately 25 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| that was all approved for single-family detached dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| approximately 163 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| The Everett Woods that's existing, that's Phase 2A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| of the previously approved single-family residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| It was ultimately bought and then developed by Turner Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| who did single-family residences, approximately 125 there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| What this application is doing now is moving away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| from the previously approved single-family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| and taking a small part of the remaining 25 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| about 5 acres of it, I believe, 4.94, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| something close to that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| and developing attached townhome residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| Now, I've been here representing Turner Homes before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| Turner Homes is actually the development of the single-family residences there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| Turner Homes develops townhomes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| There's not necessarily an issue with townhome developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| when it's done right and it's properly planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| Here we think they've got the cart before the horse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| in that they are now trying to put a square peg in a round hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| and squeeze a group of attached single-family residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| in an area that was never intended to be designed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| Typically, if you do a proper townhome concept plan design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| you would want the attached units, the more dense development part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| to be at the beginning of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| feather out the density as you go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| and this is the exact opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| And that's the nature of a lot of the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| that you've heard from the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| They bought into the single-family residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| expecting it to be developed as a single-family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| Now, I understand things change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| but it does create some planning issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| especially with regard to pulling additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| through an existing residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| And I think if you look at the provisions for use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| and the criteria that needs to be met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| that is the one that you can look at a little more closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| and see they are increasing the total density by about 21 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| instead of doing another 38 single-family residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| instead of doing 59 attached townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| And that's going to have to come through an existing residential street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| that was designed for single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| not for these types of townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| It wasn't intended to be that way, and yet that's what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| And if you develop it with the townhomes in the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| and the residential in the back, it was intended that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| you avoid this patchwork development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| that's just out of character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| It also creates an interesting issue that they are condensing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| This was approved for five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| and as proposed right now, I believe Mr. Reynolds said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| it's 4.94 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| and they're squeezing that on five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| and leaving the other 20 acres just basically undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| when those residences could have been spread out more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| and taken advantage of that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| Now, I was talking to Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| He does think there's some room to increase that allowable density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| based on the way it was calculated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| but the overall point is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| is instead of spreading it out and developing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| the way it was initially intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| you're putting all of that in one area so it can be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| because that's the part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| that's currently under control from the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| On behalf of the Everett Woods Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| we would ask that you look at this and either deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| or you ask them to come back and come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| with an alternate design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| that takes advantage of more of the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| and keeps it in character with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| that's already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| and what the people that were there bought into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| I don't know if anybody from the neighborhood is here to speak also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| but I would ask that you respect what they intended to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| when they purchased their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| I would like to address most of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| He was correct on the process and the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| We were at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| This increase is actually only 15 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| over what we originally planned for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| which is between 163 and 165,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| so a total of just under 180 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| We are not developing roughly 20 acres of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| because it is a protected stream area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| We can't use it where we would have used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| I would agree that if we could have put density in other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| we would have, but it's not possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| because of the creek that runs the backside of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| towards Yarnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| So all of that cannot be disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| because of the stream and the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| We have done a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| The additional 15 units over what was proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| will only add eight vehicles within the peak drive time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| and only 133 in the entire day, which is almost negligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| I think that's been the biggest complaint from the homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| is traffic, and if you'll look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| we still control what this is is going to be Phase 2C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| the third section of the second phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| 2A is just now under construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| which if you zoom out a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| is right around the primary detention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| and 2B has not even been sold to homeowners yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| So no homeowners currently live in 2A or 2B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| which are the two sections that butt up to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| Those have not been transferred to any homeowner at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| They're all in Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| Phase 1 enters from the opposite direction of the main entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| If you can go to the overall project, I could show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5160)|
| 1:26:09| So we're in the upper northern section of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| You can't really see the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| All you're seeing is basically Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Phase 1 is on the opposite side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| Everyone who has complained can almost not even see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| this section of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| It is also 6 to 10 feet below the existing grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| It is lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| The northern section drops lower towards the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| So we thought this would be a good transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| We lost several lots during the development of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| due to dirt issues and a streamhead that we found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| that we had to then put a retaining wall around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| which is why several of the single-family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| were not able to be built, and we're using that density in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| So we're trying to maximize the use of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| but also leave as much green space as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| The transitions between 2A and 2B into this new section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| has slope issues, so we have to be further away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| And in that section where our townhomes will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| surrounding areas of the entrances from 2A and 2B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| we have submitted a plan for extensive landscape trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| and buffers that I think would help the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| It is probably not the perfect location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| if I had done this from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| but I think from what we have and what we're trying to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| will be a great addition to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| The other thing, if I was living there, that I would wonder is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| what quality is this product going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| We are going to maintain the exact same exterior feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| and quality of the product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| The minimum square footage that the current builder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| is building in there is 1,600 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| These townhomes we're proposing will be 1,400 to 1,600 at minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| We're also designing them to be front-load garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| similar to the houses with the same setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| so that there will be no street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| We're trying to make this as similar to the existing product as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| and try to make sure that we hold value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| As a developer, you don't want value to drop in a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| So it's just in our best interest as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| to get as high as a price per square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| and maintain the character of the subdivision as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| Okay, so you developed the whole project, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| and sold lots to Turner on the front phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| and he built his houses and sold to his customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| Was there ever a commitment as to what the remaining phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| of the property would be, whether they would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| I mean, the biggest question here was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| did anybody make a commitment to those homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| that it would be single-family detached throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| or was it just was there ever any kind of commitment or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| We had, from my memory, an overall concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| and then a preliminary plan that had phase 1 and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| and then we broke them in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Phase 1 was then designed, and that was proposed and sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| in one section to Turner Homes over multiple closings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| Phase 2, over the last, I think, 18 to 24 months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| that concept plan and preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| has been modified to do it in phases intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| because of the issues we had with the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| So us as a developer has never proposed anything to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| about what phase 2 would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| We had an option of what we were hoping to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| in the original concept plan, which we were just not able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| given the circumstances of developing the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| Commissioner Stelzner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| Mr. Mullins mentioned the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| So did you retain, like, the declarants' rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| for the first phase to put these together to maintain common areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| We do have the plan rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| On the first phase that you sold as well still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| So are they going to join together for the common area amenities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| Like, where's the mailbox area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| So our intention for that would be the use of a sub-HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| for the townhouses where they would only participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| in the maintenance of the road agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| and then it would be its own operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| because more than likely townhouses would have its lawn service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| So we would probably have it maintained as a sub-HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| where it would pay its share of just the common area roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| and improvements that it would need to take care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| which would be minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| So it would still have to work with the other HOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| It would probably work just for the basic level of maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| of the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Yes, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5419)|
| 1:30:27| Other questions for the applicant for opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| One of the comments was a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| and that the townhouses are in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| and the traffic would have to go through the single-family part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| It's not written down anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| but normally you want to put the townhouses in the rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| and not to the front of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| And so it's working out the way that if it was designed this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5461)|
| 1:31:09| in the very beginning, this is probably how it would be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| You put the single family up front and the townhouses in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| rather than the opposite way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| So I think people...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| I guess I really don't want to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| As a transition, if there's other lower density things around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| having the single family can help transition back to the townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| I've seen that before, multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| Can I make a comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| I would just say if you actually see the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| and you enter from the main entrance, you look where the property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| I would normally agree that you would want to enter first into townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| and then have the homes get larger towards the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| This section, though, actually the elevation change is dropped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| so this would actually give the appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| that the single family homes will be above the townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| So when you tier something, you normally want the smaller product lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| and then getting up to the larger product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| So I think visually in the subdivision it will be pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| The only difference would be that transition would be rear to front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| but visually from the site and how flat it is at a lower portion of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| will actually probably look better than having the townhomes elevated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| above the single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Yeah, I think basically I see this as just kind of a problem with the first builder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| not being fully in control of the remaining phases of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| So there's a chance for just miscommunication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| that these people expected detached single family throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| and they didn't have control of the back phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| I think ideally it would be great if it was all the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| but at the same time this is an acceptable use in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| I don't really know that we would have a good justification to deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| but I'll throw a motion out there to approve the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| and alternative design standards based on justifications provided by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| Knox County Public Works and their proposal will not create a safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| We have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, seconded by Commissioner Schelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5608)|

| 1:34:54| Applicant is Michael Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| Location, south of Farrington Drive, east of Rantham Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| Track size, .3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5703)|

| 1:35:17| for a garage expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Staff recommendation, approve the request to reduce a front yard setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| from 35 feet to 28 feet for a garage expansion subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| Applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| Applicant, give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| My name is Michael Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| I live at the requested address of 1328 Farrington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| The setback I'm asking to expand the garage by eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| I'm currently at 37 1⁄2 from my property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| so the 28 would give me just a little bit of margin for that expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| The last request is the thing that I'm asking for some lenience on about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| It's very black and white about having a tree removal plan that's accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5762)|
| 1:36:07| or tree preservation plan that's accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| If it's not accepted, the project would have to be abandoned completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| I'm in favor of doing everything within reasonable effort to save the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| but I would just like to try to get some flexibility in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| I want to give a few points for context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| I'm trying to expand the garage just because in our neighborhoods there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| a rash of car break-ins, so I want to try to get in the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| This is a very small garage, and even though this house, by the previous owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| added some things to the back of the house, there's no storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| So at this point, if I tried to squeeze two cars in the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| the only place I could have parked the lawnmower would be the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| There is a—and that's the main reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| I've spoken to three tree specialists and got different advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| because a week ago when the report came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| I saw that condition of needing an arborist to create a tree preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| I had one actually come out to the house this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| and he felt like it would be doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| I had another one who couldn't make it out, but he was a little more reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| You can see on the picture, the white tube and the pavers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| that's eight feet from the current garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| That's how far I'm trying to go, and you can see it's pretty consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| with the line of the other houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| In speaking to these tree specialists, one of them had mentioned to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| that under normal circumstances on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| if I did need to remove a tree, according to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| there wasn't an ordinance to prevent it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| and that there wasn't necessarily a permit that even had to be done to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| But at eight feet, it wouldn't be on any of the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| and the one who did come out said he felt like it was capable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| because it would only be coming up on one side of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| I do want to point out the report talks a lot about consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| with the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| When you look at the KGIS map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| most of the house's property line is very close to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| You can see that mine and the two neighbors beside us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| our property line cuts in quite a bit more than most houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| If it weren't for that, I wouldn't even need the variance most likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| because I would be able to get what I needed without that extra cut in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| I currently have seven mature trees in front of my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| so even if I needed to take one or two or even all four of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| I would still have more mature trees in my front yard than the two neighbors adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| My neighbor to the right has two mature trees and two very elementary trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| The neighbor to the left has two mature trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| one that was struck by lightning and is starting to lean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| and they have two very immature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| There are several houses in the neighborhood when I measured on KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| where their setbacks are 28, 26, and I even found some that were 24 feet from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| I'd originally tried to request a little more than 8 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| and I was instructed that it would pretty similarly be denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| so I went with the minimum of 8 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| That would be just enough for me to get the other car in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| I do have some safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Even though my goal is not to go after the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| I want to be able to make my expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| but these trees are large enough that if I tried to take them down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| they're going to be very expensive because of their proximity to power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| If one of them did fall, it would obliterate any house in any direction that it did hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| In my house, it would destroy all but one bedroom and everybody in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| The move will be costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| If I did try to remove it, it would be over $6,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| so it's not my goal to remove it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| but I just don't want to have to start this whole process over again if there is an issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| That's just basically my request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| is that I could either get that last condition removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| or at least get the wording softened to that I'll make the very best effort possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| to preserve the trees but not at the expense of abandoning the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| Thank you, Mr. Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| Any opposition on this, seeing none?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| I think that's a reasonable request to eliminate item number three as a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| of making it best intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| That doesn't do any good, so I think you'll do your best intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| to try to preserve as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| I'll make a motion that we approve the request to reduce the front yard setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| from 35-28 for garage expansion subject to conditions one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6028)|
| 1:40:35| We have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| seconded by Commissioner Eddie Smith to approve the request to reduce front yard setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| from 35 feet to 28 feet for garage expansion subject to conditions one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6041)|
| 1:40:48| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| Opposed? Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Thank you, Mr. Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| I wanted to say thank you to Jessie Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6054)|

| 1:42:23| For the record, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| My name is William Standifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| My family and I have been residents in the Hunter community for about 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6148)|
| 1:42:34| We live at 832 Clover Fields Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| Our property is one of many that will be directly affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| or impacted by the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| I've only recently become aware of the development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| although I see in the Braxton Development's response letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| that was released yesterday that several efforts were made to contact residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6177)|
| 1:43:07| Although after looking at the list of names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| I don't recognize any to be owners of property that will be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| or directly affected by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| In fact, the only one I did recognize was Ms. Kerwin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| who was in attendance here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| In addition, their comments have not been provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| so we don't know their thoughts on this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| The dates on the posted documents indicate that these final plans have only been available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| for two or three weeks, and we've not had time to fully understand many of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6224)|
| 1:43:51| And within the impact study or Braxton Development's response regarding our concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6231)|
| 1:44:00| so after speaking with many of my neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| I'm here on their behalf to express some of our concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| understanding that some of these were recognized in the response letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| First, the first issue is the loss of privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| Many of us have made considerable investments in our backyards in the form of patios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| water features, landscaping improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| We feel like large apartment buildings that encroach on our property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| will destroy the privacy and peaceful environment that many of us currently enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6269)|
| 1:44:37| and, frankly, is one of the main reasons we purchased the lots that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6277)|
| 1:44:45| Personally speaking, my wife and I, once we shoo the kids out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| plan on spending a lot of time on our new patio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| and we would really like the posted or submitted the view from our back patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6291)|
| 1:45:00| But it's very, very tranquil, and we'd like to keep it that way as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6300)|
| 1:45:07| Second concern is the negative effect it will have on our property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6307)|
| 1:45:14| That may be difficult to quantify, but I think common sense will tell us that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| you know, even if it's determined that it won't be negatively affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| homes that back up to private wooded areas are much more attractive to potential buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| than ones with elevated apartment buildings and balconies looking down on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| Third is the light and noise produced by high-density housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| that's typical from high-density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| And the last main concern we have is we would like to see, to the greatest extent possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| the preservation of the natural habitat, you know, home to a lot of wildlife that we enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6347)|
| 1:45:55| Not only that, but the more this habitat is reduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| the more we feel like our neighborhood will be inundated with pests such as rodents, snakes, and skunks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6359)|
| 1:46:08| So again, those are my main concerns, but we also have come to share some potential solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| and I'll step aside so Leona can share those with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| So my name is Leona, and I am a realtor and a small business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| And I understand that there's a lot of opportunity in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| and there's been a lot of people moving here and just sitting here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| listening to all the plans for Knoxville of all these apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| And I don't feel like we're even considering our school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| My girls can't even ride the bus because there's not enough space on the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| or there's, you know, all the overcrowding in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| But with that said, I just kind of want to appeal to you of, like, keep Knoxville Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| There's something special about our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| And I don't know if any of y'all have been to Elkmont and seen the fireflies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| In our backyards, we have those fireflies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| And so we just, it's magical, and we are asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| we understand that there's an opportunity to sell the property and do all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| We're just asking that maybe we redirect it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| and have the time to propose a higher standard of living or a higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| or equivalent to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| So our neighborhood is 500,000, 750,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| So maybe give us 60 days to be able to talk to investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| and see if maybe we can have a higher-end neighborhood in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| And also, you know, benefiting Knoxville in the level road area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| like, we would like to maybe have a greenway in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| Yeah, and just, I think one of the main things that we really are hoping for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| is to maintain the level of privacy or a natural barrier that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6464)|
| 1:47:51| I know that, I mean, there's, we haven't had time to speak with the developers, to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6471)|
| 1:47:57| But overall, that would be something that we would like to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| so that we can work out some way to benefit both parties with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| And make both sides happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Before Mr. Moulds gets back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| I just want to make a statement that Commissioner Scott Smith is recusing himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| He owns some property adjacent to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| and just out of a potential for conflict of interest, he's not going to be joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| Go ahead, Mr. Moulds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| Ben Moulds, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant, Braxton Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| With me, I have Mr. Will Ralph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| who is, I think, the Vice President of Development for Braxton Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| and Nathan Silvis, who is the Civil Engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| I also think we have the property owner, Ruth Ellis, on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| She is on vacation and Zooming in to speak on some of these issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6527)|
| 1:48:56| You may be familiar with some of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| that Braxton Development has done here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| They developed the Icon Hardin Valley Apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| which is a very high-end apartment complex there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| In fact, they're not on the agenda because it is only 12 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6550)|
| 1:49:16| but they are moving forward with a second phase of that development just up the road from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| So they are already invested in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| If you look at the elevations that were provided with the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| these are very high-end apartment homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| Some of them have their own garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| They are intended to feel as much as a home as you can for a multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6576)|
| 1:49:43| Now, this property is zoned OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| It was rezoned in 2021 last year by Ms. Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| The Northwest County Sector Plan already had this property designated to be office development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| so no sector plan was amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| It was intended to be some type of office development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| or this type of OB development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| As we know, OB allows for all the uses that RB allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| So as of right, there can be apartments there for up to 12 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| with absolutely no use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| Just go through the permitting process and have 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| The density proposed here is just shy of 15 units an acre, 14.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| It's a very modest increase over what we already have the ability to do as of right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6628)|
| 1:50:35| The property, I think the staff's report makes comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| We appreciate all the work Ms. Poitier has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| We've worked with her very diligently on trying to come up with a good plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| because this property is a little unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| A portion of it is also in the technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| It has to go through TTCDA approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| Normally we'd already have that approval, but there was an issue with the quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| so we'll have to come back later this month and go through TTCDA approval as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| That's one of the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| But it serves as a natural transition from the single-family residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| where the neighbors behind me spoke are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| towards the more developing commercial corridor of Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| That area has been transitioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| When it was expanded, that area is becoming more and more commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| You can see the red development there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| and there's some more PC as you further go north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| So this area is changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| and this is a natural transition from the residences that are further back forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| I want to touch on the issue of privacy because we want our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| They will want their privacy too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| The setback in the OB zone is 20 feet for any residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| If we go to the site plan, you see the building on the southwest corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6711)|
| 1:51:58| That's building number 14 where the arrow is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| That's the one that's closest to Mr. Staniford's home, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| It's set back 50 feet from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| There's a green triangle below it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| and that triangle is right adjacent to where Mr. Staniford's home is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| That's a non-disturbance area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| That area will not be disturbed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| So the photograph that Mr. Staniford showed with his backyard and the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| that won't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| It won't be that way even after this because there's a non-disturbance area on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| You go a little further to the north, there's another building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| That is set back 35 feet, even though the setback allowed is 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| So we're exceeding the setbacks along the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| Now, there may have to be some grading there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| and that will require some of the vegetation to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| But to the extent possible, we're going to keep the existing vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| One of the conditions that Ms. Portier has in the use-on-review recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| which we are completely in agreement with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| is that there's going to be a type A landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| That's the densest landscaping screening that Knox County requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| And so if there are any vegetation that's removed in that 35 to 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| between these buildings and the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| that's going to be replaced with this type A vegetative screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| Because part of this is in the technology overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| there are more stringent lighting standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| And one of the things that Ms. Portier asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| was that the TTCDA lighting standards apply to the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| Now, there were some waivers in the parking lot areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| for some greater lighting than the TTCDA requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| but that's still less than what Knox County's ordinance requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| And there is, by our photometrics, there is zero light at the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| There's no light spillage at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| And those photometrics don't even take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| the proposed screening and landscaping that's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| So with the trees that are going to be built up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| with the height, we're below the allowable height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| they won't see the residents in our apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| and the residents in our apartments won't see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| So I do have, as far as reaching out to the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| I know I'm over time, there's a lot to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| Ms. Ellis did reach out to, she owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| She lived there, she grew up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| And so she reached out to the people that she knew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| because I don't think there's any formal HOA there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| So she reached out to the people that she had a relationship with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| She reached out when they went through the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| She reached out to the same people when this was coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| And there was a card that went out 16 days previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| that had my phone number on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| and I didn't receive any calls on this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| So since Ms. Ellis was talking to the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| then that's the reason we didn't reach out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| because we thought that that was being managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| But we don't want this to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| We think it meets the minimum requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| exceeds the minimum requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| and that we would ask that you would approve the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Mr. Ralph or Mr. Silvis may be able to answer additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| Yeah, Ben, a couple quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| Has this been approved by TTCDA yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| It's got to go back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| They didn't have a quorum on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| so they're trying to reschedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| I think now to June 22nd, is that where we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| So, yeah, we've got to get TTCDA approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| But really the only part that's in the technology overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| is our clubhouse area that's along the boulevard entrance on the east there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| See, it kind of runs through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| The second question I had, my screen's freezing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| because there's so much information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| Traffic study mentioned maybe a second access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| There's a lot of density in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| Does it require two access points, or am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| We met with codes on that actually on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| and the boulevard entrance would satisfy the fire code for the two access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| and that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| There may be some additional design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| that will need to be approved administratively for that boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| It's not shown on the plans yet, but that's what we talked about on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| and that's acceptable to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| So we've got how many total units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| How many total units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| 315.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| 315.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| And where does the boulevard go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| The boulevard goes all the way down to Lovell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| It goes down from the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| There's a gated entrance with a turnaround there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| where the property of the flag pole kind of opens up to the flag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| and it goes all the way down to Lovell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| Again, the plans don't show the boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| It's going to be revised to have 18 feet on each lane with a 5-foot median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| And then you've got a five-lane section down at Lovell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| so that would handle the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| Yeah, there's not going to be any traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| coming through the residential neighborhoods to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7001)|
| 1:56:49| Any other questions for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| Can I just add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| Can I add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| Come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| I was rushed for my part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| and obviously we had 16 days and not very much time to really plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| and last minute I was elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| But, you know, you're talking about 300 and the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| and I still go to the overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| and talking about the school zones and Hardin Valley and Lovell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| There's already so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| My girls don't even go to the bathroom during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| because there's so much vandalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| and just overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| So, like, what is the plan for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| And there's also another apartment complex being built across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| whereas, like, just across the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| So I feel like there's several apartment complexes going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| So what is the plan for the school systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| What is the plan for the families?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| And I just would really like to know that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7065)|
| 1:57:46| May I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| And for the bus systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| I'm not sure, Mr. Mullins, you can address the school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| I can't speak to the entire school system, nor the bus system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| But, you know, this is zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| It's a weird zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| The property is zoned for Farragut Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| and I think it's zoned for Hardin Valley Middle School and High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| And, fortunately, I think a lot to Miss Kim Frazier's efforts here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7087)|
| 1:58:13| that there's going to be, you know, 32 additional classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| at Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| They're expanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| It's much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| But the impact, school impact, is estimated to be 27 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| once this is fully developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| And we know that's not just a net increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| You don't just dump 27 new students into the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| That doesn't take into account matriculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| and how that's kind of feathered out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| As people are leaving the schools, these students are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| So, you know, the impact to the schools are minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| But, respectfully, that's not really something that is addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| in the use on review standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| But it is something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| I mean, Knox County is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| Hardin Valley is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| Fortunately, they're getting some relief, and their schools are growing too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| I'd like to make a motion that we approve staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| which is to approve the development plan for multifamily development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| with up to 315 dwelling units subject to 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7149)|
| 1:59:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf, seconded by Commissioner Schelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| to approve the development plan for multifamily development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| up to 315 units subject to 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7166)|
| 1:59:32| Heard the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7178)|
| 1:59:48| I'm just moving my legs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7188)|
| 2:00:01| I know you all have been here for a while, but let's take a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7201)|

| 2:09:28| We're going to be doing additional...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7768)|
| 2:09:44| Let's start out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| This is agenda item number 39, final plat variants and plat approval staff is recommending denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7785)|
| 2:09:55| of both requests. File 5, SD22F, subdivision is resubdivision of Lot 1, final plat of acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7795)|

| 2:10:26| feet to 39.2 feet from the center line to the property line. Reduce the corner radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7826)|
| 2:10:33| requirement from 75 feet to 0 feet, intersection of Kingston Pike and Winston Road. Staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7833)|
| 2:10:40| recommendation, deny the variance to waive the requirement to dedicate right-of-way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7840)|
| 2:10:45| reduce curb radius needed because the conditions do not meet the variance requirements of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7845)|
| 2:10:51| subdivision regulations. The applicant has created their own hardship. Staff's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7851)|
| 2:10:58| recommending deny the subdivision plat because it is not compliant with the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7858)|
| 2:11:03| regulations. Mr. Ferguson, are you present? My name is Richard Graves. I'm here on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7863)|
| 2:11:10| of the applicant, Mr. Ferguson. We're not showing anybody signed up for opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| Is there anybody opposing? All right. You've got five minutes. Just give your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7875)|
| 2:11:21| address for the record, please. Richard Graves, 550 West Main Street. Believe it or not, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| think that this application to subdivide what is otherwise, you know, a relatively small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| parcel into two lots is probably the most interesting item on the agenda today from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| a legal perspective, believe it or not. And I'm about to tell you why. This brings up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7897)|
| 2:11:43| a doctrine in land use law called exactions or what you may know as the Nolan Dolan Doctrine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| or an essential nexus. So if you haven't heard those terms before, they refer to a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7909)|
| 2:11:55| as here where a property owner is part of securing a permit in a land development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7915)|
| 2:12:01| such as subdivision, is required by law or impose a condition to give up a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7921)|
| 2:12:09| or dedicate a strip to a community, you know, often takes the form of a right of way. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7929)|
| 2:12:14| so these are actually governed by federal law, which of course preempts whatever regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| we have here. And specifically, it's straight out of the Fifth Amendment's takings clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| that private property can't be taken without just compensation. And so as applied here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| the United States Supreme Court has in a series of two decisions called Nolan and Dolan has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7950)|
| 2:12:38| created requirements during which municipalities and planning commissions can legally require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7958)|
| 2:12:45| that a property owner give up land to the community as part of the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| And in fact, one of those cases started just like here. It was at a planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| at a town in Oregon. There was a shopping center that was going to be expanded. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| planning commission required the property owner dedicate a 15-foot public easement for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| a greenway. And eventually that went all the way to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| Court said that condition is not legal in this case because among other reasons, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7988)|
| 2:13:14| didn't meet the two requirements to require it. And so of the two requirements for a lawful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=7994)|
| 2:13:24| condition requiring a property owner to give up land is that the condition must be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8004)|
| 2:13:30| to address an adverse effect from the development activity that is the subject of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8010)|
| 2:13:37| So as applied here, for the subdivision regulation requirement that we give up property to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8017)|
| 2:13:44| valid, it has to be necessary to create, address some adverse effect as a result of subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8024)|
| 2:13:53| The land here contains two existing uses. They've been in operation since at least March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8033)|
| 2:13:59| There's a quick service restaurant on one and I believe an oil change operation on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| other. Their operation and use is not going to change just because we draw an imaginary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| line on the ground. We are seeking subdivision to allow separate ownership of these parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8050)|
| 2:14:16| But the intensity of the use is not going to increase as a result of drawing a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| on the ground. There's not going to be any increase in traffic. If you look at the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| report, the staff report absolutely doesn't contain any traffic analysis, which makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| sense because the facts on the ground, the use is going to stay the same whether a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| is there or not. Importantly, it is actually the government's job and not the applicant in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8074)|
| 2:14:47| context to prove any required dedication is necessary. So for this planning commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8087)|
| 2:14:53| deny this flat for our failure to dedicate land, the planning commission is going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| determine that dedication of property to add to the Kingston Pike right-of-way is necessary to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| cause some, to rectify some adverse effect. And to that end, I would just point out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| staff report in the comment section in item D, I'm going to, here's a quote, staff does not find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8108)|
| 2:15:15| it would be injurious to the public health, safety, or welfare to other property, close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| quote, when it's talking about this application. So there's a, it is clear from the record there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| is no adverse effect that is going to result from drawing this line on the ground that needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8127)|
| 2:15:35| be rectified by any condition. So the staff is recommending that we do not approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8135)|
| 2:15:40| subdivision because we can't show that we meet the requirements of either giving up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8140)|
| 2:15:46| required right-of-way or getting a variance from the required right-of-way, but the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| line is in this situation, the Nolan Dolan cases from the Supreme Court control, there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8150)|
| 2:15:59| facts in the record justifying that the property owner have to give up the right-of-way in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| context. And accordingly, there's just no authority for this body to impose any dedication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8164)|
| 2:16:14| requirement. And so in this context, granting the subdivision by way of a variance from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| dedication requirement is a perfectly valid way to avoid what would be an otherwise illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8180)|
| 2:16:28| application of subdivision regs in this context. I'm available for questions. I'm sure that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8188)|
| 2:16:35| unique thing you just heard. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill. Thank you, Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8195)|
| 2:16:44| Phillips. I'd like to hear comments, I guess, would it be most appropriate from staff regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8204)|
| 2:16:50| that specific matter? Ms. Porche, this is your item. Sure, the request for the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8210)|
| 2:17:01| dedication and for the radius to be dedicated as well at the corner, that comes from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8221)|
| 2:17:07| subdivision regulations. So if this body does find that the right-of-way dedication and the radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8227)|
| 2:17:14| dedication would be contrary to federal law, then that would basically nullify that section of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8234)|
| 2:17:21| subdivision regulations for any other plat. So I guess I'm seeking from also our legal counsel to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8241)|
| 2:17:29| kind of get their opinion on what that would be. That's a correct statement of the law, that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8249)|
| 2:17:36| there is a federal rule, then that would be preempted and this body would have the ability then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8256)|
| 2:17:42| as Ms. Porche stated. I agree. Just curious, and I appreciate these folks coming in, investing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8262)|
| 2:17:54| our community, and I advocated for the rezoning of this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| Why didn't they subdivide this on the front end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, also here for the applicant. They didn't have any intention to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8283)|
| 2:18:16| on the front end. This was something that came along later, that part of this property, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| entire property is owned, one of these is on a ground lease, and there was an offer that they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8302)|
| 2:18:28| not intend or seek out to actually separate this and buy it. And so that's the reason after all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8308)|
| 2:18:34| they came in and wanted to do the subdivision. That wasn't the intent on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8314)|
| 2:18:39| I will tell you that it can be injurious to our community when we are further subdividing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8319)|
| 2:18:46| small parcels. We have exceptions in the landscape and parking ordinance that accepts certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8326)|
| 2:18:55| minimums, and I just don't, you know, while we may not be able to do anything about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8335)|
| 2:19:03| I just don't. I don't disagree with you. Especially the intent, you know, we're putting two uses on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8343)|
| 2:19:09| here and we didn't, I think we had, well I can't say that there was an ultimate intent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8349)|
| 2:19:16| re-subdivide, but these were contentious rezonings. There's another one in Fountain City, and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8356)|
| 2:19:23| don't think that this is a way to, I just don't think it's a tasteful way of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8363)|
| 2:19:30| Thank you. I understand. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| Chair recognizes Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8373)|
| 2:19:39| I would have concerns in future uses of the property, you know, if you add another lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| the one that's, I guess, most farther, I guess, east on this map, you know, it doesn't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8384)|
| 2:19:50| driveway connection to Kingston Pike as well. So then, you know, if we subdivide this, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| technically a future use could try and get that. It might be kind of dangerous. So that's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| one of the reasons we might not have wanted to do it to begin with. So I think that I'm in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8402)|
| 2:20:10| of denying this. I may respond to that comment. We're in discussion with the Commission right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8410)|
| 2:20:19| now. If there's a request specifically towards you, then you can address it. Is your light off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8419)|
| 2:20:25| or do you want to make a motion or comment? If you don't care, I'd like to invite the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| counselor up there to address it. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| If I take it right, what's the concern about how to control what may be, you know, future effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| at these parcels now if we allow this to go today without subdivision or dedication? Is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8439)|
| 2:20:45| that's what I understood the question or concern to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| The concern is for another drive cut onto Kingston Pike in the future because it would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8447)|
| 2:20:55| separate lot. It doesn't have access right now. Sure. So this lot currently is, there are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8455)|
| 2:21:03| uses, principal uses are permissible as a matter of right under its current zoning provided they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| meet other requirements of the code. So there are other, you know, engineering requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| for additional access onto Kingston Pike. I believe there's also probably going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8471)|
| 2:21:15| be a state permit there if it's a state highway as well. If this land is subdivided in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8475)|
| 2:21:21| I don't really think there's any difference in a practicality standpoint from now as to how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| body can release any potential adverse effects from other items in the future. So for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| if, you know, these two uses are here as of right, right now, if the property is subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| and at a later point there has to be maybe a rezoning, you could revisit conditions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8499)|
| 2:21:46| potential new uses at that time. If there's something that is a special use permit that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| going to require, you know, some type of variance, that's going to trigger an opportunity to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| what may be adverse effects from the use at that time and to impose any conditions that may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8515)|
| 2:22:02| necessary to affect any potential uses in the future. But, you know, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8522)|
| 2:22:08| simply drawing a line as we're asking doesn't change anything either way in the sense that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8528)|
| 2:22:19| it doesn't give or take away any authority from the Planning Commission as it currently exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8539)|
| 2:22:24| to regulate what effects may be from this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| Commissioner Matus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| Well, I guess I agree with Commissioner Schelso. I feel like, and I wasn't around for the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| rezoning, but I feel like each time you guys come to Planning Commission on this, on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8555)|
| 2:22:42| it's leading to something else having to be done by the Planning Commission. And, you know, I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8562)|
| 2:22:50| like you've gotten great advice in the past, and unfortunately, because you didn't take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| advice, we're leading to other decisions that we don't feel comfortable making the decision for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| I would make a motion to accept staff's recommendation to deny the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8581)|
| 2:23:08| waive the requirement, sorry, deny the variance, waive the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8588)|
| 2:23:15| waive the, sorry, deny the variance to waive the requirement to dedicate right-of-way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8595)|
| 2:23:21| reduce the curb radius needed because the conditions do not meet the variance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| of the subdivision regulations, and the applicant has created their own hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8606)|
| 2:23:34| We have a motion by Commissioner Matus, seconded by Commissioner Scott Smith to deny the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| and right-of-way curb radius per staff's recommendation. All in favor of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8621)|
| 2:23:47| say aye. Aye. Hang on. I'm sorry. You're good? Opposed? Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8627)|
| 2:23:57| Chair will entertain a motion to deny the subdivision plat per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8637)|
| 2:24:05| We have a motion by Commissioner Matus, seconded by Commissioner Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8645)|
| 2:24:09| to deny the subdivision plat per staff's recommendation. All in favor of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| say aye. Aye. Opposed? Motion carries unanimously. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8653)|
| 2:24:24| All right, next is agenda item number 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| These are amendments to the Knoxville Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8666)|
| 2:24:35| Index B, Article 2.3, definitions, animal care facility, small animal to remove the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8675)|
| 2:24:44| during the day to change the definition of kennel, remove dogs and replace with animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8684)|
| 2:24:50| Commissioner Matus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8690)|
| 2:24:58| Yes, thank you, Chair. So we talked a little bit about this during the planning agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8698)|
| 2:25:06| meeting. I don't have any problems with replacing dogs with animals. The one concern I have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8706)|
| 2:25:15| regarding the use, allowing a kennel in the C-N zone. You know, if you look at other permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8715)|
| 2:25:25| uses in the C-N zone, they're very light use. And I remember when this came before the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8725)|
| 2:25:33| with recode Knoxville where we rezoned the city of Knoxville zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8733)|
| 2:25:39| a lot of the concern in the community was noise. And I think that's why that five-dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| limit and limiting it just to the day was created because of that noise for residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8744)|
| 2:25:50| So what I would like to do is propose to amend section 9.2 to the city Knox zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8750)|
| 2:26:00| to use the use matrix so that C-N is a special use for animal care facility small animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8760)|
| 2:26:10| and accept the change to animals versus dogs in the definition. That is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8770)|
| 2:26:22| We have a motion by Commissioner Matus, seconded by Commissioner Uten to amend the article to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8782)|
| 2:26:29| change from dogs to animals and in the, did you say C-A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| In C-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| C-N?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| C-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8796)|
| 2:26:36| To make it a special use, use on review. All in favor of the motion? I'm sorry, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8796)|
| 2:26:44| Thank you. If you don't care, I would like to ask Director Ahrens to come up. I'd just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8804)|
| 2:26:49| like to hear a little more history and context to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8809)|
| 2:26:59| How did we get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| Good afternoon. Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8820)|
| 2:27:07| We got here through, it was a, I'll cut to the chase. We had an applicant wanting to put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8827)|
| 2:27:14| small animal care facility in a zone that, and part of their business model was to house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8834)|
| 2:27:21| upwards to 80 dogs overnight. By the current zoning ordinance, that would place it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| under the kennel use matrix, which would be prohibited. They appealed that determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8847)|
| 2:27:34| to the BZA. I guess through that process, it brought attention to council and administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8854)|
| 2:27:40| and so we're bringing this before you to discuss and determine whether it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8860)|
| 2:27:50| What zone was that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| I believe it was in one of the C, I think it was CG maybe. CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8872)|
| 2:28:06| You did say 80 dogs, right? Not eight, 80, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8886)|
| 2:28:14| It was more than 10. There was quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8894)|
| 2:28:18| Less than 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| We'll say less than 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8900)|
| 2:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8901)|
| 2:28:25| We have a motion on the floor. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8905)|
| 2:28:30| Kennel's not a separate use from animal care facility, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8910)|
| 2:28:37| We're using the word kennel, but that's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8919)|
| 2:28:40| Is kennel a use, or is it just animal care facility, small animal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8920)|
| 2:28:46| Animal care facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| It's small animal or large animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| And there's a limit? So 80 could go into an animal care facility in CN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8931)|
| 2:28:57| With a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| I mean, right now, 80 in CN, animal care facilities permitted in CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8941)|
| 2:29:08| No, not that many. Overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| What's the limit now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| Mr. Aaron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8953)|
| 2:29:14| Once you hit your fifth dog and you're boarding it overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| you meet the definition of a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| Okay, so what we're proposing to do is to change animal care facility from a permitted use in CN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8961)|
| 2:29:28| to a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8968)|
| 2:29:32| It's also intended to allow for overnight boarding indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8972)|
| 2:29:38| For five animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8978)|
| 2:29:39| And it was five before, and not overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8979)|
| 2:29:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| So now we're saying that it's going to be more than five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8984)|
| 2:29:50| It can be overnight, but it has to be a special use in just CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8990)|
| 2:29:54| Okay, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=8999)|
| 2:30:00| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9003)|
| 2:30:03| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| Motion carried unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| Next is agenda item number 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| This is amendment to the Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9009)|
| 2:30:18| Mr. Buch or Mr. Moyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| Just a point, I've been doing this for about 35 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9025)|
| 2:30:29| and this is the first time I've been to an MPC meeting, so thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| We're glad to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| Actually, I think it would probably be more useful before you call on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9035)|
| 2:30:41| to speak to the representatives of the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| to talk about the policies that we're going to be putting in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| to make sure that we're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| And I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9049)|
| 2:30:50| To speak to the representatives of the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609?start=9050)|
