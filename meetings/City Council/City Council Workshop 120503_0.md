| 0:02:26| the decision makers up here that are working on this and diligently, and I just pray that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| you would give us ideas and new ideas and fresh looks. And I pray, too, that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| work together with each other and the affected bodies that we're working with tonight on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| this pension. I pray for your wisdom and your guidance. We pray in your Son's name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=160)|

| 0:02:57| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=177)|

| 0:03:31| He had another event in his district and he's on his way. We had, if we follow the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=211)|
| 0:03:41| let me say up front that I've been asked. There's some folks from the community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| want to speak that have some time restraints. So whatever the council's pleasure is, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| we want to suspend the rules to allow those that want to speak. And this is not, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| are just individuals. It's not the groups that we've been, you know, that we're happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| to deal with. Just so if we can limit it to that, if that's the council's pleasure, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| would, you know, entertain a motion. I move. Second. Okay. Discussion on that? If not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=247)|
| 0:04:16| all those in favor of suspending the rules say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. All right. Do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| have the, I guess I need the sign up sheet. I know Jim Jennings is one. Jim, do you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=263)|
| 0:04:36| to speak? Okay. First is Frederick Wagner. Are you a city employee? I thought, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=276)|
| 0:05:00| I thought you were. If we could limit this, if you don't mind, on the front end, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| the community folks. And then we'll let, I'm sure you want to stay to the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=304)|
| 0:05:13| So you understand what I'm saying? Folks that have signed up just from our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| and what have you. Okay. And I'll call on you at the end. Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=318)|
| 0:05:31| I can't really read it. Eugene or Reed perhaps? Avis Reed? Okay. Reverend John Butler? He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=331)|
| 0:05:52| said he would return. Okay. James Yearwood. I see him. If you'll give your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=352)|
| 0:06:01| please for the record and you have five minutes. I'm James Yearwood. I live at 1909 Winter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| Green, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912. Good afternoon. I'm here to speak. I am in favor of the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| hybrid proposal to go on the ballot. I would like to join the other taxpayers to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| on the plan. I believe it is important that we continue to have the best employees to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| provide the best services possible to our city. The plan is a reasonable solution and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| I would like to show my support to all of them at the polls when it comes time. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| been a volunteer for the police department in a neighborhood once since 1995. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| want the quality of city employees to change because of this decision. Please approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| plan. Thank you. Thanks for coming too. Next up is Mae Moody. You'll give your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=408)|
| 0:07:02| address and you have five minutes. My name is Mae Moody. I live at 1611 Murray Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=422)|
| 0:07:12| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912. Thank you for your time and consideration in letting us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| address these issues this afternoon. I am not a city employee. However, some of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| may know me as a volunteer in police services with the Knoxville Police Department. My husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| Jack and I have been involved with Citizens Police Academy as volunteers for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| I recently, I am a city resident and taxpayer and I certainly appreciate all the great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=459)|
| 0:07:48| work all of the city employees do. As we have been attending a lot of these council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| workshops and meetings on the city pension plan, I realize that a lot of time and interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| and dedication has gone into this issue. I do not want to think of making major changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| regarding the employees of Knoxville. This is going to be a difficult decision to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| and work out. However, I believe the hybrid proposal that Mayor Rojero and her staff have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| worked on so diligently deserves to be passed and go on the ballot so that Knoxville taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=499)|
| 0:08:27| can make a uniform decision and vote on it. I believe the employee groups and Mayor Rojero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| have agreed to a reasonable solution and we are here to show our support for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| at the polls. We have a state of the art police department and fire department with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| employees that every day and every night work to put their lives on the line to keep us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| safe and secure in our homes and our travel and every aspect of our lives. We should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| proud of all our city employees and give them our respect and dedication for the jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| that they do. Thank you. Thank you. Jim Jennings, give your name and address. You have five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=544)|
| 0:09:18| minutes. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Usually I'm Jim Jennings, 4004 Tassel Pike and a proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=558)|
| 0:09:26| resident of the city of Knoxville for 67 years, and I don't even want to go to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=566)|
| 0:09:35| I love Knoxville. Usually when I speak in public I have to have a bail bondsman with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| but I'll try to refrain. I do want to give a disclaimer. I do not know any police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| I met Mark Taylor about six months ago, and he's an Iraq veteran, and me being an AO82nd Airborne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=591)|
| 0:09:59| paratrooper, we had a nice conversation. The only thing I know about our Knoxville Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| Department is they will write you going 42 and a 30. So that's my only contact. But in all fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=605)|
| 0:10:16| in all fairness, I deserved it. The law is the law, and I'm reminded that I complained to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=616)|
| 0:10:26| about it, and he said, I'll tell you how to quit getting those tickets. I said, how's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| He said, quit speeding. So I've learned my lesson, Chief, and you'll not get me on AIDAir again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| I promise you that. I'm here because, number one, we talk dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=639)|
| 0:10:49| I'm a taxpayer. They've courted me to move my business to Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| I could get all these TIFs 24 years ago. I said, I love Knoxville. We're going to do business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| We've been able to hire youngsters and train them, and we have 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| We have a payroll of about a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| Most of my employees live in the city and reinvest that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| And the police department, they patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| I'm over there at night working, and they do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| I'm proud of them, and I hate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| I watch this on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| I'm the laziest man you know, so I don't drive down often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| And this is serious enough to get me down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| I don't even like it when these uniformed bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| And as I was driving down Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| and I see that young man with that weed-eater out in the middle of that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| cutting that grass, making our city look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| And they have to come before this council on our hands and knees to get two percent raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| I think you all misread the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| We're the solid majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| We appreciate what these folks do, and raising taxes don't scare me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| I pay a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| But it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| It's worth it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| When I had my heart attack at home and that fire engine, that EMT was there in two minutes comforting my wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=731)|
| 0:12:20| and telling her everything was going to be all right, it took two minutes to get up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| And my buyer lived way out in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| He has heart problems, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| And I said, You're an idiot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| So, Mr. Palmer, he's moved into your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| He's a city resident now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| It's easy to sell this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| Businesses will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| We've opened the new Cheddar's up, and you can't get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| And I think of that ka-ching, ka-ching, all that tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| And the only thing I ask you, this is way above my pay grade, this pension issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| But I know that you cannot in 30 or 40 days uproot these people and put fear in their families, their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=776)|
| 0:13:08| They already work extra jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| And what I do is I provide a first-class health insurance for my employees, and we're able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| And our salary might not be as much, so when they get tempted with another dollar, they go home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| and Mama tells them, No, you're not quitting that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| And these pensions, these police and firemen, they know this is a short career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| Even the U.S. Army, they know they burn these guys out in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| I mean, it's dog years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| It's 40 years when you're under that stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Every time they pull a car over, they don't know what's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| And just your blood pressure goes up, and these rotating shifts, probably none of y'all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| I don't know if you've ever done that or not, but you work first, second, third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| You don't know if you're awake or asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| Am I going to be able to go to my kids' ball game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Is my time up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| You're real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| If you don't care to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| But I'm not going to tell you how to do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| I appreciate this mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| She's thinking outside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Our guys know that you've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| I'm not even sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| I don't know how you're rolling along and all of a sudden you're scared to death you're going to owe $30 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| and somebody's going to have to convince me of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| But, you know, the market went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| The market will go back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| The problem is with the 401Ks is why I don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| I've got a different plan than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| It's pretty sweet unless you're 65, and it's like it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| And that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| So I think what Mayor O'Hare has done, Vice Mayor, is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| Y'all ought to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| And quit looking at all dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| There's human cost involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| And what's it worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| I'm going to leave one store that's going to take me 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| I used to be a greedy man, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| When I first started this business, I was going to make me $20 million and be one of the big guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=910)|
| 0:15:17| And when you start a business, it's from ding to dark 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| And I told my wife I went home complaining one day, and she's a fine lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| She's an angel, 49 years with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| But I said, all I do is hire people, and when am I going to make some money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| And she said, that's not to make you a rich man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| That's what companies do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| They hire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| And I've thought about that a lot, and it changed my whole philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| So what I'm asking you all to do is go deep thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| It's going to cost money either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Find out what they prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| They're the ones going to draw these pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| Everybody else works somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| You either got your pension or you're making your own like I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| But hear what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| And I have nothing in this except these are fellow people that work good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| I respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Without the professionalism of that firefighter, we wouldn't be sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| That whole gay street was gone if the wind had been going the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| And what they do is magnificent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| Police Department, they're good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| They've come a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| I think it costs about, somebody tell me, $100,000 to train one of these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| I don't want to lose people like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| So find a way to keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Find a way to keep them happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| They've already done more compromising than I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1009)|
| 0:17:00| Avis Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1020)|
| 0:17:15| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| My name is Avis Evans Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| I reside at 1604 Bickerstaff Boulevard in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| I am the Executive Director of the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| PARC is the liaison between the citizens of Knoxville and the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1053)|
| 0:17:43| Our purpose is to strengthen the relationship between the citizens of Knoxville and KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1063)|
| 0:17:53| I am here tonight to ask that you pass the mayor's hybrid proposal to be placed on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| so the citizens can decide on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| The KPD and the KPD training agency have been declared a flagship agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| by the Commission on Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| This accreditation did not come lightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| and it is very important that Knoxville has such accreditation for recruiting qualified citizens to the KPD force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1106)|
| 0:18:39| In trying to bridge relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| I believe it is imperative that we maintain highly trained, experienced officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1123)|
| 0:18:53| and we continue to have the best employees providing the best services possible for the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1133)|
| 0:19:05| Now, I don't mean to say that KPD is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| There's always room for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| But KPD's force is a professional agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| and PARC is working on a daily basis with KPD to ensure quality officers are retained in order to serve our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1159)|
| 0:19:32| If we eliminate a pension plan, we run the risk of losing good officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1172)|
| 0:19:40| which will ultimately harm the relationship between the citizens and the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1180)|
| 0:19:48| A high turnover rate is extremely costly to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| You don't want to solve one problem by creating another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| We don't want to create a situation where KPD trains officers for surrounding police agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1200)|
| 0:20:10| A good, defined benefit plan helps retain good officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| Another area of concern for PARC is maintaining a culturally diverse police force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| which reflects the community they are sworn to serve and protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| As of January of this year, KPD has 419 uniformed officers, 42 are female and 34 are minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1230)|
| 0:20:41| KPD needs to be able to compete with other agencies in order to improve these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1241)|
| 0:20:49| I believe that it's important that the plan the mayor and the employee groups have agreed to is a reasonable solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1249)|
| 0:20:58| and I would like for the citizens to show their support at the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you this afternoon for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| Please support the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1268)|
| 0:21:16| Councilwoman Pelo, are you going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1276)|
| 0:21:27| You're probably familiar, but if you'll give your name and address, then you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| Barbara Pelo, 8437 Cortland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| And I'm not accustomed to standing in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| But I really wanted to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| And I want all of you to be aware I no longer have any representation on the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1305)|
| 0:21:54| or any personal relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| I haven't talked to a pension board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| But I had the good fortune of attending the mayor's budget lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| and heard the proposal that the mayor put before us all for her budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| and have given a great deal of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| I guess you noticed that I've been sitting in on these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| This is not a new concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| This is not a new subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| It's not something new to those of us who have been concerned about the pension plan for many months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1347)|
| 0:22:36| and really actually for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| I want to particularly express support for all of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| You know, it didn't take long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Well, actually, maybe I had the good fortune to work with many of these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| that wanted to come see you tonight for several years before I was ever in the position to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1377)|
| 0:23:06| And I began to appreciate incredible dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| I began to watch the lights in the windows long after the hours they're paid to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1391)|
| 0:23:19| I just had some wonderful experiences with people in our neighborhoods, in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| And this is from all walks of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| You know the cold days when somebody comes out in the rain and picks up your garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| Those folks, we don't know them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| They are tremendously dedicated to us as taxpayers, as citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| They're dedicated to the face of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| And I just want you to think about them and how much they mean to you, to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| It is not the highest paid job in Knoxville by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| This is not private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| This is not, I always thought when I was sitting in your seat, wanted to run Knoxville like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| And I believe in good business principles, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Try to help my husband run his business in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| But at the same time, we have to remember this is public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| And it takes a particular kind of individual to commit themselves to public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| One interesting thing I've learned, and I'm sure you have too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| is that sometimes we are talking about generations who have committed themselves to this kind of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| Now, having this concern about our pension plan, its stability, its sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1489)|
| 0:24:58| before me and others for quite some time, I've been very concerned about how we're going to approach it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| how we're going to deal with it, how the taxpayers can come to peace with where we are and where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1506)|
| 0:25:15| We have extremely good advisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| You have a very dedicated pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| I have never experienced in the, I think, seven years I served on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| I have never experienced an employee who was only thinking of his comrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1529)|
| 0:25:38| if he was a policeman or a fireman or if he worked in the public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| I have never seen that kind of priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| I have always seen them to be very concerned about the plan and the fund as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| And I just wanted to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| So in listening to the mayor last week, I surprised myself a bit when I began to feel that under the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1558)|
| 0:26:16| given where we are, given what we must do at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| this hybrid plan is really what I hope you will find yourself supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1583)|
| 0:26:32| I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| I think that it fully extends the appreciation to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| It extends to you and to all of us citizens an opportunity to continue to have excellent employee retention and recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1600)|
| 0:26:54| I was here at a time initially when recruitment and retention was a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1614)|
| 0:27:04| It wasn't that long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| I know the concern about the cost of seeing our employees, in whom we have a huge investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1627)|
| 0:27:18| need to leave Knoxville because they couldn't afford to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| We don't want to be in the education business, in the training business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| We want to be in the business of taking care of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| so that they will feel a lifelong dedication to the position that they found in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| I really understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| I understand that you all are in a very difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| It's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Senator Stanton stood over it, finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| Many discussions and comments over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| But you have incredibly good advisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| I think you have an administration that has looked me squarely in the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| And I feel that they have come to the solution they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1691)|
| 0:28:20| Citizens can appreciate, can support, and can vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| And I really hope that you can support all these folks here who support us so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1706)|
| 0:28:34| Thank you for letting me speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1714)|
| 0:28:43| I think that concludes the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| And we'll go back to the welcome, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| I know you had a prior engagement in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| I'm glad you could join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| And I'll turn it over to Bill Lyons for a brief presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| And I promise to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| You've got a lot of discussing to do among yourselves with what we've presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| I know you'll have some new information tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Mayor O'Hara would love to have been here, but she's had a longstanding commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| She just couldn't avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| So I've expressed her regrets on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| What I've done is passed out another version, and this won't show on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| but you all have in front of you, of the hybrid plan we presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| And this is done after, A, talking with many of you and sensing your concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| and, B, following the discussion up here and reading the very clear message from council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| which is you don't want to be in a position, put future councils in a position you're facing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| which is with the big bill coming due that the assumptions that led,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| that had assumptions that underwritten it that predicted that we would not have this bill coming due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| You don't want any surprises like this to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| And as we prepared this hybrid, as we altered this hybrid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| we have been very sensitive to the fact that this council and this administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| and we think the public and I think it's the employees as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| realize we have got to attenuate the risk the future taxpayers face in this pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| I think that has been a driving force going into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| So in doing so, we also sensed in the last couple of weeks a real sensitivity to any automatic escalators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| That was very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| And when we said this hybrid plan set the amount of everything that's defined benefit up to 40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| defined contribution over 40,000 and had an inflator in there, that caused a lot of very understandable unrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| It was there to account for future inflation, but understandably this caused some anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| So after, again, talking with some of you and thinking about this and speaking with the mayor, we decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| and speaking with Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Swanson, we decided to pursue another solution to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| which is don't put any escalator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Put it at 40 and write what goes before the taxpayers in such a way as to allow future councils to adjust this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1856)|
| 0:31:05| if they wish, by ordinance, or if they wish not to, by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| In other words, nothing is automatic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| So that has changed the chemistry of this plan that we're presenting a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| So I want to talk briefly about risk here, because that's what this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| and I'm going to be very brief on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| This is about balancing risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| The plan we've put in front of you, in the constellation of plans that cities are considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| is about and makes drastic cutbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| We don't know, and there may be some, I am unaware of any comparable city to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| that has a pure defined compensation plan for its employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| So risk is being the first there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Risk is not knowing what the impact would be on the human resources end of this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| and I'm going to talk this as a business a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Risk is not knowing what would happen when somebody, when a new class of employee comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| who has got a vastly different payment plan than those that preceded him or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| So we want to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| That's risk that we're balancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| We've got some real unknown in going to a pure defined compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| How have we addressed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| One, by freezing this 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Two, by putting the COLA to be capped at 3%, where now it's got a floor of 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| And that is incredibly important and attenuates a lot of the potential exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| Third, and I think we haven't had a chance to talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| and I hope we all get to later throughout the evening, a 10-year vesting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| Now, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| That means an employee who's hired January of 2013 under a new system will not be vested until 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1958)|
| 0:32:49| That is a long time before the legal accompaniments of vesting take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| That's a number of election cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| We can pursue what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| That 10-year vesting, we think, is very important in attenuating the risk of something happening later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| and going, we're stuck with this plan for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| You've got 10 years where that could be adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| Now, what I'd like to do briefly is go to one other thing and then get out of your way, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| I handed you all out a couple of graphs, and I'd like to move to the second one since that's relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| That is the expectation, if you could get to the second one, Alan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| Is that what's up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Okay, you can't see the blue too well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| The flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Yeah, if you all can't tell in the audience, there's a very light blue line that he's pointing to right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| What this gets at is the expected cost of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| We've removed, this is just the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| The present obligations are now out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| They're constant regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| We know how concerned we are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| We're all concerned with the obligations that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| This will start in 2013, this new plan, as people sign up, and gradually the costs will increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| and this graph goes out to 2040.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| The most expensive, assuming, well, let's not assume anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| The top line, the blue line, is the expenses associated with the defined contribution plan that we have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| It is the most expensive to the taxpayers, making the assumptions we had, unless, and this is the key,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| unless the market performs really badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| I don't mean just a little badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| I mean really badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| The red line, if you could point to that, is what we would expect if it only performs at 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| That's under any historic record through all the downturns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| At only 5%, which is, of course, short of the 6.5% we based the original projections on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| this is going to cost the taxpayers less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| Now, eventually, you'll get to a point where there's some exposure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| I mean, if it gets to 3, if it gets to 2, you're going to start going a little higher eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| but unless we're in a very unusual situation, the most expensive obligation to the taxpayers is on the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2101)|
| 0:35:10| Now, as we all know, that's known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| That's the advantage, talking both sides of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| That is a known pay-as-you-go commitment that we can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| The other does involve assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| And I know I heard last time from many of you, we're real uncomfortable with assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| What we've got now is based on assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| These are much more modest assumptions, A, and B, I want to stress this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| the obligations have been greatly scaled back to what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| No rule of 80, no drop, higher retirement age, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| So I will just emphasize that we're talking about much attenuated market risk to balance against the risk of getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2141)|
| 0:35:49| unknown territory and how we reimburse our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| And we think that is the risk that has to be balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| That's a business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| It's always balancing risk and reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| And that's no different from that and taking it as a business proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| The final thing I'd like to say and say on behalf of Mayor O'Hara is all of this needs to be, we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| and should be about finding the point of common interest among all the competing variables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| and avoiding positional thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Positional thinking is putting a flag with defined contribution on one end to define benefit of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| This, by definition, is away from those positions and away from hardcore philosophies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| The common interest is this, reducing the taxpayer's exposure to the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| getting a reasonable amount of compensation for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| And our employee compensation should include a retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| This retirement plan is reasonable by all measures that one could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| Admittedly, it is probably richer and has more guarantee than that that you see in your private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| And that's where you balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| We're talking about public employment versus private employment, and there is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| And we invest in training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| You've heard, I'm not going to repeat all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| You all have heard that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| But there is, that's what we're predicating this on, the difference that mandates our investment in training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| the type of employee, the jobs they have, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| We think getting to the point of common interest is clearly in this hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| which is in the constellation, again, of reforms, pretty, is pretty extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| It is, it would put, that puts us out in where Wall Street Journal editorializes about Rhode Island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| and the great risk their governor took and took on, quote, took on the public employee unions to get a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| That was praised on the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, getting to a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| We're talking about risking some very uncertain territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| Finally, I'd like to say we have an opportunity to have the community faced with a very clear choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| The legislative branch, the executive branch, employee groups together saying we think this addresses our future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2278)|
| 0:38:08| pension obligations in a way that's reasonable, responsible, respects the taxpayer, reduces the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| and, yes, does not expose us unless we have incredibly draconian outcomes to the kind of exposure that we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2294)|
| 0:38:23| And I think it would be great if the employees in the mayor fields, it would be great if the voters later could see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| and have that kind of message, vote yes on this, we're all together on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| It would be a shame to have this become sufficiently divisive where you're entering in, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| what about the nature of public employment, and all the issues we've had, and have a muddled message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| and an unclear and divisive message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| Now, this is democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Sometimes you have divisive messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| That's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| We have to live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| We're not always going to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| But I will close by saying this plan with the ten-year vesting we think is very big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| We think flattening the $40,000 and leaving that to later councils, if they choose to, is very big and limiting exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2337)|
| 0:39:05| And we think that, for the most part, in most circumstances, this costs the taxpayer less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| That's gotten lost in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| This is a pension plan that is reasonable in terms of cost and risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| And I'm talking about this as a business proposition that you all face because you're responsible for making very large financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| decisions on behalf of the future of Knoxville and councils and mayors and citizens and workers who will be here later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| So I will stop with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Alan is here, and he can answer questions about these numbers when we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| I know you have other folks who are here to make a presentation that's been requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| so I will leave it up to you folks at your workshop as to what you would like us to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| Thank you, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| I will call on Joe Thompson and Morgan Keegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| We were asked to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| Again, my name is Joe Thompson, 6824 Lionheart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| We were asked by the council and the workgroup to come and give an update on the deferred compensation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| the defined contribution plan that the city already has in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| Let me first say that whatever the city decides to do, we're 100 percent for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| We don't have a dog in the fight, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| We're simply here tonight just to give you an update on what the city provides its employees in the way of the deferred compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2432)|
| 0:40:41| So I do have a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| I think that they're getting it queued up, and I do have some handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| The first thing I'd say is that the city's plan, what we know as the deferred compensation plan, is a 457B plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2447)|
| 0:40:57| Currently, there are 1,279 participants in the plan, so it is broadly used throughout the city employment ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2457)|
| 0:41:08| There are 1,234 participants that are currently deferring money into the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2468)|
| 0:41:16| so roughly you have, let's call it 50 retirees that still are in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| The plan currently has just over $29 million in total assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| For a comparable, on a comparable basis, that rates Knoxville very, very well with cities of similar size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2490)|
| 0:41:39| All the costs associated with the plan are borne by the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| There is not a cost that the city or the taxpayers bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| It's 100% borne by the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| Currently, the city matches $10 on every participant's paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2512)|
| 0:42:01| They match $10 on the first $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| Most participants, as long as they're putting in $20 of paycheck, are getting a $10 match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| There are 16 investment options in the plan, representing 14 asset classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| I do have a handout at the end that has a list of the investment options categorized by asset classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| It is a broad diversification of funds that the participants can choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| There is one guaranteed income fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| They do have managed portfolios that, as a participant, the way to think of the Goalmaker portfolios is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| as a participant gets older, they take less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| In other words, a 65-year-old who is in the Goalmaker program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| and I would say that there is no additional cost associated with the Goalmaker program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| As they get older, there is substantially less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| As they get closer to retirement, they don't have 100% of their money invested in equities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| and run the risk of losing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| That has been a very popular option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| We are actively considering adding additional investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| One of those investment options is a guaranteed income option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| which will allow the participant to fund, essentially, a guaranteed stream of income down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| Those are very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| In no way is it meant to be a substitute for the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| It's just a tool that is available and that can enhance the retirement income of participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| The investment options are 100% participant-directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| There are plenty of the participants that have 100% of their money in the guaranteed fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| and there are plenty of the participants who have their money in the Goalmaker portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| It is 100% participant-directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Of course, Jessica and Prudential, we provide assistance where we can, but that is a significant difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| If you look at the next slide, you'll see just kind of a breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| Who are the parties involved in the deferred compensation plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| First and foremost at the top are the participants of the deferred compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| Everybody works for the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| The city has a deferred compensation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| We'll talk more about that committee in a second, but the committee oversees all aspects of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| Morgan Keegan, we are plan consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| We'll talk about what we do in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Then Prudential, of course, is the administrator of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| If you look at the next slide, and I'm trying to speed it up to save time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| the deferred compensation committee is made up of seven employees from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| There is one representative from the risk management office, there's one representative from the law office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| and there's one representative from the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| Four members serve staggered terms and are appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| Two of those are uniformed officers, one from the police department and one from the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| and two are non-uniformed employees, again appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| I can assure you that there's broad representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| There's every intention of having broad representation from the various groups within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2729)|
| 0:45:38| The current members are Mike Cherry, Lisa Hatfield, Gary Eastis, of course, from risk management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2738)|
| 0:45:46| is our venerable chairman over here, Gary Price from the police department, Scott Callaway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| Brian Lynch, and Steve King, again appointed by the mayor or representatives from strategic departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2753)|
| 0:46:02| If you'll turn the slide, Morgan Keegan, what are our roles and responsibilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| Let me first say that we're a named fiduciary of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| We do have skin in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| We accept the fiduciary responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| We're honored to have the fiduciary responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| But I think it's important for our role, which is plan design, document review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| the selection and monitoring of the funds, we do have skin in the game and we are a named fiduciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| So there is no confusion about whether or not we're acting in a fiduciary capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| We know that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| We accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| We do quarterly review meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| It's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| The deferred comp investment committee meetings are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| We meet at a minimum quarterly and we go over the investment options and any issues pertaining to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2812)|
| 0:47:00| Our fee is, we disclose it by contract, a flat $25,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| And I stress flat fee because I do want to make a point that it doesn't matter if the plan grows from $30 million to $130 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2826)|
| 0:47:18| We don't make any more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Our fee stays the same no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| So when people come up and say, are you for, you know, well, don't you just want to have a deferred comp plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| It doesn't change our compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| It doesn't change what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| And that's by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| We wanted to have a flat fees disclosed on the participant's statement and it's completely above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| Prudential is the administrator for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| They do record keeping, administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Somebody's got to print the statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| They do investment education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Jessica Ellers right here, we'll talk about some of her accomplishments in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| Does an outstanding job with the participants in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| They maintain the plan document and they make sure that the plan is in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| Their fees are not to exceed 72 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| We'll talk about where it was, 96 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| But their fee is by contract not to exceed 72 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| I would tell you that last year their fee came out to be about 69 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| It is also important to understand that the participants pay Prudential's fee as part of their overall performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2910)|
| 0:48:39| And it is not a cost that is borne by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| From a plan highlight standpoint, there's definitely a lot that I think the city has to be proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| Over the last couple of years since we've been working with the city, we successfully converted the plan from nationwide to Prudential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| I would say, from my point of view, the biggest change is we got the annual fee from 96 basis points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2939)|
| 0:49:06| renegotiated it down to 72 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| And that equates to about $70,000 a year in savings for the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| And there's no question that that's real money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| We measure the fee, we benchmark the fee, and we hold Prudential accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| And I would be the first to say that Prudential has done an absolutely outstanding job of living up to what they said they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2963)|
| 0:49:31| We have, on the outset, we wanted to significantly increase participation in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| And we can't give enough credit to Jessica in her efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| Forty percent of the participants in the plan have actually increased their participation in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| If they were deferring five percent of their salary, now they're deferring seven percent of their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| That is a substantial number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| I do a lot of pension consulting, and I can tell you that is astronomical when you're talking about moving the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| And let's not lose sight of the fact that it's only happened in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| Prudential and Jessica have decreased the participants that had 100 percent of their money in the guaranteed fund, the fixed account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3009)|
| 0:50:17| They've decreased that by 47 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Those are individuals that were so shell-shocked with equities that just put 100 percent of their money in the guaranteed fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3020)|
| 0:50:29| The guaranteed fund, it is guaranteed, but it does have a much lower long-term rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3029)|
| 0:50:37| And we've decreased the eligible participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| Those are people who are eligible to participate in the plan that were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| These are new sign-ups, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| We've decreased that pool by 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| So the numbers speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| What the deferred compensation plan is doing is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| We've significantly expanded the employee communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| We've done educational seminars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| We've done investment updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| We reach out to the police department, the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| We do meetings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| We do updates on the investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| On average, we're doing well over anywhere from four to eight educational meetings a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3076)|
| 0:51:25| Jessica participates in retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| None of these additional events that we do cost anything for the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| It's something extra that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| And I would tell you that in roughly two years that 1,584 participants have actually attended our events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3097)|
| 0:51:47| So that is an outstanding number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| It tells you that people are interested in their deferred comp plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| They want to hear the updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| Jessica Ehlers has done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| In two years, she's met with 1,040 individuals on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| She's had 1,040 meetings with city employees in a two-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| Now, if you do the math and you look at 50 weeks a year, she's meeting with a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| I think that is outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| That, more than anything, is the reason why we're able to move the needle with participation numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3140)|
| 0:52:29| I would tell you that we have a lot to be proud about with the deferred compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| It is a tool in retirement planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| It's not the only tool out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| But it is very, very helpful for participants to have a plan that they can defer money in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| that the city matches with a good lineup of investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| We make changes to the investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| I can assure you that the deferred comp committee holds us accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| and we do make changes on behalf of the participants when we think it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| we make changes to the lineup where we think it appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| There is a tremendous amount of additional information on the intranet site in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| It's open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Anybody can see the meeting minutes, the investment lineup, the plan document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| I cannot imagine being more transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| And that was with Gary by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| But you can, there's a web address right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| We certainly have information on the investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| We have information on the investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| And 100% of the time, I can assure you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| there's never been a situation where a city employee has called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| unless it was 5 o'clock in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| that they did not get a return phone call from me to talk about the various investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| They're very responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| I would encourage any of you or the city employees to call us with any specific questions they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| regarding the plan or the investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| And as always, Jessica is meeting with the participants very, very, very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| and she'll certainly continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| So I was asked today to come and just give an update on the deferred compensation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| and talk about the ABCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| It's kind of like crashing two hours into 15 minutes, so I apologize for the brevity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| But I would be more than happy to answer any questions that any of the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| or any of the employees have regarding the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| Questions of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| Councilman Dall-Milken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| Yes, I'm just trying to understand how this fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| This is the voluntary port plan where employees can save in something like a 401K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Councilman, it is very, very similar to a 401K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| In fact, if it didn't have 457 status, which means it's not subject to ERISA because it's a governmental plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| it would look and feel exactly like a 401K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| So it is appropriate to think of it as it is a voluntary program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| but it is very, very, very substantially similar to a 401K plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| And I guess this leads me to the question of either in the hybrid plan or in the defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3317)|
| 0:55:25| would this plan take over the management of that funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| or is this just sort of a side story that we're not adjusting right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| It's a very valuable tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| So you can save pre-tax dollars, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| And grow them for your retirement, working on your own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| and you have a pot of money that's yours, I suppose, at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| That's certainly the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| Now, I've heard it going back to 2008, a 401K became a 201K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| I didn't say the size of the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Whatever the pot is, it's yours at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| It absolutely is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| And it's important also, you know, we provide investment consulting services for the retirees in the plan also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3358)|
| 0:56:07| That was, I think, part of the point was to say, you know, whatever the city council decides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| whether it's a hybrid plan or a defined contribution plan, you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| You have it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| And whether you're talking about matching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| This is a vehicle that we have that we can use in either one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| I mean, it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| I would tell you, while our fee does not increase with the size of the plan, Prudential's fee will decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3386)|
| 0:56:35| So as the plans grow, it gives us more leveraging power to go back to Prudential and renegotiate the fees lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3395)|
| 0:56:43| But it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| We don't necessarily have a dog in the fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| It doesn't matter if you do the hybrid plan or you do the defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| This is a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| This is a component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| And it's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| And it's very, very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| And is your role then to help design each of the investment packages you can select in that group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| In other words, whether you want guarantee or different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| We're very engaged with the investment lineup and making sure all the asset classes are represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| We're very involved with the designing of the Goalmaker portfolios, which have become very, very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| And, yes, we're very involved with the selection and monitoring of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| But to make we went from 44 funds in six asset classes to 16 funds in 14 asset classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3448)|
| 0:57:38| I mean, there is a much broader array of funds in the plan now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| And we're always looking to add additional funds where we think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| But, yes, we would continue in our role as consultants to the plan, whatever you all chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| Final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| And I guess it's hard to answer this because it depends on which of the 16 options or combinations you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| But is there any experience level that shows how it's doing on average in one or three or five-year pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| If you turn to the next, if you turn two more pages, it's not in the slide deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| But you have here a list of the investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| We provide this to the city on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| It's got a list of the investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| We compare it to the benchmark that we choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| We also compare it to the fund average category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| We do this on a monthly basis, so it spells out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| As you can see, the funds are doing very, very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| They may not beat it on a one-year basis, but they beat it on a three- and a five-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| And without getting overly technical, we look at risk-adjusted rates of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| So it's not just the rates of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| It's how much risk are the funds taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| You could have a fund that was up 60% last year, but it owned energy stocks and gold stocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| And the risk-adjusted return is out of whack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| Because it could go up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| It could be down 70% the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| And we're very, very confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| There's more of a volatility coefficient associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| And we're very, very sensitive to the risk-adjusted rates of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| I've got two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Number one, in other words, this plan could be a defined contribution plan for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| It is a defined contribution plan for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| With what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| And then the city could decide to contribute more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| I mean, that's as easy as Jim York's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| It's a software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Where's Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| Yeah, hey, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| It's very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| I mean, it's just a matter of whether or not the matching contribution is mandatory or discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| And then it's a payroll transmission avenue at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| I can't stress how easy it is to accomplish either one of the two options I think you guys were considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3597)|
| 1:00:07| Are there other cities that are doing this, just using this as a defined contribution plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| I think there are a lot of cities that are talking about one of the things I would commend the city for doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| It is having this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| We work with a lot of municipalities that don't want to have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| You mentioned Rhode Island or Illinois, and the list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| This is very commendable that you guys are having this conversation because I'm eminently convinced that there is a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| and it is fixable long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| You're not working with any particular cities at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| No, we work with other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| Some cities, we're in the initial phases of looking at their feasibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| We're in the process of bidding on several contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| And we work, certainly our firm works with other municipalities on their deferred compensation plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| It seems to be a hotter topic in the state of Tennessee than elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| But as you stated, your fee would be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Our fee is fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| It doesn't matter if there's $250 million in the deferred compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| Our fee does not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| So that is to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Keep in mind that as we were able to negotiate the fees from nationwide at 96 basis points to prudential at 72 basis points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3685)|
| 1:01:35| as the assets grow, we would see that fee come down for the participants as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3695)|
| 1:01:45| Seventy-two basis points equates to 72 one-hundredths of a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| It is, you know, we do benchmark it to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| It is a very, very favorable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| I can tell you that, in my opinion, prudential, it is more than fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| I think the service, the contractual stipulations that we put on them about increasing participation enrollment have certainly been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3722)|
| 1:02:11| And I can't imagine that we certainly think that that fee is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| Rest assured, what we didn't think, 96 basis points was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| So it stands to reason that if the assets grow from $30 million to $75 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| that we're going to be renegotiating that fee to get it to a more reasonable level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| And there's absolutely no reason to believe that prudential would not be accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| I'm going to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| While he's standing there, I want to hear go back to Bill's graph in the light blue line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| And you say the cost to the city of Knoxville will be greater on a defined contribution plan as opposed to the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3766)|
| 1:02:53| Yet he's saying there's no cost to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| Explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| This involves the city's eight and represents the eight percent and ten percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| And if the city is going to be involved in a plan, I'm sure, like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| without any city involvement and no cost, it's just an individual retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| Just the contributions that you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| And I could have been more clear about that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| We're just talking about the mandatory contributions to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| I talk about when I was referring to no cost, I was talking about the administrative cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| or borne by the participants, not the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| Councilman Dalbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| I'm trying to clarify something in my mind here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| One of them has to do with your fee, which is modest and sounds like it's well-earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| It just strikes me as odd that as assets grow and the more amount of money put in, you guys don't get any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| And I guess the question leads to do the mutual funds give you a partial percentage or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| Let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Our fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| How are you making money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Well, we're making $25,000, and I think that is a very reasonable fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| And sometimes I kid Gary that we probably deserve more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| I think if you go back and you look at the year that we converted the plan from nationwide to prudential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| should we have gotten more than $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Probably that year we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Because you saved money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| Well, we saved $70,000 for the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| There was a lot more work that year than in a traditional year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| But I'm very comfortable that $25,000 is a reasonable fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| We do not receive any compensation from any of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| Our fee is billed to prudential and is paid by invoice to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| And we certify that that is the only fee that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| The second question, or the last question, is I'm looking at the you pointed to those pages where you have the different funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| large cap, small cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| And the performance in the three and six-year phases seem higher than when I turn the page to the Goalmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3895)|
| 1:05:04| which is more like in the three or four percent range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| Some of those funds were performing much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| How do you explain the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Well, the Goalmaker is a diversified portfolio that's going to encompass virtually all the asset classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| And it's designed to, like Bill was saying, to control risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| It protects the principal and the growth tends to be modulated down a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Well, it tends to spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| There's no protection, but it tends to spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| It spreads the risk out over more asset classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| What you see is that over time their performance is more stable than it would be if you just had, for example, a large cap growth fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3940)|
| 1:05:50| That's going to be more volatile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| It is significantly more stable when you look at it over an extended period of time than just owning one fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3952)|
| 1:06:00| Because different classes do differently in different years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| And so one year it's bonds and the next year it's large cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| You know, it's one of the things that we watch is, and there actually is a report from Prudential in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| that, you know, it's really easy to look and say small cap value did the best last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| or the large cap growth fund is where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| But you have to look at it over a five and ten year period because there's going to be some times when that fund underperforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| and you can't chase performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| The gold maker portfolios make that virtually impossible by owning virtually all the funds in the lineup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3989)|
| 1:06:37| and by spreading the risk out over a larger number of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Mr. Vice Mayor, I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| With the committee, when you make decisions on what you're going to invest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| do you discuss this with the committee prior to or do you make investments and then it's discussed with the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4013)|
| 1:07:01| We discuss everything with the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| The committee votes as to what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| So there is typically what we would do is we would put a fund on watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| and then we would vote to remove the fund or keep the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| It is a democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| I suspect that they would take our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| but let me be clear, nothing is done ever without the approval of the investment committee by vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4044)|
| 1:07:34| Now, the people who roll on and off of the committee, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| and I can think of any training, but do they have any type of new people come on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| I guess I'm asking, do you have some type of discussion of their duties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Oh, very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Keep in mind, the committee has only been in place for two years, and so we had two-year appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| And so, I mean, Buddy just rolled off and Joe at the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| So, I mean, we have had some employees roll off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| and we do have a discussion either before they're appointed or before they're selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| Lisa Hatfield, for example, came from the law department when Sharon Boyce retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| When Sharon rolled off, Lisa came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| We certainly have that discussion about what the duties and the roles and responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| And that's going to be an ongoing conversation that we have with the committee members as they're put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4104)|
| 1:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Just as a follow-up, and everybody that's on the committee is participating in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4113)|
| 1:08:42| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Yeah, I couldn't swear to it, but they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| You know, that's actually a very fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| But, you know, again, I guess technically you could have somebody that was appointed or selected that didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| but I think it's in everyone's best interest to have somebody who's, you know, who's got skin in the game, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| Let me recognize Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Yes, Alan Pennington, actuary for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| Just want to make a quick point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| As the current hybrid plan is designed, it's a little bit like the G-1 plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| which is a type of a hybrid that has a defined benefit component and a defined contribution component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| And all the assets are combined and invested as one, even though it's tracked separately for purposes of the account balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| The current DBDC plus hybrid that's being recommended would work much the same way as it's currently designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4174)|
| 1:09:42| which is all the assets would still be in one pool and invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| They would be broken out into accounts for purposes of tracking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| but it would be available to convert as an annuity at retirement and would still be all one of the same pot of assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| and would not, as it's designed currently, be available to put in a 457 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4199)|
| 1:10:08| Are there other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| Let me try one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| One more question, Mr. Thompson, and we're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| We have been struggling with, when we look at the defined benefit plan, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| one of the things that we struggle with is the assumption of what can it gain on average in a particular year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| And I guess I'm wondering, you have a track record of one year showing in the back on that Goalmaker thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| How do you look at a reasonable return over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| We'll have more data points over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| The Goalmaker portfolios started when the plan started two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| So, you know, they started, I guess, April of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| So we really only have one-year returns, and we'll have three-year returns in another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4252)|
| 1:11:01| But we monitor the funds inside the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| And we're very cognizant of the performance of the Goalmaker portfolios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| But it's going to take more time to get more data points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| So it's not running in some other environment where it may have more years of experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| They're actually, the way they track performance, they're created individually for each plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| based on the funds that are available in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| And so it has to start when the program starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| I would say that the portfolios are designed by Morningstar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| And we certainly have capital market rates of return that you would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| And I would say the Goalmaker portfolios have done very, very well, based on the assumptions that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Mr. Thompson, thank you for coming and staying until 639 after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| We're going to go to council discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| I'd just like to take a moment, if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| and just thank the administration and the employee groups for the hard work that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| I've been here before and done this, and this is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| I mean, I've never seen the groups work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| I just want to commend people because pensions and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| when you start messing with that, it's just a really, really hard thing to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| But I just want to say that I'm in total support of what the administration is bringing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| I think it's the right thing, not only for the taxpayers but for the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| And as presented, you know, I think that this is a very reasonable plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| and I just appreciate how we've gotten there to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| Now, it doesn't mean that that's going to be the final product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| but I think that that's the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| The other end of jumping off the cliff, in my opinion, humble opinion, it's just too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| It's just too opposite-ended to be able to, for me, to swallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| So, you know, again, I think it's a very fair mix for the employees and the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| And at a minimum, you know, the uniformed bodies and the work that is done out in the field is tough work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4396)|
| 1:13:26| And it's different work from what I do and probably what everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| You know, when I sit in my office, I don't, you know, have a fear that I'm not going to go home that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| I mean, I'll be honest with you, I may get killed in a car wreck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| but in the line of duty, I feel pretty comfortable sitting and doing what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| So you can't really, in my mind, compare business, normal business outside of government to what our folks do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4424)|
| 1:13:53| And that's, you know, another reason that I think that it should be handled differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| and we should keep going down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| You know, and again, it took $100,000, I think, was what Chief Roush said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| $60,000, what Chief Sharp said, to train an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| And it just starts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| I mean, that's just the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| When we put them out on the street, we've got to equip them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| and we've got to, you know, do all the things that we have to do, uniforms and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| And to do that and train them and then to see them go is just a huge disservice to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| because this is all done on the taxpayers' back because they're the one that's paying the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| So, you know, we talk about risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| I think there's a risk by not supporting the employees with this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| and have them stay, have them be comfortable and not have to worry about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| and do the job that they're hired to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| So I think that that's very important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| And then Dr. Lyons hit on something that he and I have been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| We've got five, basically about five more two-year cycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| before anybody even vests in what the voters are eventually going to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| So we've got time to be able to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| I see Ms. Hatfield out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| I don't want to put you on the spot, but I'm going to a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| I know you probably can't answer with certainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| but I'm sure with the help of Mr. Swanson's team that you all could in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4519)|
| 1:15:26| or I feel confident that you could advise new hires coming in that there's a disclaimer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4526)|
| 1:15:34| or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| We actually do, for all new hires, every new hire has to go through a new hire orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| At the latest, it's going to be within 30 days of their hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| It's usually sooner than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| I think we're actually doing them every two weeks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| We actually do have pension come to that new hire orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| and do a presentation for all new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| So right when they're hired, they're told how the pension plan works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| They're told when they will vest, what their options will be, what things they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| They do their paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| They sign receipt of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| So we already make sure that all employees are given that information when they're hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| That will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| We'll just change that information that they're given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| Well, that's fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| But, again, I just want to stress that we've got a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| We've got a minimum of four two-year cycles and closer to probably five two-year cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| So, Dr. Lyons and all the employee groups, I want to thank you for where you've taken it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| And I've listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| I haven't said much during the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| But I just want to say I think we're getting close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| and I'm supportive of what the administration has brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I, too, have been fairly silent because last week I couldn't talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| But I do have a lot of concerns about the path we're taking and the proposals that are on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| Risk is in everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| And I am very, very concerned that moving to a defined compensation plan is very risky for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4626)|
| 1:17:16| and it's also a very radical move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| I have also looked at the information we've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| I've gone online, checked around, and lots of cities, lots of counties are talking about plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| But I'm not seeing anybody rushing down the pathway to go to a defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| or deferred compensation plan because it is extremely risky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| It's risky for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| It's risky for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| It's risky for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| And the taxpayer risk comes if we take that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| We're going to have to seriously look at and do something about our compensation for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| because part of the compensation package includes these benefits of a retirement plan as well as the health and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| So if we take the path, the radical path of deferred compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| then we're going to have to look at some really serious examination of the compensation excluding the benefit package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4693)|
| 1:18:21| because people are not going to come to work for the city at the rates that we pay for many jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| whether it's a uniformed officer or someone who is doing other tasks that we expect to have occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4707)|
| 1:18:35| Those people are not going to want to come and work here if they don't have some care at the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| I think the mayor has looked at the issue and her advisors very, very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4722)|
| 1:18:49| and they have pulled the best of all the worlds together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| Is it perfect? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| There's not going to ever be a perfect plan for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| But what it does is take into consideration that those employees who are paid the least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| and have the least amount of money available to look toward a retirement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| if it's a defined compensation, those employees are going to have a really tough time making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4752)|
| 1:19:20| I think Ms. Hatfield told us a couple of meetings ago, somebody brings home $240 every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4760)|
| 1:19:28| Perhaps that person has a couple of kids or maybe it's just a husband and wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| They don't have a lot of money, and the last thing they're thinking about is retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| and putting money into a retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| We ask our employees to do very difficult tasks in many instances that physically are very, very demanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4780)|
| 1:19:51| and are not the kind of tasks that a person can continue to do at 60 or 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| I've had firefighters come to my house for emergency calls to help someone who had fallen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| and I was really pretty glad to have a younger person there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| because it was not a lightweight that they were helping pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| I've had police officers come to a business not here but someplace else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| and I was always glad when there was someone who was fairly young and agile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| And I'm not taking a hit at those who are seasoned because we need seasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| Unfortunately, I fall into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| But what we need is that whole variety of experience and history that comes with a retirement plan that considers everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4830)|
| 1:20:42| I think that the $40,000 salary level to then go to another plan, I think that's very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4842)|
| 1:20:54| But I'm flexible on some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I will say that the drop plan was something that was very foreign to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| The rule of 80 was not anything I had ever experienced or heard until I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| I thought it seemed like a pretty good idea, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| But I also think that that's probably something that, like many plans whose time has come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| when those rules were adopted 20, 30, 40, 50, how many ever years ago, they were great ideas at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| But, as you know, we live in a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| I think that Morgan Keegan and Prudential do a fine job for what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| but I really don't think that they are going to provide the total answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| So I'm going to be supporting a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| It may look exactly like what Dr. Lyons identified tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| We may tinker with it and toy with it, but I think that that's the plan that the voters will most support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4902)|
| 1:21:50| I've heard from people, maybe not as many as some of my colleagues, but I've heard from a number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| and I find that the wealthier you are, the more likely you are to support defined compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4917)|
| 1:22:07| The more you work with your hands or you work in a job that might cause you to sweat outdoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| or might just cause you to not be as comfortable, you're looking for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| And until we can get our pay levels to such a point that everyone can easily afford to contribute to a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4939)|
| 1:22:29| put food on their table, shoe their kids, and have a little extra money to go to Dollywood or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4949)|
| 1:22:36| I think that we need to follow the hybrid plan and work on that and hash out the differences in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Thanks, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| I think that what we've done, we've agreed conceptually anyway to set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| and to freeze their current pension plan and look for a new option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| And Dr. Lyons has presented a couple options unbeknownst to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| He came back with a revision. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| I, too, have come tonight with my own revision to their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| There's several things that concern me about I can support a hybrid plan if some of the switches, what I would call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=4997)|
| 1:23:27| some of the controls are left back to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| The COLA ought to be reviewed by the administration and ought to come back to council for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| If we had the money, we would put more money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| If we don't have the money, then we would not be able to offer raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| And same with the increases each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| Those things are toggle switches that the council are part of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| If you have the money, then you can afford it and you would buy into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| I think the $40,000 is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| It's too high and puts too much risk back on this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| I think the city should support some type of risk on a pension plan for their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5044)|
| 1:24:11| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Their estimations, I think, is at 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| I think pulling the number down to $20,000 for an employee, for a government employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| and $25,000 for your fire and police would make this more reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| Starting salary is $31,000 for a policeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| So I think there's a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| I think you can adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| The other thing that you can adjust is the amount of time it takes to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| Now, I think for your average government employee, I would recommend 65 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| These are the things that you can adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| And you can adjust this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| You can adjust it by, you know, if you leave it out and you write it as we've been told all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| if we write it the way we want it, we can change it by ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| and not to be subjected into the charter where it's automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| So I think that we could work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| I think you can work the details out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| And he came tonight with one of the suggestions that I had, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| I think there's even more control that this body ought to have in regards to the amount of money as it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5112)|
| 1:25:20| So here's my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| I'll submit it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| I took his style, and I basically just copied it, copied the way he presented it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5122)|
| 1:25:31| And it just toggle switches some of the things we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5131)|
| 1:25:39| You know, I think it's got to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| It's got to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| And it's got to be sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| And we've got to find something that will meet all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| And I think, you know, if we set it right, if we can't have those controls at this level through the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5148)|
| 1:25:59| then I can't support a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| Well, I do support the recommendation made in the new Sentinel editorial this morning, the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5170)|
| 1:26:17| And let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| That really does take us to a known position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| All the defined benefit plans, no matter what you look at in terms of the charts, we really do not know what our liability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5184)|
| 1:26:36| Last year, the 2011, end of June 2011, our plan liability, our total liability in our current plan was $590 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5196)|
| 1:26:51| We had $468 million worth of assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| We now have $460 million worth of assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| And that was at an assumed rate of 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| We lowered that assumed rate to seven and three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| And that gave us a total liability of $645 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| We still have $460 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| The difference is $185 million, which we are liable for, we, the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| If you run that down to five and three-eighths percent, which is, if you look at the 20-year average of the growth in our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5245)|
| 1:27:33| that's about what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| That gives us a total liability of $775 million, or a difference of $305 million that the taxpayers are liable for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5256)|
| 1:27:48| If we do a defined contribution plan, we know exactly what our liability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| It doesn't fluctuate with the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| We know every employee is going to get in the plan that's suggested, the defined contribution plan, 6% from the employee, 8% general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5275)|
| 1:28:07| and 10% in the uniformed services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| That's either 16% or 14% for those two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| I think that is very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| As a matter of fact, that is a fairly rich plan, actually, whether you compare it with other governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| or certainly with the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| I was going to clarify a quick point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| The total return over the 20 years was about 7.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| And that's the return that we were assuming over that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| So we actually did make the return assumption over that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| 5.6 is just the component of that total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| So I don't really think that's an appropriate number to use for this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| That's the number I'm going to stick with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5331)|
| 1:28:59| What is the 20-year return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| The 20-year total return was 7.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| That includes inflation and includes backing out the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| The 5.6% is the real return component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| That's one component of the total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| It's not the total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| Let me bring order back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| Councilman Saunders has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| I appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| I don't agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| The new GASB rule is going to suggest that we actually realize whatever the real rate of return is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5368)|
| 1:29:36| which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| If, in fact, that occurs, whether it's suggestion or real, I mean, whether we have to realize the liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5378)|
| 1:29:46| our total liability is going to be up around $900 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| Now, I have a great discomfort going to our taxpayers and saying, you're on the hook for whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5391)|
| 1:29:58| whether it's $130 million, $185 million, $305 million, $600 million or $400 million, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5398)|
| 1:30:07| It's an enormous number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| Even if we smooth it out over so many years, people keep saying, well, $20 million, that's just next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| That's not our total liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| That's a smoothing effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| So if you go with the defined contribution plan, if we ask the taxpayers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5421)|
| 1:30:29| or the voters to consider that this year and they accept that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| that doesn't mean that if things get a whole lot or change a lot, and hopefully for the positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| that we can't come back in two years, four years, six years, eight years and make additional changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| But if we start from a higher base, the $40,000 or $25,000 or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5443)|
| 1:30:50| we have locked ourselves in without really knowing what our liability is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| Mr. Pennington can't tell us what that real liability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| He can make projections based on various assumptive returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| But, in fact, we really don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| With the defined contribution plan, you do know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| And we can tell the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| And so when we go back, and we're dealing with part of the plan here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| because we've already said to the employees that are here now that we're not going to affect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| You are going to be on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| This is for anything going forward after some certain date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| maybe January 1st of next year or whatever date is picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| But I'm very uncomfortable, and, therefore, I do support the defined contribution plan straight up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| Councilman Starr, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| I'm just still confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| What is our 20-year rate of return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| The rate of return that we would compare to the seven and three-quarter percent assumption over the same period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| In other words, we assumed in the valuation seven and a half percent for a period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| Well, when you say what the correct number is, it depends on what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| I'm just trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Here's my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| If I have $100 and at the end of the year I have $105, then I think my rate of return is five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| 7.8 percent is the right number then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| By that analysis, 7.8 percent will be the 20-year return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| Well, but I still only have $105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| I don't have $107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| In that scenario, five percent would be the real return, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| So I'm saying if that's your definition of how to define return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| if the definition is you look at the number at the end of the year compared to the beginning of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| in your scenario it's five percent, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| If you apply that same methodology to the 20-year return of the pension plan, it would be 7.8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5567)|
| 1:33:04| I'm still confused on how inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| I mean, you have how much money you have at the end of the time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| If inflation was zero during your example, then you have $5 more of spending power at the end of the year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5590)|
| 1:33:18| You could buy $5 more with the goods and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| If inflation was five percent, then you can't buy anything more at the end of the year than the beginning of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5600)|
| 1:33:27| because everything has been inflated five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| That's what inflation is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| So wouldn't that drive the number down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| Wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| If you count inflation in, then it seems like it would drive your number down, not up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| because your dollars, your real return is, let's say, let's just keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| One year, five percent return on $100, and inflation is two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| At the end of the year, you have $105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| How does a two percent factor in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| How could you say, I mean, so you're telling me it sounds like you're saying that that's a seven percent return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5640)|
| 1:34:07| because inflation is two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| You don't add it back in again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| You either start with the components and add them up, or you start with the total and back it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| In your example, five percent would be the total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| And did you say two percent was inflation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| So then three percent would be the real return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| So two percent, you know, three percent real return, two percent inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| that means at the end of the year you've got a total of five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| What's the real return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| The real return in that example is three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| You've got two percent inflation, three percent real return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Okay, I think I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| In my example, the 20-year real return is 5.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| Inflation was about three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| And then there's also an expense component because you want to back out the cost of expenses being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| But it ends up netting out to about 7.8 percent when you add those numbers together, the total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| I beg your pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| On your own report, investment return, 2011 study, historical real returns, Knoxville, 20 years, 5.6 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5705)|
| 1:35:15| Market returns, 80 years, 6.23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| Average real return, 5.91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| It doesn't mention inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| Well, if you turn to the next page, I think you'll see where inflation is being added on to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| No, historical returns, 591.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| Market expectation, 467.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| When it comes up with the total expectation, it adds inflation back into that and subtracts out investment expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5732)|
| 1:35:39| Yeah, well, I must say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| On the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| The point is our fund is not as large as it was at the beginning of our year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| It's down by $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| Now, I understand well that we take in and we pay out $40 million plus and we add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5751)|
| 1:35:59| and there's a market appreciation and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| But the total corpus is less than it was at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| And that's what I call return, exactly what Mr. Starr was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| If I start with $100 and at the end of the year I have $95, I've had a loss, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5770)|
| 1:36:18| better than a 5 percent loss, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Or if I've made $5 at the end of the year, I have $105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| And I understand income and outgo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| With respect to everybody's time, I'll be happy to meet with you one-on-one after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| and go over all these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| I mean, I've tried to put it in simple terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| I'm not sure I can make any more progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| I was actually going to ask the same line of questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| And I looked at your annual report, the full-length report that you put out as of July 1, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5808)|
| 1:36:56| And in the report and in your experience report as well, you have four columns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| I'm going to make up four dumb columns because I don't have time to write it out or project it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| But one was called the real rate of return, and that's what they were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| One was called the administrative cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| That's the cost of running the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| The third column was an inflation factor for that particular time frame, and that was in the third column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| And the fourth column had a total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| Now, there's really a definitional problem, and maybe we can all understand what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| When you say the real rate of return, I hear FINBAR saying that's what I actually earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| You may be saying that's what I actually earned, less inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| I don't know what your definition is, but I understand that there was something called the rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| You called it the real rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| You take out a half a percent as the cost of administering the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| That makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| And that's the debate I heard what Marshall was saying before that you add back in to get a total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| So I think it's a definitional problem, and to help us understand it, what do you call the real rate of return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| What does that mean in your field of expertise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| Because I think that's where the confusion is coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| Is that earnings less inflation, and then you add it back at the end to get it in inflated dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Well, the real return is the increase in buying power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| So how much increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| So you account for inflation then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| If you put inflation in, then that's the total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| It may be easier to define total return first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| Okay, do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| That's the last part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Let's just ignore expenses for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| Ignore benefit payments and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| The total return, if you have $105 at the end of the year and $100 at the beginning of the year, the total return is five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5922)|
| 1:38:49| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| That's five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| Now, what was inflation during the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| But he said if it was two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| It's two percent inflation, then that means you've got less buying power, so you've got three dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| Three percent, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Three percent real increase in your buying power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| So that three percent real increase would be comparable to the 5.6 percent that you see in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| And when you talk about the 7.8 percent, what does that number reflect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| Is that buying power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Is that simply growth in the number of dollars in the pot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| It's the total growth in the pot minus expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| Everyone understands the expense part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| That's just the cost of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| But if I say 7.8 and I say, well, if I don't back out the expenses, then I'm talking like more 8.3 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| So the 7.8 that you say you're left with, that's an absolute number of earnings or that's buying power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5977)|
| 1:39:45| That's the absolute total earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| In buying power, it might be less because inflation has reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| You know, I think the one thing I've learned in the last four workshops, and this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6000)|
| 1:40:06| I'm not throwing darts at anyone, but it's kind of obvious to me that we're throwing numbers all around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| that nobody knows what's happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| And we kind of can't get an answer on really what is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| The one thing that I do know is that if we have a defined contribution plan where we know we're going to put in so much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6021)|
| 1:40:30| and the employee is going to put in so much money, we know what that's going to be each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| because we don't know what's going to happen in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| And we have experts sitting out here who are throwing all these numbers around that I'm not sure what they mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| You know, I'm definitely not an expert in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| But I do know that it seems to me that the hybrid plan is kind of, and I'm going to use this word, and I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| Dr. Lyons, I don't mean it the way it's going to sound, but to me it sounds like a cover-up of the original plan that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6055)|
| 1:41:03| And by a cover-up, what I mean is that we're going to get ourselves in the same situation in a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| as we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Whereas if we go with a defined contribution plan where we can say we're going to put in so much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| the employee is going to put in so much money, and then if we want to add to whatever, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| But if we lock ourselves into even something like this now, you know, what's it really going to cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| I mean, I look at all these charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| I don't know the latest chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| How much is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| All I know is for sure that we're going to be putting $24.5 million into the pension plan this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6095)|
| 1:41:44| We're taking $10 million out of reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| We're putting in an additional $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| I believe these numbers are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| I'm throwing numbers around now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| And I'm thinking to myself, now, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| We're going to be taking this money, and each year we're going to be adding more to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| because next year it's going to be more than $12.5 million, according to charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| And I'm looking at I'm driving on roads that have potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| I'm walking down streets that don't have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| I'm definitely not going to get to trees this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| We're supposed to be a green city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| I'm looking at the employees that we have, and, you know, and that's the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| We're not the bad guys sitting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| What we're trying to do is we're trying to come up with a solution to a real serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| Now, one of the things we've already said, I think, we've agreed that we're going to take care of all our existing employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6153)|
| 1:42:41| those that are vested and not vested, and those new employees coming in at a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| That in itself, I think, is a huge obligation and a huge commitment that we have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| I think that what we're trying to do is we know we have that problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| and we're bleeding pretty heavily over here on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| Now what we're trying to do is to come up with a plan that is going to deal with new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| And we can sit up here and all of us can say, yeah, we're not going to be able to hire people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| and people aren't going to come and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| We don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| We actually do not know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| I've talked to some other cities that are hiring people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| and talked to some other cities that are dealing with the same kind of problem that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| So, you know, we could sit here for the next I don't know how many meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| and, again, with all these numbers and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| But the bottom line is we've got a commitment this year of coming up with the $25 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| that we're having to pay to the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| We're going to have to pay a bunch of money next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| and we know that this has gone out according to all these charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| And so it seems to me that what we ought to do from the taxpayer standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| and those folks that have talked to me is, number one, keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| Come up with a defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| That is fair to both the employee and to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| And then look to the future and not put something like this hybrid plan, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| on my children that live here in Knoxville and pay taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| and my grandchildren that are going to be living here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| and have them deal with a situation in 20 years that we're dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| So, you know, again, I think we ought to keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| And, again, we're hearing all these numbers about what if this and what if that and what if this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| and I don't know in terms of the what ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| And so I just think that we need to look at something very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| I think the New Sentinel article, I think they hit a lot of good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| And so I think if there's some way that we can develop a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| that's the one that I would certainly want to look at pretty seriously on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| Thank you, Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Well, I, Vice Mayor, I've been sitting and listening to our workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| and I am very sensitive to pensions because I draw a civil service pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6291)|
| 1:45:00| And I worked for two years, two years in the military, eight years at the VA hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| and the rest of that time for the United States Postal Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| So I'm very sensitive to pensions and people who draw pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6311)|
| 1:45:17| I'm hopeful that when we get to a point where we actually vote upon something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| we'll have a balance, something where the taxpayers will not go deeply in the hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6323)|
| 1:45:33| and we'll not have to lay off employees and cut back services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| I don't think we're ahead of the game here in this city by the fact that we're doing what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6339)|
| 1:45:47| I don't think we're at an emergency situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| We've had a task force that said it's unsustainable, but at least we are discussing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| So, therefore, we are somewhat ahead of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| But I just wanted to make that statement that I, myself, am very sensitive to pension issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6359)|
| 1:46:07| And I think I'm leaning right now towards the mayor's plan and the hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6367)|
| 1:46:15| something that I think would be good and would be good for the new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6375)|
| 1:46:21| So I just wanted to make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| Well, I think kind of back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| There's no plan here today that we're going to come up with that's just going to solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| our problem for the next 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| So, I mean, we can define contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| It doesn't get us any closer to solving our problems for the next 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| The hybrid plan doesn't get us any closer to solving our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| I mean, that issue is off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| And all that is a mute point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| We've said we're going to close the existing plan and we're going to come up with something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| I think you've got to find something that is sustainable and that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| There is some risk the city ought to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| And that, I'm willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| But you've got to leave some of the controls with that right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| The biggest problem that our plan got us into now is that the controls are all inside the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6433)|
| 1:47:19| And you can't control any of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| You couldn't stop COLA if you wanted to, unless you go to referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| And I think that that's the really important aspect of any of these, of my plan or their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6445)|
| 1:47:31| Any of the plans, as my plan says, you can control those costs right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| And we can decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| And it all must be related back to the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| What my company does for contributions is it's based on profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| If I have profit, we put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| If we don't, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| And that's what I'm saying here is that if we had the money and the budget, then you'd give them a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| If you don't, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| You control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| There's some defined benefit in what they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| But then there's also the responsibility is to be put on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| My suggestion is, is you pull that blue line down and not contribute more than what they contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| If they put in six percent, we put in six percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| You don't contribute 120%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| I mean, you match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| You've heard, you know, I think you match what they put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| And they can put in more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| They don't have to put in six percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| You can write it and they can put in as much as they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| But I think that's how you control the, you know, lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| This blue line is you limit how much you're going to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| I think you match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| And I think there ought to be some differentiations between your fire and police and your general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6514)|
| 1:48:41| And they deserve a lower retirement age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| Sixty-five is not an unreasonable retirement age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| I plan on working to the way past 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| I mean, I'm going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| But that's, you know, but that's always arguable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| But that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| Councilman Campin, were you wanting to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| Let me go to Mr. Pennington first and then I'll come back to this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| I just want to first of all say thank you for the opportunity to address the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| And thank you for the opportunity to work with the city on its pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| I've been privileged to have been associated with the plan in one way or another for about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| And it's been a real honor to work with the folks over here in the different administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| And most recently with Mr. Cherry and Mr. Gilbert and with several of the employees for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| I'd respectfully ask the city employees, if I say something you like, to hold your applause to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| I think the council pretty well knows what your thoughts are on this at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| But my job is not to be an advocate for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| My job is not to be an advocate for the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| And it's not to be an advocate for the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| It's simply to look at the numbers, to run the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| to show you how different assumptions run out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| And at times, you know, maybe to suggest an opinion based on my experience or based on reading I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6596)|
| 1:50:03| Over the last couple of weeks, I have reviewed probably a dozen studies that I've done for different state plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| Colorado, Minnesota, and I've got copies of those if anybody wants to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| Gabriel, Ryder, Smith, Millman, whatever, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| I agree 100 percent with what Mr. Greaves said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| If you put a defined contribution plan in, you know how much your contribution is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6619)|
| 1:50:24| There's no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| It's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| And it's also very clear that nobody wants to get back into the situation that we're now in with an unpredictable, huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6627)|
| 1:50:34| enormous contribution, you know, facing the city that, you know, as Councilman Della Volpe has said to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| well, how are we going to pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| But the question then becomes, is the problem the defined benefit plan or is the problem something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6645)|
| 1:50:53| And, you know, from where I'm standing today, what I will submit to you is that if the retiree liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6653)|
| 1:51:02| the people that were inactive in the defined benefit plan, if those benefits had been fully funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| and they had stayed fully funded either by immunizing or purchasing, you know, fixed income or, you know, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6667)|
| 1:51:14| yes, that would have been relatively more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| But then you would have had maybe $150 million of assets exposed, not $550 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6677)|
| 1:51:24| So what I'm saying is I think there's a way to have a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| I'm right now speaking with the investment committee and the board about some de-risking options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| about how to do that exact thing with the current plan, whether or not you go with a hybrid or whether you go with a DC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6693)|
| 1:51:41| You know, I think de-risking is going to become a part of whatever defined benefit plan is in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6701)|
| 1:51:48| And I applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| The one thing that concerns me greatly, if a defined contribution plan was my only plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| I could say a lot of things about defined contribution, investment return expenses, turnover rates, loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| you know, not being used for retirement because of all these different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| But the number one reason that I would suggest a defined benefit plan is superior to defined contribution is what's called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6727)|
| 1:52:15| mortality risk sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| And what that means is if you've got, let's say, 500 people that retire and they all have $600,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6738)|
| 1:52:25| and that's expected to last their average lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| So let's say they're 62, and on average they're expected to live to age 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| In a defined contribution plan, on average, everybody's going to have enough money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| But in reality, half those people aren't going to have enough money because they're going to outlive those assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| And half those people are going to have more money than they need because they're going to die sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| So, and because in a defined contribution plan you're giving people $500,000 who probably never had more than $5,000 in their bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6769)|
| 1:52:58| account their whole lives and say, here, manage this, a lot of people aren't going to do a good job managing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| So rather than half the people having enough money, maybe you have 25% of the people that really have a meaningful retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6783)|
| 1:53:10| When you accumulate the same amount of assets that if you had in a defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| all of those people would have a guaranteed lifetime benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| And that's not to say that there's not some changes that I think are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| I think the things you are thinking about, I've been working with Dr. Lyons and with the mayor to try to come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6801)|
| 1:53:28| that has less risk for the city by, you know, having this hybrid type plan, which I think is a fabulous idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6808)|
| 1:53:35| I think investing the assets more conservatively so you have less volatility is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| A defined contribution plan can be a good retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| That's my retirement plan with my employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| I don't work for the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| I work for a private employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| We don't have an open defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| And because of the rules that apply to the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| defined benefit plans are very difficult to maintain in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| Same rules don't apply in the government sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| That's a whole different discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| But in any event, I applaud the mayor and the administration for the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| I think the hybrid makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| But I think no matter what you do, you're going to give a good retirement plan to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| And I'm just, you know, like I said, privileged to work with you guys and work with the city and everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6854)|
| 1:54:21| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| Alan, thank you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| You are the one who brought the de-risking idea to the pension board, I believe, in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| And, of course, I have read about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| And that's part of where I've gotten some of the figures that we talked about the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| And I also wanted to thank the mayor and the staff, the mayor's staff, for putting all of this on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| I knew this discussion was going to be a tough discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| But I will also parrot what all those who spoke, the citizens who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6890)|
| 1:54:57| We do have very good employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| And I don't, I believe firmly that if we put a defined contribution plan in place, that would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| We are a very desirable place to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| As Vicky has indicated, we have about a 2% turnover, as I believe you said last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| With that, for the next couple of years, we can anticipate maybe hiring 60 or 80 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6916)|
| 1:55:23| We're a very stable place to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| And I think we have already taken off the table the people who work with us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6925)|
| 1:55:32| We're going to protect them and make sure that they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| It's just going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| Now, at some point, we've got to address, and this is not the discussion right now, how are we going to pay for the liability that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6936)|
| 1:55:45| So that's a discussion for another day, but we will certainly have to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| Thank you, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| And, again, I'd reiterate a lot of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| We have fantastic employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| And I think that's important to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| We're not talking about our current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| So we talk about retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| Nothing we do here should affect the retention of the employees we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| But I've heard a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| One is I've heard that, you know, we're going off a cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| No one's done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| This is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| Johnson City, in 2010, went to a defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| They have a 5% mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| The city does 5%, and it matches up to 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| Kingsport recently changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| They do a 5% mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| The city does a 5%, and they also match up to 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| That's going into place June 30, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| Murfreesboro, population over 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| In July of 2010, they switched to a defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| They put in 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| The city does 3%, and they match up to 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| This is Murfreesboro, not the same size as Knoxville, but let's face it, they're very close to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7017)|
| 1:57:04| So they did that knowing that those employees could move to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7024)|
| 1:57:11| So to say that there's no other cities that have done this, that we're jumping off a cliff, I think that's inaccurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7031)|
| 1:57:18| and that we're being provided misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| In terms of retention and recruitment, I fully understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| This is a tool that helps with retention and recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| I do not deny that, but it comes at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| And the problem for me is we don't know what that cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| It's a black box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| It may be low if the market does well, and it may be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| But do we want a cost that's hooked to the stock market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| And I'd certainly agree with Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| If we make a change to a defined contribution plan, I think we certainly have to look at salaries for those new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7070)|
| 1:57:58| And sort of what's been frustrating is we've been --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| Everything's been compared to the administration's defined contribution plan, which looks very different from these three plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7082)|
| 1:58:09| and looks extremely different from the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| Think about the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| They use benefits to recruit and retain as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| And if you look at the private sector, most of them hover around 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| Now, those employers, they know they could put more in there, but they know that the primary driver for retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7101)|
| 1:58:29| and recruitment is salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| So they put those dollars in the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| And so to be talking about 8% and 10%, a defined contribution plan is not --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7113)|
| 1:58:40| It's limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| And looking at graphs, comparing that, you know, I think salaries would be a big part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| and that's a conversation we would have at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| The other thing you can do with a defined contribution is you have vesting schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| So the city's contribution into the plan, the employee does not have rights to that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7136)|
| 1:59:03| until after a certain number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| So if it costs a lot of money to train an employee, well, if they leave, you know, less than five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7145)|
| 1:59:10| then the city would get that money back that it's put into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| You know, right now, the numbers I got were paying 24% of payroll for fire and police pension benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7155)|
| 1:59:22| and 13% to 15% for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| And we've got this retention and recruitment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| I think that's a very, very expensive retention and recruitment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| I think we could --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| With that 24%, you could do a lot of different things and probably recruit and retain more employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7178)|
| 1:59:45| You know, the hybrid plans, like I said last time, it feels like a nice compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| but really what it is is a new defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| It puts the taxpayers at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| And according to the documents provided by the administration, we heard a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7195)|
| 2:00:02| They said it's a big step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| Seventy percent, 70% of the risk is on the city, is on the backs of the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7205)|
| 2:00:11| the vast majority of whom either have a 401K or have no retirement plan at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7211)|
| 2:00:18| Go around the city, talk to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| A lot of people have no retirement plan at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| So I think that should be taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7223)|
| 2:00:30| Think about the worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| That's sort of what I like to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| In the worst case scenario with a defined contribution plan, we have problems with retention and recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7234)|
| 2:00:42| We can fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| We can fix it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| We can adjust salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| We can provide other benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| We can do things that we know how much they cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| The worst case scenario for a defined contribution plan, well, we are living it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| We're experiencing right now with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| And if you want a short-term example, you don't have to look far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7261)|
| 2:01:06| Look at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| They adopted a plan, I think it was in 2006 or 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| Look where they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| If you adopt a hybrid plan, we could be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7277)|
| 2:01:18| I hope the market does well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| But we could be back here fixing a broken plan very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7279)|
| 2:01:24| And we've already had these discussions about Blackwell and current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| Know that once you adopt a defined benefit plan, you're locking employees in for their tenure and for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7288)|
| 2:01:35| It is a debt that lasts for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| A defined contribution plan is paid every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| You're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| You know how much you have, and you've paid it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| So think about those two worst case scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| And, again, if the market does well on a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| the employees are going to have the benefit of that upswing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| So in either scenario, if the market does well, you know, really, that everyone benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7319)|
| 2:02:08| So think about the experience this community has had with these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7328)|
| 2:02:14| We've got a broken plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| It seems like everyone here is in agreement that our plan is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| I think everyone's in agreement that the county's plan is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| We really want to ask the community to accept another defined benefit plan, given their experience that we've gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7346)|
| 2:02:36| And I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| And to me, it's just that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| We've got a big unfunded liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| We're going to be putting in $10 million of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| The projections are $20 million to $30 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| We're looking probably at tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| We go to the taxpayers for tax increases to pay for pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| I, for one, want to be able to say we solved the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| I don't want to be able to say I'm not going to feel good about saying we solved the problem 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7383)|
| 2:03:09| I want to be able to say we solved the problem 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| The plan we put in today will never do this to the city again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| And you can't say that with a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| These charts and graphs, there are so many assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| You assume how much someone is going to make in their employment, how long they're going to work for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| how long they're going to live, how long their beneficiaries are going to live, what the stock market is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7409)|
| 2:03:36| I mean, just think about all those assumptions and just think about how wrong they all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7416)|
| 2:03:43| That's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| That's the main thing is to me is that we know this plan is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| I don't think a 30 percent fix is the right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| Sorry, that's an older line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| Here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| I mean, I'm glad to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| I think we're probably to that point to where we think that would be a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| Do you want to put that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7454)|
| 2:04:23| I think each of us can express our positions in terms of where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7463)|
| 2:04:28| so that not only we as a group know where we're going, but also the administration will know what the direction is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7468)|
| 2:04:35| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| So, well, I mean, I think that the obvious question to me is a hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| whatever that plan ends up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| I mean, we have lots of them as opposed to the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7485)|
| 2:04:50| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| Yes, and then we have another meeting scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| Yes, sir, next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| Next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| Yes, at some point we need to come down somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| I'm sure that we give the administration time to prepare whatever so we can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| I think we're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| I think we're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| So, I mean, is that a fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| Councilman Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| Is it a fair what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| Well, is that a fair assumption that we would take a straw poll based on a hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7515)|
| 2:05:22| whatever that plan may be, as opposed to a defined contribution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| Well, I mean, I think both of those still offer question marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| I mean, whether the hybrid plan has this, this, or this, or the defined contribution plan has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7532)|
| 2:05:37| I'm on the fence still as far as what's the best route to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| So we can do a straw poll, but, you know, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| That's what you have to say is you're on the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| You can always pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| I think I just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| I just want to make sure that you all feel that that's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| What is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Is it are you in favor of a defined contribution plan or are you in favor of a hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| regardless of its makeup, which was going to be tweaked in later events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| I mean, it's an informal poll, but I think it helps us work the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| I mean, we've.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| I mean, we can't just keep, you know, meeting, meeting, meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| Councilman Walms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| I'm in favor of a hybrid plan, but I'm not in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| I mean, I would vote against a hybrid plan if the really key essentials is how much control we can maintain right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7583)|
| 2:06:30| If you vote for a hybrid plan, if you put a hybrid plan out there that gives all the control back to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| I'll vote against it in favor of a defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| No question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| I mean, there's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| I mean, it's 70 percent risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| I think some of the qualifiers we can put on it can lower that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| I think 70 is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| But we can put in it to where it, you know, define.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| We can decide what we are comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| He's comfortable with zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7617)|
| 2:06:58| I'm comfortable with probably 50 percent risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| So, I mean, if we can do that, yes, I'm in favor of a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7621)|
| 2:07:05| There's still a lot of details to work out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| Well, and that's my whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| It's a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| To me, maybe it's too simple, but the defined contribution is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| I mean, I don't know that there's you can mess with some percentages there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| But I don't think there's as many moving parts, if you will, obviously, to that as opposed to what you presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| Well, they've got, you know, how much the city is going to match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| But there's still less, a lot less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| There is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7653)|
| 2:07:34| I will say this, since you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| Since my light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| I forgot what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| But the fine contribution, it still has some risk in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| I mean, you know what you're going to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7675)|
| 2:07:56| But you're going to put employees across the table or in the same car together that are on different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| So we're going to come for the mayor's going to come back one year and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| I'm going to give a raise to our employees 3 percent across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| It's like, well, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| We've got these people over here on defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| So we're going to give them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| And I think you create these levels when your forces, you only have 1,500 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7693)|
| 2:08:19| It's not that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| In terms of private sector, it's not that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| I mean, I don't think you want the management of that is the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| And you can say we don't know what the recruiting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| And I agree that that is an intangible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| And it's also an intangible what it does to your forces and how you manage through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| and how you're asking the management team, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| to manage different employees sitting at the same table on different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| I think that is very, very difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| And it's very difficult to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| So that's an unintended consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| Not as it reaches the taxpayer, it reaches the taxpayer in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| It reaches the taxpayer in job performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| So you've got to be really careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| You don't have that in your own businesses where you have a bunch of different plans for different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| that are doing the same job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| So I think that's something you've got to be careful about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| And I think Councilwoman Palmer brought that point very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| If you want to do the defined contribution, then you've got to look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| you've got somebody that is a captain in the fire department that's somebody, a new hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| that could be just about equal to a captain's pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| You know, so, I mean, it is a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| It is hard to manage, but that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| So we've got a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| We've got a contingency on a lot of you favor a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7770)|
| 2:09:37| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| I favor a hybrid, but, you know, with some controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| If we have our ---- I just want to get clarity on our straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| That is a non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| That can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| There's nothing to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| But I want to ask you, we will be having another workshop next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| Do you anticipate or do we anticipate any more workshops after next Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7797)|
| 2:10:05| Let me just throw that out for discussion while we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| I think everything we're doing right now is based on uncharted waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7809)|
| 2:10:17| I mean, I would hope that we would be able to perhaps conclude next Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| but I still don't think that we're completely there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| I think we're getting there, but it's getting closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| We do have ---- if we get something on the ballot by November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| then we would need to conclude the workshops by when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| June 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| June 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| We've got to have it to the pension board by June 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7841)|
| 2:10:46| Someone said the 12th is when they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| Yes, but we can deliver it by the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| The city attorney, Mr. Gilbert, just reminded me that one other consideration you might want to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7854)|
| 2:11:00| in this decision is to the extent you did decide to put everybody in a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| then you might want to look at having some sort of disability coverage in addition to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| that's currently provided in the DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| It's more than just a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| It has a disability component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7875)|
| 2:11:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| Someone gets hurt on the job and cannot work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| Oh, I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| Oh, are we doing our straw poll now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| Oh, well, yes, I'm in favor of the hybrid plan that the mayor has put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7893)|
| 2:11:34| I'm in favor of the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| I'm open to what Councilman Wallace has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| I'm certainly very supportive of what the mayor's office has presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| and I think that this group has shown a great deal of sensibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7903)|
| 2:11:48| and we all have some very similar concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| We're just taking different paths to get to the end zone, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| And I'll ditto that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| That's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| Councilman DelBocchi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| Well, I'm listening to my colleagues, and I'm trying to get my head straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| I swing back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| Now you know how we feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| I swing back and forth because I think the idea of 70% risk on the taxpayer sounds way too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7929)|
| 2:12:16| and I hear Mr. Wallace saying, well, we can manage that by coming up with a hybrid with less risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7936)|
| 2:12:22| and that has some appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| The idea of a defined contribution with a known amount that you put on the table every year has some appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7944)|
| 2:12:32| but I am concerned about low-income folks maybe not having enough to retire on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7952)|
| 2:12:37| That troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| That steers me halfway towards a hybrid, but I really do like the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7958)|
| 2:12:44| I would say most people in the country, that's all they really have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| And people who call me say, look, I'm working today because the assets I accrued aren't as big as they wanted them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7969)|
| 2:12:59| And 2008 was a disaster in everyone's book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| Unless you're Houdini, you lost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| You probably lost money in 2001, 2002, because the market, when the market goes down, the boats all go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7984)|
| 2:13:11| When it goes up, the boats kind of float.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| And your vote is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| I will go with a defined contribution unless we come up with a hybrid of 50% risk or, you know, less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=7998)|
| 2:13:26| Something that cuts the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| Yes, I'm in favor of a defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| So, at the next meeting, what will be the council's pleasure to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| Why don't you give them Mark Campin's e-mail address and that will solve this whole problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| That's not funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| I think, Mayor, I think that when we talk about a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| I think that maybe what maybe the administration, I realize they've come to us with a hybrid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8038)|
| 2:14:04| but maybe they can take into consideration that some of us are concerned about their hybrid plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| and that they could come to us with some kind of a makeup of a defined contribution plan that does take into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8048)|
| 2:14:15| you know, the disability and things like this that you talked about that we would certainly want our employees to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| And, again, I think that as my colleagues have said, you know, we are taking care of the existing employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8061)|
| 2:14:29| and those that are coming in by a certain date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| And what we're looking for is to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| And then, George, I think also we still have not solved the major bleeding problem that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| It's something that we have to, that's a whole separate issue that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| But I move we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| Well, we've got to figure out what we're doing next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| Oh, I thought we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8089)|
| 2:14:49| You've got public forum left to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| So what are we going to do Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| That was your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Yeah, that's the real question on the table now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| Well, I mean, we've still got a lot of moving parts there that I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| I guess we can have further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Well, that concept of de-risking that Alan mentioned is an important one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| and it fits in with what Mr. Wallace said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| And he makes a great point, I think, about some of the levers in whatever hybrid you come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8112)|
| 2:15:20| ought to be kept as a discretionary matter because if you're in a bad situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8120)|
| 2:15:28| you may not be able to do as much cost of living or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8128)|
| 2:15:32| And that's where the risk really is coming from right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| There are lots of things happening, and we can't afford them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| And we don't want to put the next council and the next council and the next council there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| So they'll get to make decisions based on what the numbers look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| I mean, you've got to be rational about this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| We could ask him to run that line on that plan right there, and then it would, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| I'm hoping that it's going to get down to 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| But let me recognize Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8157)|
| 2:16:01| There's really two ways, I think, that risk is created in the retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| One of the risks has to do directly with how the assets are invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8167)|
| 2:16:13| If the assets are invested relatively more conservatively, then there's less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8173)|
| 2:16:19| If they're invested more aggressively, there's more risk, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| To the extent inactive liability was, let's call it immunized, sort of as if you had purchased annuities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8182)|
| 2:16:32| you know, that kind of takes that risk off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| If that had been done all along, we wouldn't be having this discussion today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| because we wouldn't be in the position that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| The other piece of risk is how is it shared between the city and between the employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8200)|
| 2:16:47| Because right now, on the whole, the city is taking all the risks in the defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| Under the hybrid, there is some sharing of that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| My --" what I wanted to point out is that at least the way the rules are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8215)|
| 2:17:03| it's beyond the purview of the council to dictate how the assets are invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8223)|
| 2:17:08| And yet, one of the key concerns is, if you have a hybrid plan, how is the risk going to be split?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8228)|
| 2:17:17| But how much risk is there going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| So, to the extent you come back and say, well, we could accept a hybrid if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8239)|
| 2:17:26| with respect to the inactive liability, we knew it was going to be handled at least within these broad parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8246)|
| 2:17:33| To limit the total amount of risk, that might do just as much or more as whether you're tweaking the 40,000 to 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8253)|
| 2:17:43| I mean, that changes the risk profile a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| But a lot of the risk is the employees retire from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| They take a lifetime annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| All those retirees now have assets that are in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| So, however you split the risk while they're active, a good amount of that risk is after they retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| And that's not really affected by that 40,000, 20,000, wherever you set that break point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| That's really more dictated by how are those assets going to be invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| Can I follow up on what he just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8292)|
| 2:18:13| Because, actually, Alan's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| That configuration is done by the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| And that's really not under our purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| I think at some point, quite frankly, we need to have a conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| But I think that wouldn't be necessarily productive time for us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| Hey, Councilman Greer, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| I was just going to say that you were asking what to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| Again, I go back to say that let's look at a defined contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| and see what it does look like, the different parts and pieces, and have them put that together, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| You know, is that enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8327)|
| 2:18:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| Is that enough time for you all to be able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| Well, it has the disability component, I guess, and nothing else, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8333)|
| 2:19:00| What additional information are you asking for beyond what you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8340)|
| 2:19:06| Whether or not we can have a plan, an example of a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8346)|
| 2:19:11| You've got the 457, obviously, but you don't have the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| Is there anything that needs to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| The disability part has to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| And whatever else has to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| Is that your estimate of the premiums for disability plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| Well, as I hear it, then, the disability part of it and what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| He's saying the percentages that you would put in the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| In other words, do you match at 6%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| Do you do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8374)|
| 2:19:35| John Sparrow said that you can put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8375)|
| 2:19:36| You have to put a certain amount in, but you can put in more and they'll match up to a higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| I mean, there was all those aspects you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| What numbers would we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| So you just want to cross the board, I mean, like a, I don't know, 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8385)|
| 2:19:51| I've got to give them direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| In the defined contribution plan, if you say we're going to put in 8% and the cost is 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8393)|
| 2:19:57| And it's 8% of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| So, I mean, I can take the projected payroll and apply the payroll to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| But, I mean, what you've got in these projections, or maybe you don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8402)|
| 2:20:07| but these projections that we were just looking at that Dr. Lyons was showing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| the blue line on there is an 8% of payroll defined contribution for the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8412)|
| 2:20:18| city government employees, and a 10% for the fire and police employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| So it averages out around 9% of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| So if that's 9%, it's not, you know, if you're 8%, it goes down, you know, a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| If you're, you know, it's not a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| I mean, it's going to be a sort of interpolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| If you double it, it goes up twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| If you half it, it goes in half or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| But if you had vesting schedules and a match component, does that, that would change it, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8439)|
| 2:20:49| Well, if it was a, are you talking about having voluntary contributions instead of mandatory contributions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| Because, I mean, I'm actually personally in favor of if we had a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| all the risk is on the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8460)|
| 2:21:01| I don't think it should be mandatory that they contribute to a plan that the risk is on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8461)|
| 2:21:06| So I would say there would be no, and, you know, if I had my own way, that there would be no mandatory contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| They, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| I mean, just hypothetically, let's say that there was an 8% up to an 8% match and people could contribute up to 15%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8475)|
| 2:21:22| or whatever, but the city would only contribute up to 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| And then you hypothesize that, on average, 50% of the population would do the entire contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8485)|
| 2:21:33| So now you're looking at a 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| I mean, some people might do 6%, some people might do 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| But let's say it averaged 4% or 5%, then you'd be looking at about half of that blue line that's on this page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8497)|
| 2:21:46| Now, you know, if you either want to give me some directions on the specifics of that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8506)|
| 2:21:53| I can rerun that, but it's pretty much the vesting schedule isn't going to make a big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8513)|
| 2:22:00| big difference in terms of the cost because the employees are getting all their money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| They're not getting the city money for those first five or ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| But, frankly, in the defined contribution projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| I've just been applying 8% and 10% of the payroll and not factoring in the vesting schedule directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8531)|
| 2:22:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| I'm going to cut discussion off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| I mean, we've got to thank you so much, I mean, everybody, for the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| I've been trying to keep these to two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| We've still got some people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| We've got a meeting coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| Let's sleep on it and, you know, think about what you've just got to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| We've got from now until Tuesday for, you know, if there's going to be a major change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| or other ask that we need to be considerate of, you know, time schedules there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8562)|
| 2:22:48| Yeah, if I could say one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| I think we have two things we want to look at Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| One is this idea of how do you control the risk allocation because that matters, I think, to some folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8572)|
| 2:22:58| The other is if there's some flexibility on costing out scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8578)|
| 2:23:03| and I don't know how much time or computer time that takes, whether that can be done somewhat on the fly or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8583)|
| 2:23:11| I don't know if, for example, Allen could have three or four lines with different assumptions on one or two of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8591)|
| 2:23:17| or not just so that we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| But money is going to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| The money is going to matter to this panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| I think Dr. Lyons can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| I would like to provide you with the information you need to make your decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8605)|
| 2:23:29| including variations that you asked about the D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| I mean, so I think if Mr. Pennington said he will make himself available if you want to communicate some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| such as has come up, and I'll let you speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| I was going to say this is a huge, huge decision for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| I love discussions with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| I love talking to Mr. Saunders because we don't agree all the time, which makes it a lot more fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| But if somebody wants to call me up, if you don't have my card, see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| If you don't have my card, this is a massive decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| I'll be happy to share with you my opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| Take them, leave them, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| I've got copies of studies that other groups have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| I'll be happy to share those with you, look at them, see if that helps you clarify your thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8644)|
| 2:24:09| But anything I can do to assist you, I am more than happy to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| And, you know, the cost that we incur in the next week or ten days is not going to be material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8653)|
| 2:24:19| in terms of the overall effort that we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| I'm going to call up Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| It's her time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| And if you will, please be as brief as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8668)|
| 2:24:35| Impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| I've got a button here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| And I'm going to try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| Anita Cash, president of General Employees Association, 160 Bird Road, Lenore City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| And, Vice Mayor Pavlis, I'd like to thank you yet for another opportunity to address you at now our fifth workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8689)|
| 2:24:55| And you will see me next Tuesday at our sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| You're not going to wear us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| None of you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| You may not want to hear what we've got to say, but you won't wear us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| We do want to hear what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| Well, first off, I want to thank the mayor, Mayor O'Hara, and her administration for their commitment to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8706)|
| 2:25:13| for the development and support of the Defined Benefit, Defined Contribution Plus Pension Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8713)|
| 2:25:19| and for the recommendation of the additional $10 million contribution from the Rainy Day Fund in the pension budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8719)|
| 2:25:28| or the budget address she gave at the luncheon last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| Again, we've slowly drifted away due to the late hour, but, as I said, we are still here and we will continue to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8733)|
| 2:25:41| I think it's been said a number of times that you can't impact the employees that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8741)|
| 2:25:46| You can't impact the ones that are vested without a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8746)|
| 2:25:52| You can impact the ones that are here that are not vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| And you've not taken a straw poll on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| So I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8761)|
| 2:26:02| Well, you can still change your mind because you did the straw poll on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| And I hope you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8765)|
| 2:26:06| I have good faith that some of you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8766)|
| 2:26:11| I think each of you received or I was told that you received this information from Pat Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8771)|
| 2:26:17| the employee that compiled all of this or gathered and put this in form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8777)|
| 2:26:22| I just want to call your attention that he looked at the four major cities in Tennessee and Lexington, Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8782)|
| 2:26:30| and Atlanta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| And Memphis has no minimum age for retirement as long as you work there 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8792)|
| 2:26:39| So if you come here as an 18-year-old firefighter or policeman, you can leave when you're 43 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8799)|
| 2:26:45| That's not what the mayor proposed in her hybrid plan for any branch of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8805)|
| 2:26:51| The vesting range is from five to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| And the calculation of benefits ranges from 24 months to 60 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8814)|
| 2:26:58| exactly what we are now with what's proposed in the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| We've heard much said about the rule of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| Well, one of those plans has a rule of 70 for uniformed employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| Employee contributions range from zero in Nashville for all employees to 11 percent in Lexington for uniformed employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8832)|
| 2:27:20| And accrual rate ranges from 1.7 to 3 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| So what does this say about the city of Knoxville pension plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| It says our current pension plan is in line with other major cities in Tennessee, Lexington, Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| and Atlanta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| It says that any changes will have an impact on future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| And I don't care what you say, it will have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| Several workshops ago, you heard Chief Roush and Chief Sharp get up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| and they talked about the fine men and women of the police department and the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| I don't disagree with the thing they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| That's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8874)|
| 2:27:55| We're all good employees, because if we weren't, we'd have gone home a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8875)|
| 2:28:00| For just a second, I'd like to address with you two areas of general government where we're going to see an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8880)|
| 2:28:06| when we change the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| We contacted two local engineering firms here in town to get some salary and benefit information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8889)|
| 2:28:17| And when you compare an entry-level engineer with a BS degree at $50,000 yearly at a private company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8897)|
| 2:28:26| with 100% employee health care paid by the employer and a 4% match on defined contribution, that's for Company 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8906)|
| 2:28:35| Company 2 pays beginning salary $45,000 to $48,000, 100% employee health care paid by the employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8915)|
| 2:28:44| and a 3% minimum match in bad years and more in good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8924)|
| 2:28:49| A City of Knoxville Level 1 engineer with a degree that we refer to as a Civil Engineer 1 has a starting salary of $41,249,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8929)|
| 2:29:00| which varies health care options, none of which are paid 100% by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8940)|
| 2:29:06| At best, our entry-level salary is $3,000 plus less than the two private firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8946)|
| 2:29:13| The benefits paid by the private companies are significantly more than paid by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8953)|
| 2:29:20| We also ask about their Engineers 3 and Engineer 4 comparable to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8960)|
| 2:29:27| Company 1, their beginning salary is $80,000 to $90,000, and Company 2 is $75,000 to $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8967)|
| 2:29:35| The city's $52,148 for a Civil Engineer 3 and an Engineer 4 is $58,960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8975)|
| 2:29:48| Substantial discrepancies between private and public companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| That's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| We hear all about the private industry, all about the private industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| We're not private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| I heard that my entire working career when my husband worked at TDOT and I worked here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9000)|
| 2:30:04| Everybody thought we were rolling in the dough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| We weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9006)|
| 2:30:07| We came for the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| That's why we stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9009)|
| 2:30:10| He'd been there 41 years when he passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| I've been here 32 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9013)|
| 2:30:14| Folks, it is not about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9014)|
| 2:30:17| It's about the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9017)|
| 2:30:20| So the next place we looked was information systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| Our help desk people, many of whom you all have met with already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9024)|
| 2:30:29| City of Knoxville, starting salary, $26,418.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9029)|
| 2:30:36| The median range for that same employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| Ms. Cash, you're going to have to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| Median range for that employee is $32,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| We lag behind current surveys from $24,000 to $30,000 just in a help desk technician's role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9046)|
| 2:30:56| There are even more in the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| I urge you, listen to the citizens who came before you tonight to support city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9058)|
| 2:31:06| They didn't come here telling you what not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| They came here and asked you what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9072)|
| 2:31:17| Frederick Wagner, thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9077)|
| 2:31:26| He was having fun, too, like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| Frederick Wagner, 5904 Loyce Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| I work in the public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| I've been here almost since I graduated from high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| I make $560 every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| And I want you to look around the room in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| When I was sitting listening to some of the conversations, let me first say to Councilman Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9106)|
| 2:31:51| thank you for standing in the gap for us employees out here, because it is not about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9111)|
| 2:31:57| It is about the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| When I was sitting out here listening, a poem came to my mind that was written by Dr. Maya Angelou,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9120)|
| 2:32:06| and it simply says, I come as one, but I stand as 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9126)|
| 2:32:11| Now, we're all united in here tonight because of pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| And I'm glad that you protected the vested employees and the non-vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9135)|
| 2:32:21| But I want you to take into account that the person that's going to come in after me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9141)|
| 2:32:26| that's going to have to weed eat in 90-degree weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| that person that's going to have to run in a burning building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| and save his fellow woman or fellow man from a building, it's not about the money, but it is about our pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9154)|
| 2:32:43| And you've got to take into account we have lives, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9163)|
| 2:32:49| We have hopes, dreams, and aspirations just like anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| You know, when I came here, I signed that dotted line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| There were two things that I knew for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| I wasn't going to make much money, but I would have a decent pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9179)|
| 2:33:04| And when you get out in the rain and have to pick up brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| and have to fix a pothole out in the middle of a street and take the risk of being mowed over by a vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9188)|
| 2:33:14| then you can come and tell me about my plight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| But until that time, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9196)|
| 2:33:18| So you take into consideration all these employees in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9198)|
| 2:33:23| They have all done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| The ones that sit behind the desks, the ones that get out and weed eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9204)|
| 2:33:29| the ones that you don't see at night that I have worked on nights here for overtime to pay for school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9209)|
| 2:33:34| because I go to school part-time, too, that I miss tonight to be here because it is important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| You take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| You walk Neyland Drive or Neyland Stadium or Cumberland or whatever you want to call it four times in one night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9222)|
| 2:33:47| and you see how your feet feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| You take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9230)|
| 2:33:52| It is not about the money, but it's about the people's pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| And the people that are going to come in behind us, you take that into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| because what I'm doing, they're going to have to do that job also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| And I support the mayor for what she's doing, but you take into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9243)|
| 2:34:08| because you're going to affect a generation of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9248)|
| 2:34:11| And I understand that you've got to do budgets and all of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| I understand all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| But you take these people in here into consideration, because nobody knows our jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9256)|
| 2:34:22| You don't know our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9262)|
| 2:34:23| Nobody in here knows it but us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9263)|
| 2:34:26| And when you get out and have to work out in the conditions that we work in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9266)|
| 2:34:30| you might as well work for free for what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| You take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| So, general government does a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| I respect the officers, the firemen, but we're broke down, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9279)|
| 2:34:44| Lifting off three tons of asphalt is not an easy job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| And asphalt is known to cause cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| So, you know, we're out in the line of, you know, we might not have things flying at us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9290)|
| 2:34:55| but we're out in the line of fire in other ways, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9295)|
| 2:34:58| So I commend all the people that sit here tonight, the person that sits behind the desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9298)|
| 2:35:03| the person that takes a call to have to go to a robbery, that person that has to go to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| I commend all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| But take into consideration the person that's going to come in after behind us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| because they're going to do what we had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9315)|
| 2:35:18| It's not the salary, but it's the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| And, you know, there's a person that comes to my church the first Saturday of every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9321)|
| 2:35:25| I'm not going to mention his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| And he's 60 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| And he has to come to our church to just make it to get by with food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9330)|
| 2:35:34| So you take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9334)|
| 2:35:36| And I think for what you all have done, but take into consideration the employees in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| And I think Anita Cash, I think Prudential, I think these people that have stood in the gap for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| But when you go home and lay your head down at night, you think of that person that clears the ice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| and the snow off your road and picks up leaves in 20-degree weather where your fingers are numb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9350)|
| 2:35:56| Just think of that person, because I've done it, and there's some other people in here that have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9356)|
| 2:36:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9361)|
| 2:36:08| Reverend John Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9368)|
| 2:36:17| Your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| It's 804, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| I'm John Butler, 4111 Landon Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9381)|
| 2:36:27| I also pastor Clinton Chapel and Meson Church at 546 College Street, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9387)|
| 2:36:35| I also am presiding over the Knoxville District Tennessee Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9395)|
| 2:36:39| And I'm a member of the Police Advisory Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9399)|
| 2:36:42| And I come to --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| I was asked to come to support the mayor's hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| But quite honestly, after sitting here and hearing your discussion, I am thoroughly confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9409)|
| 2:36:58| And I think, quite honestly, you all haven't quite grasped all of the terminology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9418)|
| 2:37:04| and what's the best way to go and what's the best thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| You know you have something before you you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9428)|
| 2:37:11| I also kind of smiled because when I look at some of you, I remember you coming by Clinton Chapel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9431)|
| 2:37:17| seeing you had other new hope at other places when you're running for election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9437)|
| 2:37:22| And here you are with this tough job, with this tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| We would definitely pray with you that you make the best decision not only for the employees but for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9446)|
| 2:37:34| So I won't even attempt to tell you what to do or how to do it because, quite honestly, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9454)|
| 2:37:42| I have to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| I really wanted to come and say I support the mayor's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| But I'm not familiar with it enough to say that's the best plan for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9465)|
| 2:37:50| But I do think it's important that you do think about those employees who are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9470)|
| 2:37:57| Because as this gentleman has just said, these what you're talking about is not just what is the plight of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9477)|
| 2:38:06| government and what the city responsibilities are, which quite honestly is why you were elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9486)|
| 2:38:13| why I voted for some of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9493)|
| 2:38:16| But also the people who you're looking at, this is the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9496)|
| 2:38:24| These folk are the city, the people who do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| And so I just, I do, from what I do understand, I do support a hybrid plan that does have the perimeters in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9508)|
| 2:38:41| that protects the city as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| I do also, quite honestly, support the defined plan because you know what you're going to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9526)|
| 2:38:53| And as a budget person, I like to know what I'm going to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| So I think that may be why I'm leaning toward the hybrid plan because I believe you can have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9537)|
| 2:39:03| and have those things built in to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| You have to work hard to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9547)|
| 2:39:08| Your job is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| I know how difficult it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| But once again, I echo the remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| Affordable, sustainable, keeping it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| If it's going to be on the ballot, if you put something on the ballot with what we heard tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| I won't know what to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| So it's best possible presented to the citizens in a way that we know what we're going to have to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9565)|
| 2:39:31| But I would support taxes that are going to take care of the employees from the fire, police, and general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9571)|
| 2:39:43| I support the plan that's been presented by the mayor because people that I trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9583)|
| 2:39:48| and I know support the plan, people that I've worked with over the last two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9588)|
| 2:39:53| police officers who come to the church for the community, neighborhood watch program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120503?start=9593)|
