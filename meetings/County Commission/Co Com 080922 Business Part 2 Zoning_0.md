| 0:01:07| Well, we've got to take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=67)|

| 0:01:20| Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| Would it be appropriate, or maybe even John Troy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| would it be appropriate if we could have in the language that the money be designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| for a possible intake center, would it be best to put that as part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=93)|
| 0:01:40| or maybe when the proposals come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| Because I think if we could designate those funds for an intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| that wasn't a little question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Well, no, I mean, would it be appropriate here or when they come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| When they come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=115)|

| 0:02:13| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=133)|

| 0:44:11| Looking at the map on this one, this is a very, looks like there's a significant amount of slope in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| And I'm just curious how you intend to deal with the slope issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| I mean, it looks like there's some areas here in excess of 25% in the center of the property and some others inner or near that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2662)|
| 0:44:31| How are you going to handle those issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| Well, pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2674)|

| 0:44:55| The only usable land is about the first three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| I have a concept drawn up that has condos to match those that are presently in front of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2702)|
| 0:45:10| I am considering redoing that into single-family homes, small single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2710)|

| 0:46:44| Bud, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| I'll take this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| This is a request by the applicant to rezone two areas that currently have the same zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2809)|
| 0:46:58| Both are zoned at Planned Residential at up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| The request would effectively combine those two districts into a single district with the same density classification of Planned Residential at up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2823)|
| 0:47:16| One of the current districts is 22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| The other current district is seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| The 22-acre district fronts on John's Fair Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| The seven-acre district fronts on Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| The net effect of this request would be to remove the line between those two districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| and create a single district for a unified development at five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2858)|
| 0:47:47| Okay, are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| That's not the whole story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| Number one, we're getting a new word in here, district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| I don't remember anything being in districts before, and I served a term on the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2884)|
| 0:48:13| He also didn't mention the fact that these two properties are not owned by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| He owns the big piece, but he doesn't own the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| So what we're doing, we're transferring development rights from one section or zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| or whatever he wants to call it here onto another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| And we don't have any plan, ordinance, or whatever that deals with transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2913)|
| 0:48:42| I'm going to give each party five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Mr. Jernigan, you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| I'll just make my name is Victor Jernigan, 1-0-8, Stequoia Lane, S-T-E-K-O-I-A, Suite 103, Knoxville, 3-7-9-1-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2930)|
| 0:49:01| And just as a short comment, and then I'll yield the floor to Mr. Ballard, this is not a transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2941)|
| 0:49:09| It is a subdivision, which will have a subdivision plat, which is permitted every single week in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2949)|
| 0:49:17| It is a subdivision. There is no transfer of density rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| Mr. Ballard can speak now to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| All right, I'll pass this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| I have other copies on my desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| It's quick and dirty, so you can get something from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| My name is Scott Ballard, 7744 Trophy Run Lane, here representing the South Dole Area homeowners today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| many of whom are here as well as other concerned citizens in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| First of all, I want to get rid of some diversions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| This issue has been going around in circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| This is not about urban sprawl or smart growth development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| Those are good concepts, but that's not what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| This is not about providing housing or low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| We're unaware of any housing shortages in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| It's not about developing three lanes with a turn lane on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| This would have happened thanks to TDOT and the taxpayers of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| regardless of whether Wells Creek Development did anything here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| It's not about stormwater or low-impact development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| Knox County Stormwater Ordinance takes care of those issues and requires that of all developers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| It's not about luxury apartments or the big house concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| We trust that this developer, I think that's their preference, which is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| but we think the condominiums that were originally proposed were more than acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| It's not about the quality or the product of what Wells Creek Development will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| We trust that they will do a good job, whatever they do, that will be acceptable to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| And it's certainly not about Fanzlers, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| I'm not an old lawyer, but in the Knox County MPC rules and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3069)|
| 0:51:17| it's very clear that any zoning must be approved by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| That is you. That is not MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| So that being said, the big point here I want to point out, and it was already brought up by Wells Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3088)|
| 0:51:37| and they're right, this is not about transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| Now, you all heard me here last month's meeting pointing out the issues with transfer of development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| and we kind of got off on that track because at our August meeting of the South Delaware homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| the terminology that the, well, transfer, not transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| but development rights moved from one location to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| and transfer of density was the terminology we used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| So we kind of picked up on that, and that's where we got into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| But as Commissioner Brown pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| Knox County does not have any provisions whatsoever for the implementation of transfer development rights concepts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3133)|
| 0:52:21| which is a method of conservation easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| So you don't want to clarify those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| There's no policies, procedures, or anything with regard to transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| What this is about is we want to use the facts and, you know, get into the issue of what's really going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3153)|
| 0:52:44| It's very clear for those of you that are new on the commission, I'll hit the high points real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| About a year and a half ago, Wells Creek made application for their 17 acres to put condominiums on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3170)|
| 0:52:58| We were aware of that as South Delaware homeowners in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| We did not oppose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| We met the south sector plan, and it met the density and zoning requirements that were established by that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3183)|
| 0:53:10| So there was no reason we trusted that the Wells Creek development would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3190)|
| 0:53:18| Later they came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| They applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| They gained additional properties that came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| It basically proposed up to 12 dwelling units per acre, asked for an amendment to the south sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| That was approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| We opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| It came before this body, and it was denied, and rightfully so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| because it did not follow the sector plan in any form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| So since that time, they have gone in and talked to adjacent property owners that were not a party to this development at all in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3222)|
| 0:53:53| They had no hearsay or no say in the matter whatsoever, to the best of our knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| So what we think is happening here is because they were unable to get from the five dwelling units per acre up to the 12 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3240)|
| 0:54:10| they've came up with another way to come in from the backside, in our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| and that was to go to these people and say, can I have your development rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| Can I have your development rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| So just to summarize here, in our opinion, we think this is not following any process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| or procedures that are established for zoning in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| We leave you with the question, how is this being done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| How is a developer being able to take the development rights or density rights from another piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3278)|
| 0:54:51| whether it be contiguous, whether it be across the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| That's a big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| That's one of our concerns, to increase the density on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| They did not purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| One last point I'd like to make is we've heard it from MPC staff that this is done all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| Well, I beg to differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| I do understand how a subdivision works, and this is a perfect example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| They purchased this property from the Wells family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| The Wells family was allowed to leave their home in the original plan now, not the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| because the current plan, I think, has turned their home into a country club or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| or the clubhouse for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| But in the original plan, they bought it, and that home was to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| And it's right in the heart of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| You can see it on your plats there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| That's what goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| That's where they're allowed, typically, to maintain their rights as a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| So this is totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| This is coming in after the fact and just asking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| We have a lot of concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| We have a lot of concerns of what's going to happen with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| You all heard a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Most of you that are on the commission today heard that last month when we discussed transfer development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| So that's basically what I've got to summarize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| I'll be glad to take any questions if anybody has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Maybe you want to stay up there just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| I've tried to follow this as best I can because it's obviously a very complex situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| But is the opposition that you have to this, the subdivision in general with the plan of the subdivision or parts of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3387)|
| 0:56:36| or is the opposition just the fact that this sets a precedent for the transfer of development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| and you're concerned that that will be exercised elsewhere without the proper hearings or policy for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3401)|
| 0:56:49| I guess what I'm asking, are you against this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| or are you against the way the project developed with this issue of the transfer of development rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| I'll answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Let me clarify first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Like I said earlier, this is not about transfer of development rights because we have no procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| as has been pointed out many times both by the applicant and by MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3425)|
| 0:57:13| That being said, whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| our opposition is we object to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| It concerns us for the future, not just this development but for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| But in this development in particular because he was approved for five dwelling units per acre within the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3446)|
| 0:57:35| was then denied 12 dwelling units per acre in accordance with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| and is now getting a greater density than five dwelling units per acre on his property merely by claiming development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3460)|
| 0:57:50| whatever form or fashion it takes, that, you know, that's where our issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| And there is no process, procedures, zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| or anything that establishes how that is to take care or how that is to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| So what you're really you object to is the way the process developed more than the actual final product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3487)|
| 0:58:16| It was the process of how it got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| We don't think that's a legitimate process, and we think that the developer is kind of bending the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3499)|
| 0:58:27| Mr. Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| You tell me if I'm understanding you correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| You don't mind that this property that's being bought in this development right, if they built these units on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| If they built five dwelling units per acre, which is basically the condominiums they originally proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3522)|
| 0:58:49| But I'm talking about the property they're bringing in to the-that they're buying the development rights from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| What you're opposed to is putting more units on property that's owned by one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| by taking the rights from another piece of property and putting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| But, now, if he had bought this property, you're saying you would not oppose it if he put five on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| If he had bought this property from all these individuals and applied for the five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| he could build the number of units he's proposing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| But he would have followed the process of our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| And we would have, as a community, we would have protection in that his ownership of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| those properties are covered by deed, by restrictions, whatever they set up for that subdivision or that, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3574)|
| 0:59:43| the terminology we're using now is the zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| The zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| It would be the one zoning district with all those restrictions and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| We're concerned that the willy-nilly, make another district and then plug them all together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| regardless of ownership, opens the door for some major issues for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Commissioner Henders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| What do you own currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Do you own, I'm looking on the KGIS map, 31?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| I don't actually have one of the plots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| If you look at the larger map that's got the layout of the 144 homes, the 130 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| you'll see sort of not that one but the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| This one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| This one outlines basically what we currently own or have contracted to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3641)|
| 1:00:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| And so the question that you were asking is basically 2305 through 27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| which adjoin Tipton Station Road on the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| which are currently owned by other people who are going to join our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| So right now they're not in a subdivision, and they are voluntarily choosing to join our subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| and there will be a subdivision plat that will be recorded on all of the properties, theirs included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| So while Mr. Ballard and some other people want to continue to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| and use transfer development rights, it is a subdivision, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| It is similar to a situation that if I had just simply bought all the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| and had platted those individual lots on Tipton Station Road as large lots in that subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| it's exactly the same net effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| Let's go with number 24 there on Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| It's got a large house, a couple of three buildings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| Yes, it's one building, one house and a swimming pool building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Five years from now they want to put a condo unit in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| Does that belong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| Would they be able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Would they be able to change that zoning on that property because you put it in your subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| All the properties that face Tipton Station Road all have a limit as to how much they can expand the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| because when we file the subdivision plat, MPC will keep track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| Right now, the entire track of ground is permitted for approximately 145 housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| And when we plat our property, there will be a count as to how many housing units are going to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| So the lady who owns 24, she also owns 26 and 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3761)|
| 1:02:49| And she would have the right, if she so chose, to put two, she has a little over three acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| so she would have the right to put two more homes on that property if she so chose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| But she can't do more than two more homes on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| And the reason that it's a subdivision, it goes directly to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| Right now, all those properties along Tipton Station are approved for up to five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| She, for example, could apply tomorrow and put 15, I think it's 16 dwelling units on her property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3797)|
| 1:03:26| in different configurations of different architectural style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| I mean, it's a pretty wide range of things that she could build on her property today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| By joining our subdivision, she's going to agree to certain architectural restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| There's a limit as to how many more units she can build coming out on to Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| We have the irrevocable, I or whoever owns the remaining property in Willis Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| homeowners association, whomever, will have the irrevocable right of refusal, first refusal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| if she ever decides to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| So it's a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| It's like Gulf Park, Forest Brook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| It's like any of the great subdivisions around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3844)|
| 1:04:11| So you currently own plot number 31, 2201, 2203, and 2202?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3851)|
| 1:04:19| Thirty-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| We own 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| We have the right to purchase 3101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| We have the right to purchase 2201, 2203, and 2202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| So all you own currently is 31?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| And that was what was approved by MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| That was approved by MPC for five units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| And it was then subsequently approved by MPC for 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| But denied by commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| But denied by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Commissioner Luthell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| You know, Commissioner Anders brings up a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| Let's say five years down the road this lady here decides that she wants to build more than two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3899)|
| 1:05:08| Could she come before the commission at that time and ask for that to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| And commission at that time could override this two additional units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| We have an opinion from the law director on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| And the law director, you know, if he wants to answer that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| There are two different processes involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| One is the zoning process, which would create a development plan for the entire 29-acre tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3938)|
| 1:05:48| Is that all the tracks added together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| That is the mechanism that controls the number of housing units that can be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| We keep a tally on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| In the event that there weren't 145 housing units approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| someone could come back and ask for more up to that 145 unit cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| That brings up a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| What if this lady sort of jumps in front of the line of everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| and takes them from these other adjoining and they use them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| I guess that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| But I guess that my original, getting back to my original question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| if this lady decided to, I want to develop this into something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3986)|
| 1:06:36| if she came before a commission, would that be something she legally could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| Again, the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| With the approval, possibly approval of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| The first step is controlled by the zoning with the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| If there are not 145 units spoken for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| she would have the right to speak for her share of those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| Now, if they go through the subdivision process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| and there are deed restrictions attached that limit her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| she would be controlled by those deed restrictions to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| that there are agreements within the subdivision about releasing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| or there is civil action against whatever she might propose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| But she would still be controlled by the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| Could this commission not change the zoning ordinance at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| change the zoning on her property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Well, the development plan is approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| The zoning is approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Approved at planned residential up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| In order to go beyond five units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| you would have to get a plan amendment first to go to a medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| or moderate density residential approved by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| and then come back and change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| So there would be two steps involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| But there is a process that that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| May I speak to that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Even though there would be a process where that under some hypothetical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| situation that she might be able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| there are going to be subdivision restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| which will limit her ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| She's going to have a new survey of her property showing that it's part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| the new subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| and it will detail on her new survey that she's part of this other subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| and limit the number of homes that can be built on her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| Further, there's a deed restriction, which goes with the new plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| which codifies those restrictions as to what she can do in forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| including development of commercial property and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Many of you are familiar with Gibbs Drive, I believe, in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| Gibbs Drive has been able to resist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| and there's a two-and-a-half acre vacant lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| which is worth several millions of dollars if it could be rezoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| on Gibbs Drive on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| And that property has a deed restriction on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| which specifically says it can never be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| it's part of the subdivision that's behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| The subdivision that's behind it has to vote unanimously for that property to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| used for anything else other than residential purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| I think they've been trying for 35 years, at some effort or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| to try to get those deed restrictions overturned in the limit of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| that is on that property on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| And nobody's been able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| It's gone all the way to the United States Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| It has never and will not, apparently, ever be overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| We have exactly the same kind of restriction on the properties on Tipton Station Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| that are going to be joining our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Exactly the same type of restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| I understand that, but that's not going to be what we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| I mean, that's sort of outside, that's an agreement between you and another party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| It's not an agreement between us and anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| I mean, we would be approving the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| and MPC would approve, I guess, your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| But, I mean, we can't do contingency zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| So, I mean, it would just be your good word that that actually happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| No, it's not a contingency zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| They're joining the subdivision, which is the reason that the district is being combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| What I'm talking about is the deed restriction part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| The deed restriction would be between you and that property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Well, I believe that Mr. Donaldson has checked on that, and I volunteered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| I said we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| The subdivision plan is going to refer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| The new survey is going to refer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| So we've already stated that those things will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| And if they join the subdivision, it has to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| because their deed has to be modified to show that they've joined a new subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| that whatever they had had previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| they are changing whatever they had previously to join the new subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| and agree to the restrictions that are going to be put forward by that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| And the zoning ordinance provides the Planning Commission to require deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| within a planned residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| You know, this whole thing has gotten, you know, sort of spun out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4268)|
| 1:11:16| Whether or not this is transfer development rights or something similar to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| and you want to call it something else, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| it's sort of spurred up this whole discussion of it, regardless of your intent, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| And last month we passed asking MPC to take a look at transfer development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4290)|
| 1:11:40| but I think I'd like to modify that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| and ask for a commission to approve a task force of citizens, nine citizens, one from every district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4303)|
| 1:11:53| to look into transfer development rights, not necessarily for this, but for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4313)|
| 1:12:01| and to have MPC help facilitate that process so that in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| when possible transfer development right issues come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| we can have a zoning ordinance that sort of dictates how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| So, you know, I would like to put that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| I don't know if that's in order or not, but I think we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| And what we eventually do with this, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| Mr. Chairman, may I suggest that Commissioner Luthe holds on to something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| but this is a relatively new tactic or technique, regardless of its merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4361)|
| 1:12:49| and that perhaps we should postpone this item before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| and appoint the citizens committee that he speaks of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| I think that would be the appropriate motion because it would involve this as well as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| This item before us as well as that larger issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| Well, we would have to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| I don't know for how many days it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| I would assume that by the time we have public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| and by the time they could draft something, get it before this body, it could take a number of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| I don't know how quickly that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| Something like 90 days would be inappropriate, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| Well, we probably couldn't even appoint them until next month because we'd have to come back next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| to come up with names and then to appoint them next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| So it would take even longer, maybe 90 days beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| That would be fine by me as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| I think that's the proper way to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| But I'm not sure if this impacts that, but I do think it's something that this commission needs to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| and I don't know if we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| I think we can do them simultaneously on one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| To defer this motion, let's say 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| Each commissioner appoints someone to the citizen's body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| Well, each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| Each commission district appoint one person to the citizen panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| and defer this motion until the completion of that body's work anticipated at the end of 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4451)|
| 1:14:19| Are you making that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| I'll get back to what we talked about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| Mr. Jernigan, as he said, does not own those properties along Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| When you take development rights, units, whatever you want to call them, from one person and move it to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4483)|
| 1:14:51| that's a transfer, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| So we're transferring something over here to another piece of property, which these folks don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| And Mr. Leuthold, he answered your question both ways a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| You asked if that could ever be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| No, it cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Once this is set in the deed restrictions, it's there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| So these folks that own this property down here, their grandkids come along 20 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| Suppose a lady on number 24, she comes along and she dies, her grandkids decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| well, we want to put, you know, half a dozen condos in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| Uh-oh, you can't because it's already been deed restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| So, you know, a rose by any other name is still a rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| So we need to keep that in mind when you're looking at this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| Mark, this is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| I'm concerned about this because this is somewhere we've never been before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| You keep trying to tell me we do it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| But on these development rights, look at the map here, 131, partial 131.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4560)|
| 1:16:11| What would keep somebody from just saying, coming up the road there and saying that's part of a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| and it's not even adjacent to the property they've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| What would keep them from doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| They'd have to amend the zoning so that they would be included within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| But if it was zone 5 an acre, if it was zone 5 an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| what would keep them from coming up through there and just saying, I want to be part of this subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| The past practice has been to allow the development plan to control side-by-side common zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4598)|
| 1:16:47| And I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| Brandywine at Turkey Creek, which the final component of which the zoning was approved in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4610)|
| 1:16:58| and the development plan was also approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| that took four different planned residential zone districts side-by-side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| and had a development plan approved for all four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| There were three different owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| And the density is shifting around within that planned residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| but it's being capped by what the planned district is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| And I can't remember if it's 4 or 5, but I think it's 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| But those three different owners, did they develop their property theirself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| They will be keeping a portion of that property for themselves on a large piece of property, multiple acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4651)|
| 1:17:40| and literally the density is moving elsewhere within that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| Well, on this here you have two different owners, but one of them is not building anything on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| And what I'm saying is we need to have some guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| I'm not saying I'm against selling building rights, but we have no guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| What I'm saying, what would keep Mr. Jornigan, if he couldn't get this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| from going up Tipton Station Road and talking to people in 131 right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| and saying, I want to buy your development rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| The process that we've created by making them go through the zoning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| to eliminate a line between two planned residential districts would create a public hearing like this in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4696)|
| 1:18:25| Up to Mr. Jornigan's case, the Planning Commission has always treated two side-by-side planned residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4705)|
| 1:18:33| with the same density as a single district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| So up until this particular application, that was done very commonly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4716)|
| 1:18:43| This Brandywine at Turkey Creek was one that was just completed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| Four different rezonings, three different property owners, all controlled by a single development plan now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4728)|
| 1:18:56| I have a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| These folks on Tipton Station Road here, other than the fact that they were paid for the rights to use these units over on his piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4738)|
| 1:19:10| what advantage do they have by joining his subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| We haven't been a part of that negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| You'd have to ask Mr. Jornigan about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| They will be part of a controlled planned unit development that will have standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| so there is some protection to what the future development around them will look like by becoming part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4770)|
| 1:19:38| I know these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| You're talking about people who have been here most of them longer than you are years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4780)|
| 1:19:49| So I don't see an advantage for them to be a part of this subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| other than the fact that the money that Mr. Jornigan is going to pay them to buy their units to move over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| Could we ask Mr. Ballard to come back up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| Mr. Pinkston has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| You held your hand up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| You'd like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| There's been several points that Brian brought up that I'd like to attempt to clarify and some very, very good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4812)|
| 1:20:20| First off, back to what Mr. Leuthold was talking about, Commissioner Leuthold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| the reason we're having all this discussion and everything is because of what I pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| There is no process procedure anywhere in Knox County ordinances that helps us do this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4831)|
| 1:20:38| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| So you've got to remember that, and that's why we've got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| And those questions will remain, and they need to be answered before we allow this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| I commend the opportunity to put together a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| I've always supported that and felt like that's the way our government needs to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| And I think that that needs to come beforehand because if you go ahead and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| then we've got to deal with this precedence that's being set, and how do you turn around and change those rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| Another quick point is on the issue of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| A piece of property that has been rezoned from agricultural to planned residential, five dwelling units or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4876)|
| 1:21:25| if I own that property, there is nothing that prevents me from coming back a few months, a year, two years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4885)|
| 1:21:33| and applying for another rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Now, as Mark Donaldson has pointed out, you'd have to get through the hurdles and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| But if we're all gone, okay, and things have changed out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| I have a right as a property owner to apply for a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| and could put together a pretty good case for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| In other words, we didn't know what was happening back in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| My family was taken advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| And I'm not saying anybody's taking advantage of anybody, but I'm just making an example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| The last point with regard to what Mr. Pinkston brought up, and Mark didn't really answer that directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4926)|
| 1:22:15| I didn't feel like, we've got these, again, we've got these different zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922businesspart2zoning?start=4935)|
