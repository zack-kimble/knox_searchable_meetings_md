| 5:40:37| people to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20437)|
| 5:40:39| their medications. Basically the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20439)|
| 5:40:41| services that they provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20441)|

| 5:40:45| individual basis in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20445)|
| 5:40:47| of what is putting that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20447)|
| 5:40:49| at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20449)|

| 5:41:03| those kinds of situations. But whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20463)|

| 5:41:13| what that case manager will either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20473)|
| 5:41:15| deal with directly or mobilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20475)|
| 5:41:17| a resource, whether it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20477)|
| 5:41:19| volunteer or another agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20479)|
| 5:41:21| to do whatever has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20481)|
| 5:41:23| to be done. It can be cleaning an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20483)|
| 5:41:25| apartment, it can be dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20485)|
| 5:41:27| housekeeping issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20487)|
| 5:41:29| getting someone to a doctor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20489)|
| 5:41:31| office, trying to make sure people are taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20491)|
| 5:41:33| their medications on time. You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20493)|
| 5:41:35| It's just whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20495)|
| 5:41:37| it requires to maintain housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20497)|
| 5:41:39| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20499)|
| 5:41:41| Brenda, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20501)|
| 5:41:43| No, I'm sorry. I was asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20503)|
| 5:41:45| Barbara, thank you so much for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20505)|
| 5:41:47| that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20507)|
| 5:41:49| I'm talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20509)|
| 5:41:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20511)|
| 5:41:53| I think sometimes what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20513)|
| 5:41:55| need to do is figure out how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20515)|
| 5:41:57| toot your horn more. When you think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20517)|
| 5:41:59| that 4,776| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20519)|
| 5:42:01| children are going to have meals this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20521)|
| 5:42:03| summer, that's phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20523)|
| 5:42:05| Okay, that's meals, not children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20525)|
| 5:42:07| I'm sorry. What I would say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20527)|
| 5:42:09| serve 229,240| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20529)|
| 5:42:11| summer meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20531)|
| 5:42:13| to 4,776| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20533)|
| 5:42:15| children. So those individual children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20535)|
| 5:42:17| and that number of meals, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20537)|
| 5:42:19| That's just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20539)|
| 5:42:21| Congratulations. Keep up the good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20541)|
| 5:42:23| We contract with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20543)|
| 5:42:25| Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20545)|
| 5:42:27| and it has a double purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20547)|
| 5:42:29| because many of the people that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20549)|
| 5:42:31| ordinarily not have work in the summertime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20551)|
| 5:42:33| get to work year-round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20553)|
| 5:42:35| and prepare this food for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20555)|
| 5:42:37| The dairy gets to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20557)|
| 5:42:39| sell and deliver milk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20559)|
| 5:42:41| so it has a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20561)|
| 5:42:43| benefits, but the main one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20563)|
| 5:42:45| to try to see to it that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20565)|
| 5:42:47| children have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20567)|
| 5:42:49| a nutritious meal. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20569)|
| 5:42:51| Okay. Mr. Dellivotti, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20571)|
| 5:42:53| Yes, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20573)|
| 5:42:55| Yeah, Barbara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20575)|
| 5:42:57| the pie chart you have in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20577)|
| 5:42:59| handout has that humongous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20579)|
| 5:43:01| yellow chunk that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20581)|
| 5:43:03| is 73% of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20583)|
| 5:43:05| basically. How many different federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20585)|
| 5:43:07| agencies are involved in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20587)|
| 5:43:09| I could picture HUD, but there's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20589)|
| 5:43:11| food and drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20591)|
| 5:43:13| or some other people that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20593)|
| 5:43:15| different agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20595)|
| 5:43:17| responsibilities that help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20597)|
| 5:43:19| There are a few federal agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20599)|
| 5:43:21| that are not involved, let me just put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20601)|
| 5:43:23| that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20603)|
| 5:43:25| That is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20605)|
| 5:43:27| of the things that we really pride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20607)|
| 5:43:29| ourselves on, that we can work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20609)|
| 5:43:31| just about any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20611)|
| 5:43:33| governmental agency, any state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20613)|
| 5:43:35| agency. We can deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20615)|
| 5:43:37| with their accounting system. We can deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20617)|
| 5:43:39| with their reporting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20619)|
| 5:43:41| We can deal with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20621)|
| 5:43:43| likes and dislikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20623)|
| 5:43:45| Basically, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20625)|
| 5:43:47| probably deal with 22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20627)|
| 5:43:49| different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20629)|
| 5:43:51| agencies, parts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20631)|
| 5:43:53| agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20633)|
| 5:43:55| from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20635)|
| 5:43:57| Some of them are unlikely. You wouldn't think of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20637)|
| 5:43:59| The vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20639)|
| 5:44:01| that we use for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20641)|
| 5:44:03| volunteer assisted transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20643)|
| 5:44:05| are vehicles that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20645)|
| 5:44:07| come from air quality control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20647)|
| 5:44:09| because they're hybrids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20649)|
| 5:44:11| It's not transit money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20651)|
| 5:44:13| It's environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20653)|
| 5:44:15| protection agency money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20655)|
| 5:44:17| There are things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20657)|
| 5:44:19| you just have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20659)|
| 5:44:21| creative and flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20661)|
| 5:44:23| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20663)|
| 5:44:25| willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20665)|
| 5:44:27| pound a few square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20667)|
| 5:44:29| pegs into some round holes on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20669)|
| 5:44:31| Like others have said, we certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20671)|
| 5:44:33| appreciate the work that your organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20673)|

| 5:44:39| We really couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20679)|
| 5:44:41| do it without you. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20681)|
| 5:44:43| Thank you again. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20683)|
| 5:44:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20685)|

| 5:45:21| I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20721)|
| 5:45:23| everybody's doing okay. City Court's running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20723)|
| 5:45:25| pretty well, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20725)|
| 5:45:27| Ticket writing is somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20727)|
| 5:45:29| down. I will say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20729)|
| 5:45:31| Valerie can talk to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20731)|
| 5:45:33| We're pleased to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20733)|
| 5:45:35| We appreciate your consideration of our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20735)|

| 5:45:39| I'd like to particularly thank you for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20739)|
| 5:45:41| construction work that was done over there in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20741)|
| 5:45:43| The office is much larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20743)|
| 5:45:45| now and we have a lot more room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20745)|
| 5:45:47| People aren't bumping into each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20747)|
| 5:45:49| and we really appreciate what the city did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20749)|
| 5:45:51| and thank you very much for that expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20751)|
| 5:45:53| How's collections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20753)|

| 5:48:15| the parking tickets are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20895)|

| 5:48:23| Any questions, Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20903)|
| 5:48:25| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20905)|

| 5:48:31| Yes, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20911)|
| 5:48:33| Is a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20913)|
| 5:48:35| of the ticket drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20915)|
| 5:48:37| off, the red light camera laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20917)|
| 5:48:39| being changed so that you can make the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20919)|
| 5:48:41| turn and all that stuff? In other words, what do you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20921)|
| 5:48:43| the cause is for citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20923)|
| 5:48:45| being down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20925)|
| 5:48:47| The red light camera citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20927)|
| 5:48:49| are a little bit different, but those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20929)|
| 5:48:51| have, the number of those has gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20931)|
| 5:48:53| down since. They cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20933)|
| 5:48:55| do the right turn on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20935)|
| 5:48:57| red. But we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20937)|
| 5:48:59| do have a lot of people that are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20939)|
| 5:49:01| I guess more people, those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20941)|
| 5:49:03| come to appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20943)|
| 5:49:05| the red light camera tickets than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20945)|
| 5:49:07| usual. Are coming to court to appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20947)|
| 5:49:09| They come to court to appeal it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20949)|
| 5:49:11| and we have KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20951)|
| 5:49:13| representative and someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20953)|
| 5:49:15| from the law department actually takes them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20955)|
| 5:49:17| back to view the video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20957)|
| 5:49:19| first to say, are you sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20959)|
| 5:49:21| that you want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20961)|
| 5:49:23| this wasn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20963)|
| 5:49:25| Before they actually come out and see the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20965)|
| 5:49:27| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20967)|
| 5:49:29| we actually had one the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20969)|
| 5:49:31| that was kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20971)|
| 5:49:33| strange where a young lady said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20973)|
| 5:49:35| yes, that was her tag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20975)|
| 5:49:37| on that vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20977)|
| 5:49:39| But that it wasn't her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20979)|
| 5:49:41| car and it wasn't her driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20981)|
| 5:49:43| it. So the judge asked her, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20983)|
| 5:49:45| where is your tag? And she said, well, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20985)|
| 5:49:47| at my house on my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20987)|
| 5:49:49| So he's like, so you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20989)|
| 5:49:51| someone stole your tag, put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20991)|
| 5:49:53| on their car, got a red light camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20993)|
| 5:49:55| ticket, came back and put your tag back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20995)|
| 5:49:57| on your car and then went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20997)|
| 5:49:59| So it can be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=20999)|
| 5:50:01| entertaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21001)|
| 5:50:03| sometimes, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21003)|
| 5:50:05| red light cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21005)|
| 5:50:07| they are down to. But I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21007)|
| 5:50:09| say a lot of people do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21009)|
| 5:50:11| pay those once they get their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21011)|
| 5:50:13| late notice in the mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21013)|
| 5:50:15| and those are turned over to a collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21015)|
| 5:50:17| agency by ATS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21017)|

| 5:51:19| peak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21079)|
| 5:51:21| it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21081)|
| 5:51:23| off the top of your head just a ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21083)|
| 5:51:25| number. I know you're comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21085)|
| 5:51:27| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21087)|
| 5:51:29| I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21089)|
| 5:51:31| maybe $400,000 or $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21091)|
| 5:51:33| Somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21093)|
| 5:51:35| It's less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21095)|
| 5:51:37| half of what it was at the peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21097)|
| 5:51:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21099)|
| 5:51:41| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21101)|
| 5:51:43| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21103)|
| 5:51:45| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21105)|
| 5:51:47| I hope graduation went well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21107)|
| 5:51:51| We've had a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21111)|
| 5:51:53| eventful day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21113)|
| 5:51:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21115)|
| 5:51:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21117)|
| 5:51:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21119)|
| 5:52:05| Jim, while the mayor is coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21125)|
| 5:52:07| or Christy, were there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21127)|
| 5:52:09| capital projects or anything that we did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21129)|
| 5:52:11| hit on that different departments did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21131)|
| 5:52:13| There's lots of capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21133)|
| 5:52:15| Any particular ones that come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21135)|
| 5:52:17| to mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21137)|
| 5:52:19| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21139)|
| 5:52:21| Obviously engineering has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21141)|
| 5:52:23| quite a big burden on their capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21143)|
| 5:52:25| projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21145)|
| 5:52:27| That's where a lot of the money is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21147)|
| 5:52:29| in redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21149)|
| 5:52:31| Throughout the day we've hit on all of those, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21151)|
| 5:52:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21153)|
| 5:52:35| Mayor, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21155)|
| 5:52:37| I thought we had an extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21157)|
| 5:52:39| good discussion Saturday week ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21159)|
| 5:52:41| in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21161)|
| 5:52:43| the council retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21163)|
| 5:52:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21165)|
| 5:52:47| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21167)|
| 5:52:49| Thank you. First I want to apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21169)|
| 5:52:51| for not being here this morning as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21171)|
| 5:52:53| sent you all an email and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21173)|
| 5:52:55| my fifth grade, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21175)|
| 5:52:57| grandson Silas graduated from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21177)|
| 5:52:59| fifth grade at Pleasant Ridge Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21179)|
| 5:53:01| Grandma had to be there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21181)|
| 5:53:03| watch him accept his three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21183)|
| 5:53:05| awards that he received, certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21185)|
| 5:53:07| That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21187)|
| 5:53:09| fun. I know I caught a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21189)|
| 5:53:11| glimpse in between meetings today of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21191)|
| 5:53:13| your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21193)|
| 5:53:15| You all must be exhausted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21195)|
| 5:53:17| because this went on all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21197)|
| 5:53:19| I'm here to answer any questions you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21199)|
| 5:53:21| have. I would just say in general that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21201)|
| 5:53:23| when you put together a budget like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21203)|
| 5:53:25| we focus on number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21205)|
| 5:53:27| just the basic services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21207)|
| 5:53:29| public safety being a huge part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21209)|
| 5:53:31| as well as public service, those kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21211)|
| 5:53:33| services that people expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21213)|
| 5:53:35| in a city. We also focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21215)|
| 5:53:37| on the capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21217)|
| 5:53:39| that we have been for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21219)|
| 5:53:41| this is now maybe the third or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21221)|
| 5:53:43| fourth administration that has really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21223)|
| 5:53:45| focused on capital investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21225)|
| 5:53:47| We know that a lot of places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21227)|
| 5:53:49| cities don't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21229)|
| 5:53:51| and that's why you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21231)|
| 5:53:53| crumbling buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21233)|
| 5:53:55| and bridges and sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21235)|
| 5:53:57| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21237)|
| 5:53:59| We have focused on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21239)|
| 5:54:01| built infrastructure, making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21241)|
| 5:54:03| we reinvest and we have seen that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21243)|
| 5:54:05| pay off with a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21245)|
| 5:54:07| private investment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21247)|
| 5:54:09| has followed. You all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21249)|
| 5:54:11| know exactly what I'm talking about. We see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21251)|
| 5:54:13| every council meeting with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21253)|
| 5:54:15| new projects that are starting up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21255)|
| 5:54:17| Then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21257)|
| 5:54:19| focus on quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21259)|
| 5:54:21| and that's the parks and greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21261)|
| 5:54:23| and urban wilderness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21263)|
| 5:54:25| arts and culture and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21265)|
| 5:54:27| kinds of investments. And then finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21267)|
| 5:54:29| we focus on people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21269)|
| 5:54:31| and the human capital that we want to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21271)|
| 5:54:33| in. You just talked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21273)|
| 5:54:35| CAC about some of the work they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21275)|
| 5:54:37| A lot of what community development does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21277)|
| 5:54:39| the office on homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21279)|
| 5:54:41| community relations, the Save Our Sons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21281)|
| 5:54:43| initiative and such. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21283)|
| 5:54:45| are all really trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21285)|
| 5:54:47| help those who need it the most in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21287)|
| 5:54:49| community so that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21289)|
| 5:54:51| benefits and everybody does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21291)|
| 5:54:53| well. So as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21293)|
| 5:54:55| we put together this budget, we try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21295)|
| 5:54:57| balance those different needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21297)|
| 5:54:59| and it's like putting together pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21299)|
| 5:55:01| of a puzzle sometimes to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21301)|
| 5:55:03| where the right balance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21303)|
| 5:55:05| on all of that, what we should invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21305)|
| 5:55:07| more in this year versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21307)|
| 5:55:09| what we might have invested in last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21309)|
| 5:55:11| But ultimately we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21311)|
| 5:55:13| piece that all together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21313)|
| 5:55:15| based on conversations I've had with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21315)|
| 5:55:17| all along the way and then present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21317)|
| 5:55:19| the budget. So I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21319)|
| 5:55:21| here, I'm sure Christy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21321)|
| 5:55:23| Bill and all the staff and Jim answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21323)|
| 5:55:25| your questions throughout the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21325)|
| 5:55:27| but if there's anything in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21327)|
| 5:55:29| you'd like to ask of me, I'd be glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21329)|
| 5:55:31| call on Bill or Christy or Jim to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21331)|
| 5:55:33| answer it. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21333)|
| 5:55:35| sure if you were here or not, but one of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21335)|
| 5:55:37| some of us have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21337)|
| 5:55:39| concerned about or at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21339)|
| 5:55:41| interested in, as you know, are sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21341)|
| 5:55:43| and that we had talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21343)|
| 5:55:45| with Christy about the possibility of looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21345)|
| 5:55:47| at different alternatives or maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21347)|
| 5:55:49| possibilities of ways in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21349)|
| 5:55:51| we might be able to fund sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21351)|
| 5:55:53| whether it's a joint effort between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21353)|
| 5:55:55| property owner and whatever, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21355)|
| 5:55:57| if that dialogue or that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21357)|
| 5:55:59| could start or continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21359)|
| 5:56:01| to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21361)|
| 5:56:03| Yeah, we'd be glad to do that. We have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21363)|
| 5:56:05| it'd be a continuation really in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21365)|
| 5:56:07| figuring out how we can scale this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21367)|
| 5:56:09| more. We have several, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21369)|
| 5:56:11| there are several major projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21371)|
| 5:56:13| before us to decide about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21373)|
| 5:56:15| with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21375)|
| 5:56:17| Civic Auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21377)|
| 5:56:19| and Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21379)|
| 5:56:21| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21381)|
| 5:56:23| sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21383)|
| 5:56:25| I'm blanking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21385)|
| 5:56:27| Anyway, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21387)|
| 5:56:29| you know, figuring out what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21389)|
| 5:56:31| with the Supreme Court Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21391)|
| 5:56:33| Supreme Court site, McClung Warehouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21393)|
| 5:56:35| Possible parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21395)|
| 5:56:37| Yes, additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21397)|
| 5:56:39| parking that might be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21399)|
| 5:56:41| All of those, so there are some pretty major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21401)|
| 5:56:43| Where the police are going to go maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21403)|
| 5:56:45| Right, thank you, that was my other one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21405)|
| 5:56:47| Where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21407)|
| 5:56:49| police, where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21409)|
| 5:56:51| safety building would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21411)|
| 5:56:53| So we have a lot of big ticket items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21413)|
| 5:56:55| and I think with sidewalks should also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21415)|
| 5:56:57| be on the table as we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21417)|
| 5:56:59| how these different initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21419)|
| 5:57:01| get funded, so we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21421)|
| 5:57:03| definitely look at that and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21423)|
| 5:57:05| back in touch with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21425)|
| 5:57:07| Council, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21427)|
| 5:57:11| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21431)|
| 5:57:13| You're going to end the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21433)|
| 5:57:15| Mayor, we didn't get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21435)|
| 5:57:17| capital improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21437)|
| 5:57:19| program until lunch time today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21439)|
| 5:57:21| so I haven't really had a chance to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21441)|
| 5:57:23| but I assume that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21443)|
| 5:57:25| whatever that is, $25 million or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21445)|
| 5:57:27| that doesn't all get spent in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21447)|
| 5:57:29| year, right? That's the project approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21449)|
| 5:57:31| that extends to however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21451)|
| 5:57:33| long it takes to build it, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21453)|
| 5:57:35| Or am I misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21455)|
| 5:57:37| these figures in the book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21457)|
| 5:57:39| Well, what we allocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21459)|
| 5:57:41| now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21461)|
| 5:57:43| for this, say July 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21463)|
| 5:57:45| for projects, the $27 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21465)|
| 5:57:47| those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21467)|
| 5:57:49| will start this year but many of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21469)|
| 5:57:51| will take multiple years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21471)|
| 5:57:53| in order to be completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21473)|
| 5:57:55| But the appropriation is for the estimated cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21475)|
| 5:57:57| of the project that takes however long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21477)|
| 5:57:59| it takes to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21479)|
| 5:58:01| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21481)|
| 5:58:03| I was just curious because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21483)|
| 5:58:05| hadn't had a chance to study it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21485)|
| 5:58:07| As you recall, there will be projects that will come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21487)|
| 5:58:09| each council and it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21489)|
| 5:58:11| be right-of-ways, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21491)|
| 5:58:13| it may take us a year to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21493)|
| 5:58:15| the right-of-ways for a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21495)|
| 5:58:17| say for a drainage or a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21497)|
| 5:58:19| or whatever, and the funding was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21499)|
| 5:58:21| a certain year, but you do your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21501)|
| 5:58:23| design, you have to actually design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21503)|
| 5:58:25| it, you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21505)|
| 5:58:27| complete all those documents, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21507)|
| 5:58:29| to do your right-of-way purchase often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21509)|
| 5:58:31| Anyway, it goes on, it's a multi-phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21511)|
| 5:58:33| process for many of these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21513)|
| 5:58:35| Sometimes the allocation is just for the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21515)|
| 5:58:37| and right-of-way phase or just the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21517)|
| 5:58:39| phase. It might be a phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21519)|
| 5:58:41| of the project. Yes, a phase and then you'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21521)|
| 5:58:43| next year or the further year out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21523)|
| 5:58:45| it might jump up and that's because it's actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21525)|
| 5:58:47| construction. So it's not a total cost picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21527)|
| 5:58:49| Some of these might be but not all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21529)|
| 5:58:51| of them. All in one year, yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21531)|
| 5:58:53| One of the things that we try and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21533)|
| 5:58:55| in the capital is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21535)|
| 5:58:57| have your total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21537)|
| 5:58:59| project costs, that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21539)|
| 5:59:01| right-of-way acquisition, design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21541)|
| 5:59:03| and so forth, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21543)|
| 5:59:05| as construction, all the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21545)|
| 5:59:07| all in place because it really doesn't make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21547)|
| 5:59:09| to start and not finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21549)|
| 5:59:11| start and not finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21551)|
| 5:59:13| That's what we hope to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21553)|
| 5:59:15| with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21555)|
| 5:59:17| these capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21557)|
| 5:59:19| Again, we're not always successful in doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21559)|
| 5:59:21| but that's our goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21561)|
| 5:59:23| So we don't want to start on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21563)|
| 5:59:25| unless we know we have the money for all of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21565)|
| 5:59:27| We'll see, as Christy was saying, bits and pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21567)|
| 5:59:29| of it as we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21569)|
| 5:59:31| different contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21571)|
| 5:59:33| for that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21573)|
| 5:59:35| as it goes over several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21575)|
| 5:59:37| The whole project won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21577)|
| 5:59:39| be bid out or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21579)|
| 5:59:41| contracts won't be written all at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21581)|
| 5:59:43| for the whole project. It's timed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21583)|
| 5:59:45| With regard to that community center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21585)|
| 5:59:47| the information we saw was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21587)|
| 5:59:49| $200,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21589)|
| 5:59:51| for two years. Is that, I'm not sure what you call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21591)|
| 5:59:53| Change center? Change center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21593)|
| 5:59:55| $250,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21595)|
| 5:59:57| Total or each year? For each of two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21597)|
| 5:59:59| Total, half a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21599)|
| 6:00:01| That's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21601)|
| 6:00:03| And the other question was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21603)|
| 6:00:05| I assume the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21605)|
| 6:00:07| zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21607)|
| 6:00:09| re-evaluation consulting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21609)|
| 6:00:11| contract will be an operational cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21611)|
| 6:00:13| that we just haven't appropriated yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21613)|
| 6:00:15| It's not in the capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21615)|
| 6:00:17| It's not in the capital budget, Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21617)|
| 6:00:19| It would be an operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21619)|
| 6:00:21| It is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21621)|
| 6:00:23| You heard me earlier, but there's a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21623)|
| 6:00:25| amendment on, should be on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21625)|
| 6:00:27| agenda for next Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21627)|
| 6:00:29| We'll add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21629)|
| 6:00:31| In this current budget year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21631)|
| 6:00:33| It's going to be in the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21633)|
| 6:00:35| budget year, not the one you're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21635)|
| 6:00:37| In the 15-16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21637)|
| 6:00:39| budget, and so you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21639)|
| 6:00:41| have a budget amendment again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21641)|
| 6:00:43| on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21643)|
| 6:00:45| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21645)|
| 6:00:47| Any other questions to the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=21647)|

| 6:12:01| we have, in the core of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22321)|
| 6:12:03| a population that's in dystopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22323)|
| 6:12:10| And there is a segment of us in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22330)|
| 6:12:13| who feel that the level of interest of our governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22333)|
| 6:12:21| and our institutions have not nearly reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22341)|
| 6:12:26| the level of concern that's necessary to assist us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22346)|
| 6:12:32| in this liberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22352)|

| 6:12:44| How I can speak to three areas in a minute, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22364)|
| 6:12:50| One area had to deal with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22370)|
| 6:12:52| That was engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22372)|
| 6:12:55| One area dealt with parks, and one with community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22375)|
| 6:13:01| So how do we negotiate this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22381)|
| 6:13:04| Sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22384)|
| 6:13:08| I asked the Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22388)|
| 6:13:11| to install sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22391)|

| 6:13:22| to Wilson Avenue and Hembury, I said to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22402)|
| 6:13:28| that that's been a 30-year effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22408)|
| 6:13:31| and nothing has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22411)|
| 6:13:33| We have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22413)|
| 6:13:34| Your time is up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22414)|

| 6:13:45| of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22425)|

| 6:13:57| we have a plethora of young families with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22437)|
| 6:14:03| Also at that intersection, we have an expanded park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22443)|
| 6:14:06| for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22446)|
| 6:14:09| At the eastern end, we have a YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22449)|
| 6:14:12| Well, no, it's not the YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22452)|

| 6:14:31| having to negotiate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22471)|
| 6:14:34| That is a straight street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22474)|
| 6:14:38| Young men between 19 and 27 with access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22478)|

| 6:14:48| It has nothing to do with race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22488)|
| 6:14:49| It's in our genes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22489)|

| 6:14:56| When you have that, you're going to drag race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22496)|
| 6:14:59| Racing takes place constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22499)|
| 6:15:01| There's going to be a killing along that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22501)|
| 6:15:05| and we need sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22505)|
| 6:15:06| And we need those sidewalks immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22506)|

| 6:15:28| We cannot get it done as we watch other parks developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22528)|
| 6:15:34| As we watch parks that are developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22534)|
| 6:15:36| get further developed, we want to get that park back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22536)|
| 6:15:41| to its 1975 status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22541)|
| 6:15:45| That's the Harriet Tubman Park on Harriet Tubman Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22545)|
| 6:15:50| And the third thing is the Magnolia Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22550)|

| 6:16:24| How Magnolia broke land to get $7, $8, $9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22584)|
| 6:16:30| and Magnolia is abandoned, we do not understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22590)|
| 6:16:34| We're asking that this council and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22594)|
| 6:16:39| reestablish Five Points as an economic development district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22599)|
| 6:16:47| worthy of the city putting funds, using pilot, TIFF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22607)|
| 6:16:53| and the bona fides that many banking institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22613)|
| 6:16:57| and industrial types see in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22617)|
| 6:17:03| to get development going in Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22623)|
| 6:17:05| We could only find two African-American property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22625)|
| 6:17:12| owners between Bertrand and Jasmine Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22632)|
| 6:17:23| That project has nothing to do with the advancement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22643)|
| 6:17:27| of the African-American community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22647)|
| 6:17:29| We need to recognize it, and we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22649)|
| 6:17:32| to do things with some priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22652)|
| 6:17:34| and Five Points is the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22654)|
| 6:17:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22656)|
| 6:17:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22657)|
| 6:17:41| We have Emanuel Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22661)|
| 6:17:45| Come forward and give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22665)|
| 6:17:48| You'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22668)|
| 6:17:56| My name is Emanuel Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22676)|
| 6:17:58| I reside at 3018 East Fifth Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22678)|
| 6:18:04| I only have two points to raise this year in relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22684)|
| 6:18:11| to our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22691)|
| 6:18:12| The first has to do with the Title VI program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22692)|
| 6:18:17| I know there is not currently a person in that staff position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22697)|
| 6:18:22| for Title VI, but the whole Title VI effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22702)|
| 6:18:27| which has to do with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22707)|
| 6:18:33| needs to have more stature in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22713)|
| 6:18:38| I saw that, and I know that from working with organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22718)|
| 6:18:43| that what happens is in our Title VI reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22723)|
| 6:18:45| we have laid down a training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22725)|
| 6:18:48| so that there is acknowledgment of Title VI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22728)|
| 6:18:51| and some of the issues related to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22731)|
| 6:18:53| but the compliance side is very weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22733)|
| 6:18:57| There needs to be some tests, and what Title VI says is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22737)|
| 6:19:01| that there shall be no discrimination in programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22741)|
| 6:19:04| dollars, access to issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22744)|
| 6:19:08| And what happens is we, as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22748)|
| 6:19:12| are not reviewing our contractees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22752)|
| 6:19:18| to do the compliance reviews, even in a sample level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22758)|
| 6:19:22| And without staff, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22762)|
| 6:19:24| So what I propose and recommend is that the city consider trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22764)|
| 6:19:31| to separate and establish a Title VI office for this purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22771)|
| 6:19:37| so they can start doing the compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22777)|
| 6:19:39| Right now, Title VI is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22779)|
| 6:19:40| under the Community Relations Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22780)|
| 6:19:44| If you were to go in and take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22784)|
| 6:19:46| at what you have posted on your website in relation to Title VI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22786)|
| 6:19:58| it starts out with talking about that there is compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22798)|
| 6:20:02| with the Civil Rights Act, but it starts talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22802)|
| 6:20:05| about limited English proficiency policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22805)|
| 6:20:09| and employee guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22809)|
| 6:20:11| It does not give enough emphasis to what it's supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22811)|
| 6:20:14| to be doing with equal opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22814)|
| 6:20:19| So that needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22819)|
| 6:20:21| And certainly, if there were staff there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22821)|
| 6:20:24| they could help lead this effort for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22824)|
| 6:20:29| The second thing that I'm concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22829)|
| 6:20:32| and that I think you should be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22832)|
| 6:20:35| about too is the deplorable record of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22835)|
| 6:20:41| that the city does with minority and African-American businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22841)|
| 6:20:47| We hardly do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22847)|
| 6:20:50| We're so bad, we don't even do the reporting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22850)|
| 6:20:55| That makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22855)|
| 6:20:57| Now, you're in the process of passing a budget and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22857)|
| 6:21:06| Boys' Coins could be here, but that's certainly your purchasing area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22866)|
| 6:21:12| that you have that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22872)|
| 6:21:14| But I would suggest that what you could do as council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22874)|
| 6:21:19| that you could actually put a rider on the budget as you pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22879)|
| 6:21:26| that gives some emphasis to trying to do something with minority businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22886)|
| 6:21:32| That's a very simple action that you can take as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22892)|
| 6:21:37| but it could have extremely significant impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22897)|
| 6:21:42| because there are the contractors and subcontractors and departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22902)|
| 6:21:45| that are going to be implementing this budget and at least they would know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22905)|
| 6:21:49| that there is seriousness on the part of our council and mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22909)|
| 6:21:54| That's all of my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22914)|
| 6:21:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22915)|
| 6:21:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22917)|
| 6:21:59| Being that there is no other folks signed up for public, oh, Amelia Parker, did she arrive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22919)|
| 6:22:10| And David Hayes, did he arrive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22930)|
| 6:22:15| Being that there's no other sign up for public forum, the meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=22935)|
