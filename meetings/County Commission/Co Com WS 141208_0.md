| 0:01:11| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Seven members present, we have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=72)|
| 0:01:27| I would ask if we have amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| I've got one if we can put it on for discussion, it's about the TCCA appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=94)|
| 0:01:46| We have an addition of a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=106)|
| 0:01:55| So we need to make note that item four and item 27, item four and item 28 are deferred to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=115)|
| 0:02:15| Item 27, I'm going to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| There's no button there to turn me on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=140)|
| 0:02:30| Item 27 is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| Also we need to add after the items that we're going to discuss today, a need for a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=157)|
| 0:02:47| for the special called meeting January the 12th to appoint the replacement Dr. Briggs vacant seat, the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=167)|
| 0:02:58| We've discussed it, but we did not have a motion made and properly seconded and voted on to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=178)|
| 0:03:07| For that public meeting and appointment meeting, the special called meeting on the 12th to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=187)|
| 0:03:21| No, we'll do that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| That's added to our agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| I'm going to defer item 14 for 30 days, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| Item 14 is deferred to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=219)|
| 0:03:48| And while we're at that point, the items that are not on consent are 9, 19, 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=228)|
| 0:04:07| Those are the three that were on the message this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| And then also we need to have a short discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| So I'm going to pull item 30 so we can talk about the paragraph related to the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=257)|
| 0:04:34| And then also we should have not for discussion today unless someone wishes to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| We need to add to the agenda for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=280)|

| 0:07:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=467)|
| 0:07:57| On page five, item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=477)|
| 0:08:09| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| a permit grant contract with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| in the amount of $167,160 for the Beaver Creek Watershed Restoration Initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| Phase 2, to help Knox County achieve requirements for water quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| under the current Knox County NPDES Phase 2 permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=506)|

| 0:08:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Motion is properly before us, and so is Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=534)|
| 0:09:01| Just for some clarification, of the match amount of $167,160,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| approximately $22,000 of cash match and the remaining $145,000 would be an in-kind match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=547)|
| 0:09:15| So that's not as big as it does seem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| And as contracts go, this occupied a lot of the digits in our today's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| Motion before us to send to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=568)|

| 0:09:42| On page 7, item number 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| amending the Knox County Commission rules to change the meeting times of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=590)|

| 0:10:15| Since the 5th District will not be represented with a full-time commissioner until January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=615)|
| 0:10:24| that this be postponed to a move to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| Just vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| I know we've got a Rules Committee meeting next week on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| but still it would be unfair to people in the 5th District to vote on it before they have a representation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=632)|
| 0:10:41| Is this a substitute motion or amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| Well, wherever you want to put it, but amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| Amend it to go to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| We're calling it amendment or a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| No, a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=658)|

| 0:11:05| The motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| Is there a second that this item be moved to January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=668)|

| 0:11:25| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| Ms. Jill and Mr. David over there, does this mean we still need to have our Rules Committee meeting on this next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=689)|
| 0:11:39| We're going to leave that up to Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| If it is properly noticed in the Knoxville papers, I believe it would be difficult to cancel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=702)|

| 0:12:23| And ordinance number 0-10-3-104, adopted April 26th, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| This is on first reading, ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| And let me address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| This is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| It is not normal that we take any action on an ordinance because it's to be read twice at full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=755)|
| 0:12:43| The reason that I ask that we discuss this today is to make sure that everyone look at the paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=763)|
| 0:12:51| that has been proposed by the Audit Committee and that that paragraph will have to be somewhat reworded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=771)|
| 0:13:00| because as a member of the Audit Committee, I remember us discussing that we would not use the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=780)|
| 0:13:07| investigate in this paragraph as it relates to the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=787)|
| 0:13:16| That discussion, though, can be held Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| One other thing then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| Just really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| I've asked Larry Elmore from Pew CPH to come and address this body on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| and he had a conflict today but he can be here next week to address you on his thoughts on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=817)|
| 0:13:45| Thank you for making that arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| That really fits in well because that's the meeting that we need to hear what I will refer to as auditor speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=827)|
| 0:13:56| and definitions would be more appropriate during that meeting than during this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| in which we are just having a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Mr. Brown, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| In the revised memorandum from Mr. Buick, that word is not in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=847)|
| 0:14:19| But it is on the website in the page of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| This is not on the website then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=863)|
| 0:14:32| Commissioner, I don't know what was on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| What Jill got was what Kim had extracted from the tape of what she thought was the final verbiage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=876)|
| 0:14:47| that the Audit Committee had come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| But that word investigation is not in this paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Do you want me to read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| Yes, sir, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Should the internal auditor receive any information which would give rise to the initiation of an audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| in the professional judgment of the county auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| the internal auditor shall immediately convey said information to the Chairman of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| and to the Chair of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| Upon consensus of the internal auditor and the Knox County Commission Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| the auditor shall commence an audit within the scope defined by the professional parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| defined by the AICPA and the GAGAS, the GAGAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=925)|
| 0:15:34| And I think that we also talked about those little pieces of boilerplate at the end not being necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| because that's by our charter what we work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| So there's several things that can be discussed at the Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| I just want everyone to be aware of the fact that how the internal auditor is directed by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| that the paragraph read the way we want it to read for this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| and then we can change it at some next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Do we have other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Do we need to move this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| No vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| No vote, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Again, this is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| This will be two readings of this at regular commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=987)|
| 0:16:36| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| We have a discussion item on the TCCA appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| I received a letter the other day from the TCCA Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| and it was given to directors of all around through this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| And the only one that is vacant is Knox County Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| Now, it says, I guess, on our line that the chairman of the commission is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1023)|
| 0:17:11| that automatically appoints and attends these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| And it's not just one meeting a month where they have it regionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| They have one a month while the legislation is in session that they can report to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| on legislation that's going on on the state and how it affects the different counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| And I was wondering why it was left vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| and how we can make sure that we've got shows that we have a representation from Knox County on the TCCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1051)|
| 0:17:42| I think that we will have to take that for a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| and we probably need more of the commission here to make sure that everyone's heard in that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1067)|
| 0:17:55| Well, the one thing we're doing is we're going to be talking about, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| looking for a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| But this is also a way of getting information, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| because I talked to Charlie Curtis at the TCCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| and he's informed me about what goes on on the TCCA and why you have to have representation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| Because they've already chosen their committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| like the road committees, the education committees, and all like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| they're doing that, I guess, following legislation in the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| and we have no representation on any committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| So we need to make sure that we get on there and we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| All right. We will add this as a discussion item for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1120)|
| 0:19:01| Are there other items that we have? Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| Add the special call meeting for January the 12th, 2015, for the election for the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1149)|
| 0:19:20| So I'll make a motion that we have an official meeting on January the 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| for hearing the presentations from the candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| and immediately after that we will have a vote to select that new commissioner for the 5th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| so they'll be available to take their seat at the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1178)|
| 0:19:49| The interview meeting is at 430? That's a part of your motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1189)|
| 0:19:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Okay. Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Motion and second is properly before us, establishing the time to interview candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| and appoint the person to fill the vacancy of the 5th District Commission seats properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Any opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1222)|
| 0:20:34| Okay. We had already established that there would be two discussion items added to the Monday agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| One, the conversations out of the Audit Committee related to the PPU and school activities funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1240)|
| 0:20:49| And the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| And a moment of silence will be added to the agenda Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| in recognition for those that have passed due to the horrendous occurrences of the bus accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1257)|
| 0:21:09| Are there other items of business that need to come before us at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| Is there anyone here that would like to address commission as a part of public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1276)|
| 0:21:25| If not, let me take a moment of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| I'm sorry, Mr. Thomas, I missed your light there just a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| No, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Then I'll go to your compatriot there beside you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| I appreciate Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| I believe he was principal of the day with the principal at Holston Middle School, Ashley Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1308)|
| 0:21:58| I'm sorry that I was unable to participate in that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Did other people take advantage of being principal for the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| I'd like to recognize Commissioner Owen for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1325)|
| 0:22:12| He was at Sequoia Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| I signed up, but I had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Then also for those that have paid attention to high school football, Webb, West, and Fulton are state champions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1340)|
| 0:22:32| Could we take it into consideration to recognize them at this coming Monday meeting as opposed to waiting until ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1352)|
| 0:22:42| Okay, Junko Jill, I hear your complaint already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| I'd already talked to Jill today or this morning about recognizing Fulton and West and Webb High School as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1370)|
| 0:23:00| for winning the state championships, and we're going to do it in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| It gives us a little bit more time to get all the information we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| Okay, so the recognition of those three high school football teams for their superb performance on the football field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1388)|
| 0:23:16| will be at the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| Also, Mr. Caldwell, could I ask you to deliver some word on behalf of commission to Mayor Burchett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1402)|
| 0:23:36| I believe there's been a couple of different meetings that some of the commissioners have been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| One dealing with the appointment selection of the Metropolitan Planning Commissioner Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1423)|
| 0:23:51| One complaint that we've heard twice, and I know it takes three times to be a landslide, but twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1431)|
| 0:24:00| the qualification not being there that the director of MPC be a college graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1440)|
| 0:24:09| I read that the requirements are very strict, and one would assume that the director of MPC would be a college degreed person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1449)|
| 0:24:25| but I'm hearing it from people in the community saying that needs to be used as a consideration point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| and I'm just passing that word along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| All those other qualifications that are listed there, it would be hard to have those without having a college degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| That's right, but I said that I would pass along the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| And then the second request, Mr. Caldwell, comes from the merchants at what I'll refer to as Easttown Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1491)|
| 0:25:00| and the second chance exit off of Interstate 640 needs to be advanced by the Regional Transportation Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1500)|
| 0:25:10| and Mayor Burchett is a member of that, so I'm officially passing that request from this chair to that member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1510)|
| 0:25:20| Are there other items that members of commission would like to discuss at this time as it relates to announcements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1520)|
| 0:25:28| or padding on the back because we've got two more minutes until we get to a half hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1528)|
| 0:25:36| After you adjourn, I need to see all of the commissioners over here for about two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| You said if I had any announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| The press is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Mr. Chairman, since you recognize that I went to Holston Middle School, may I give a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| Most certainly, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| I can't tell you how impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| When I discovered I was going to Holston Middle, I thought, well, I'm going out in East Knoxville somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| and who knows where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| I didn't know where the school was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| I mean, it's not right on a major road or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| I know you went there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| It doesn't have anything to do with it, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| I was so impressed with the beauty of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| It looks like it's brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| The children were absolutely amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Out of the 900 kids that are enrolled there, 600 of them are from the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| Now, this is unfortunate that those kids have to be bused every day, most of them up to 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| That's 600 children that go to a different community to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| Nothing wrong with the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| The principal's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| The teacher's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Every one of the principals made sure she got a grant and made sure that every one of those kids have an iPad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| Now, there's not many schools where every kid has an iPad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| So that 45-minute ride may be a good thing for those kids because they've got an iPad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| They get to take it home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| They do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| I mean, it was an amazing school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| I was really amazed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| So, Dr. McIntyre, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1639)|

| 0:28:03| and State Representatives Harry Brooks and Roger Kane to dedicate a bridge on Rutledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS141208?start=1683)|
