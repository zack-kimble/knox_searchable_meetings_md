| 0:02:36| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| The seven members are present. We have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| So we will move right into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| 4A is an emergency ordinance to amend Section 4-76 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| to create an additional category of special permits for temporary serving areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| at businesses holding city beer permits outside the Cumberland Avenue Corridor District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| I just wanted to ask how many of these, I guess the exception is that they're in Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| but how many of these applications do we get on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| and then how many are we expecting to get from this ordinance being passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| The ordinance allowing these on Cumberland Avenue was passed in the fall of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| So that was a brand new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| So as far as I know, there have been no applications under that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| The current ordinance under consideration tonight is based very heavily on what was passed for Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=223)|
| 0:03:52| I mean, it obviously would apply to a much larger area than simply Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| So it remains to be seen how many people will apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| Had we gotten some advance notice from area businesses that were interested in these types of permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Can you maybe expand on that a little bit, not just for us, but for the audience at home and those who are listening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| Well, it's my understanding that some restaurants were hoping to be able to celebrate Cinco de Mayo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| and that would, as the ordinance, as things presently are, they couldn't have an outdoor event tent or untented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=266)|
| 0:04:37| and this would allow them to do so and to be able to do so in order for this year's events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=277)|
| 0:04:45| That's all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| And this is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| This is an emergency ordinance, so it is effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| Effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Is there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| So then we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180405?start=312)|
