| 0:01:03| Commissioner Durrett, would you please lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=63)|
| 0:01:11| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| and to the republic for which it stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| one nation, under God, indivisible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=79)|
| 0:01:23| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=83)|
| 0:01:29| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| The purpose of this special meeting is to discuss the fiscal 2022 Knox County operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=91)|
| 0:01:40| We have three parts, and we have no one signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| So we will skip item number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| And we will welcome all of our department heads who are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| and open up the floor to commissioners to ask any questions of our department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| Are there any questions from our commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| And department heads, if you all, when you approach the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| if you could just state your name and your department for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| I apologize there for eating some sun chips, which are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=139)|
| 0:02:28| Sir, if you could state your name and department for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Chris Caldwell, finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| Our previous meeting, the sheriff's department asked for an 8% raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| and it was going to be, what, $900,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| Just so you know, we looked back, it's closer to 1-1 or 1-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| So I was a little low on that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| So it's about 1-1 to 1-2 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| If there was a motion made to grant that, where would that money come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| out of the general fund or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| Well, we have a fund balance policy that does not allow recurring expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| to be spent from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| So, in essence, you have to either find a revenue source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=189)|
| 0:03:19| or change some other expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| The policy is pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| It's one-time money for one-time expenses on fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| The sheriff's department, I know the sheriff's famer is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| He's not going to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| But, Allison, I guess you're the finance lady, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| Commissioner Daly, can I ask Chris a clarifying question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| while she works her way up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Everybody, just make sure you speak into your microphones, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| It's still a little hard to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Chris, is that 1-1, is that salary only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| or does that include you up in the star allocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| that would be required of the county with that increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| The 1-1 to 1-2 would be salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| And the impact, so it includes that portion of salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=247)|
| 0:04:16| What's not included is the impact next year they could have on UOP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| because it would increase our UOP contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| because it would increase the ARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| But I don't know, having to know what that number of that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| If you would state your name and your department for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| Allison Rogers, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| Allison, if we cannot find that $1.1 million in the budget here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| is there any, last year there was like $3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| that the sheriff's department didn't spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Can we, and this is for Chris, too, can we move that $1.1 million to the salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=294)|
| 0:05:03| You understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Yeah, that's the surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| It's also a one-time expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| So we could not use the surplus that we have in salaries from this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| We could not use it for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| Out of your budget this year, it's my understanding I cannot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| I can approve a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| but I cannot tell you how much to pay this person or pay that person or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| Out of your $97 million, what, is it $97 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Our sheriff's office budget will be $91 million if approved this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| Now that $91 million, cannot the sheriff give pay raises inside that $91 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| I'm just asking a question. Seriously, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| We've never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| I'm not sure if it's allowed under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| Chris, do you know if it's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| Well, it could be the same thing for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| It could be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| We don't tell the department head what to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| So I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| I think technically to answer your question, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| but the challenging part for them is they have already submitted a budget request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| and those expenses that are already in there are needed for the DF and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| So they don't have just that 1.2 set aside that they could just pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| Because if they pulled it from somewhere else, it's just got to come from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| So I think she would tell you what their budget request was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| versus what was approved from a contractual services and supplies standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=392)|
| 0:06:40| It's not like she has that free money just to move up to salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| When we have surplus, and I can tell you this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| Sheriff Spangler, he does like that idea to be given a certain amount of salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| and he can divvy it up amongst his employees as he would see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| He does like that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| As far as our surplus, it is not in operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| It's always in our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| We got about a half a million, I think, approved extra this year in operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| And on top of everything that we do from the DF to warrants to narcotics, everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| we're going to need every bit of that half a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| It cannot go into salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=439)|
| 0:07:29| I would love to find a way to get closer to that 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| You asked for 8%, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| That's what the sheriff has asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| He's asked for an additional, it's a three steps additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| for the captains and below in law enforcement and corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| And we've come back at the post-budget of only 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| It would be the two steps and 2% in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| and then an additional step in January for those officers, captain and below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| So a total of right at 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| I'm not sure how, I'm in favor of giving the foot soldiers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| and I call them third there, the foot soldiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Chief Lyons is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Chief can speak if he wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| He's a man of many words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Him and Richie Beeler will talk your ear off, I guarantee you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| And just so you're all aware, we lost another one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| I'm Bernie Lyons, the chief deputy for Tom Spangler, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| We lost another one today to Sweetwater because it pays more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Speak into the mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| It's really hard to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| We lost one this morning, a patrolman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| who has 14 years' experience to Sweetwater who pays more than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| And we're going to continue to lose them until we pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| I keep, Commissioner, or Chairman Jay made the comment at our previous meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| that we can't get in a bidding war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| We've got to look for other benefits, time off, whatever, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| pay for their schooling, go for education, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| But I'm sure that when we pass and we go to $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| the city of Knoxville is going to go to $41,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| I mean, we can't get in a real bidding war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| So I agree with what the sheriff said the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| that we've got to look for benefits, pay for education, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| But I still think that they need to be our foot soldiers deserve a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| And I don't know how we'll work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| I'll get with Mr. Caldwell sometime this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| and he'll probably tell me no, but I'll still get with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| Thank you, Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Thank you, Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| I want to try to understand the budgeting process and the surplus last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Last year you all submitted a budget with a fully staffed sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Is that where the salary position came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| and is that where the surplus came from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| Yeah, the positions, of course, have to be fully funded at the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| And then because we've had so many vacancies and corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| and patrol and other places, that's where the surplus came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| So this year, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| and I think I'm trying to get at a little bit of what Commissioner Daly was getting at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| this year, again, we are funding the budget at a fully staffed sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| Now, do you anticipate being able to fully staff that sheriff's department this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| Well, at the beginning, no, we'll have vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| July 1st, right now we have, I think, 32 vacancies in corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| and 12 vacancies in patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| So there's a possibility July 1st we will still have quite a few vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| which, of course, does make that surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| But personnel may hire a whole class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| and then those positions are filled for so long until someone quits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| So it's hard to tell just exactly how much by year end you will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| But is that where the majority of your surplus last year came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| was unfulfilled salary positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| That is basically where all of our surplus comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| We very rarely have any surplus in operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| We have 20 different divisions, and they're all, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| they operate on the money that you all fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| Chief Lyons, how do you feel about the chances of filling those positions this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| to getting to fully staffed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| We've been in corrections, we've always been around 30 to 40 short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| I think we're going to continue to be 30 to 40 because it's just difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| for anybody that wants to come into this profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| And the same with the patrol division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| It's just hard to find people that want to come into this profession right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| I'm not sure if you can do this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| but I was just wondering why in previous years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| when we knew we were going to have a surplus due to salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| that we didn't offer some kind of sign-on bonus with a portion of that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| to try to make up some of those shortfalls in numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| I think that's something that we can look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| I will tell you that I had a conversation with the sheriff this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| and Allison, and we talked a lot about they're in the middle of doing a salary study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=760)|
| 0:12:49| so let's get that back and let's see what we can do to try to get our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=769)|
| 0:12:58| to where they need to be on that scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| So the second thing we talked about, too, was I think we can look at educational incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=780)|
| 0:13:08| We can look at maybe a retention bonus or a sign-up bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| I think some of that can maybe even we can use that federal money to help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| from the standpoint of we talked about one-time bonuses for public safety employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| And so I think that's a way that we don't get to the 8%, but we get to a way to help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| and it's not recurring, but at least one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| and it's kind of a bridge to get us to where we could look to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| This isn't about the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Director Caldwell, I have a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Number one, can you tell me, put me on what page the chamber is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=841)|
| 0:14:12| Is it page 35, the Knoxville Area Chamber Partnership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| Probably, and it could be in two spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| And so what you have, you have that there and then you have above it a few lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| but it is also a funding to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| So $540,000 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Do we know how much the city of Knoxville puts in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| I think Doug Lawyer is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| He probably has that answer right off the top of his tongue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=889)|
| 0:14:57| Hey, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| It's a very similar number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| I don't have the exact number, but it's within thousands of that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| Doug, does the city of Knoxville put in money for the development corp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| and the chamber, both at almost the exact same amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| So how development corp is set up is they fund 10% of our total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| because the development corp is basically an entity of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| is what the state tells us at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| Is there any way to get a specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| like a more detailed on the chamber and the development corp budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| Is there any way that I could get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| I mean, we could get the budget as far as we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| What we probably could provide you with is they do quarterly requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| and so we could give you, like, the quarterly request, and that may be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| I mean, the reason I'm asking is because I didn't know if this was at half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| of what we were talking about for six months or what portion of things at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| So whenever I get that, I'll kind of have some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Yeah, and so ultimately what you would see is this is full year funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| and we did keep the development corporation the same in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| trying to anticipate when that changeover occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| and TDC rolls into the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Then we can just change how that funding is allocated to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| We may even keep that same arm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| We just don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| I just had a few questions about it, not budget-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| but specific things that I'd like to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| how policy tips are going to be administered and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| If we could just have some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Yeah, whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Actually, if you don't mind, that's just a random light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Mr. Caldwell, on that same page, just for our education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| the expenditure for the Blount Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| is that for our joint business park in Blount County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| Is that just the utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| Utilities, mowing, operational expenses like that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| The entities, the four that are in there, pay the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| And then are we going to lose a portion of that business park to TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| TDOT would have to make us kind of hold for what they do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| Pellissippi Extension, and so we were trying to have conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| with them to help to see if they could redirect it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| and not do what they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| The last thing I heard was they were not listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| and were going to come into our business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| So they'll have to buy that property from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| and we'll have to rearrange what the plan was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| It's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Are there any more questions for any of our departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| regarding the fiscal 22 budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Chris, if you could, could you get with perhaps Bob Cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| and the retirement department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| and see what the effect of a 3% raise would have on UOP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| and also the STAR asset accumulation plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| I would imagine it would have some effect on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Oh, a STAR would be fairly straightforward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| but we can see the impact that would have on the VAL| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| as it relates to UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210517-budget-public-hearing?start=1112)|
