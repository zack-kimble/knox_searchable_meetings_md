| 0:00:00| So that's why I'm doing that. We're here today to preview the Internet-Based Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| Forum, and I'd like to tell you a little bit about that. I think most people are aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=6)|
| 0:00:10| of the events of the past year or so have brought a great deal of attention to the Open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=10)|
| 0:00:14| Meetings Act or the Sunshine Laws, most commonly called, and what if any communications outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=14)|
| 0:00:20| of public meetings were allowable under the law. Although Knox County may have been at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=20)|
| 0:00:25| the forefront of the debate, the same issues apply universally across the entire state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=25)|
| 0:00:31| Succinctly, how do commissioners effectively represent their districts if they can't talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| to one another except in open public meetings? We are fortunate in Knox County that our legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=35)|
| 0:00:44| delegation in Nashville recognized the problems that a strict interpretation of the Sunshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=44)|
| 0:00:49| Law can present, and they had the vision to put forth one possible solution, which we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| going to show you in a few minutes. I want to personally thank State Representative Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| Dunn, who is here today, and say Senator Randy McNally for sponsoring the legislation, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| made it possible for Knox County to be a pilot project for an Internet-Based Commission Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=64)|
| 0:01:11| In compliance with the legislation, this electronic forum allows communication between county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| commissioners that can be viewed real-time by the public, and that will also be archived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| and available to the public for a period of one year. In accomplishing this, we used open-source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=81)|
| 0:01:31| software, which we modified extensively, but actually cost the taxpayer no money except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=91)|
| 0:01:39| for our time to develop it. This forum will be going live tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=99)|
| 0:01:48| and it can be accessed through the Knox County website at www.knoxcounty.org. With that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| before I turn it over to Tank Strickland for some comments, I'd like to take through and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| show you what it's going to look like. John Gustin from our staff, you're going to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| the bus down there, so I think you'll all see it on your screens in front of you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| As I mentioned, you get to the forum through the Knox County homepage at www.knoxcounty.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| We have placed a button prominently displayed that says Commission Forum over in the right-hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| corner. Citizens, county commissioners, would click on that button, and that will take you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| to the forum. The citizens at this point would be in. They could click on a topic and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| whatever's on there. County commissioners, now posting to this forum, it's restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| to the 19 county commissioners. They would go up to the top where the arrow says Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| County commissioners log in here, and they would click on that. This would take them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| to the login page. We're going to let John be a county commissioner for today, so John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=163)|
| 0:02:52| would log in with his confidential password. He would punch there. If John wanted to post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| a topic, he would go over there. It says New Topic. This is a bulletin board type of forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| It's topic-oriented. He'd click on Topic, and that takes him to the posting page. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| would simply type in whatever topic. In this case, he's trying to set up a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| meeting with a fellow district mate. He would ask in the forum, can you attend this possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| meeting, and so on and so forth. I want to thank John Owens, too, and his staff and law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| department for their guidance and advice for this. We wanted to make sure we didn't break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| any other laws, and so on. John made sure that this does not circumvent public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=209)|
| 0:03:37| putting out proper public notice in a timely fashion, and so on and so forth. He would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| then preview that. If you hit the Preview button, it will show it exactly like it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| in the forum. Then you press Submit to post it. Once you press Submit, it is there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| good. It is very important that the commissioners preview this and make sure that it's exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| the way they want it. This is the way it would look like to the citizens and to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| If you go back to the home page there, that's the way it would look. The topic would look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| on the home page. Right under the topic, you would see that it has the author of the posting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| It has the date and the time of the posting. In this particular example we're using, his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| district mate, maybe a few days later, would look at that. He would log into the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| He would see that there was something that should be or might be of interest to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| since it dealt with his district. He would click on that. He would see that maybe a reply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| was necessitated or suggested. He would click on Post Reply. He would go to the posting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| page and he would post a reply. Again, he would preview it and he would submit it. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| all of a sudden, under that topic, you have two postings. You go back to the home page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| and the home page would show you, again, who was the author, how many replies there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| to that particular posting, how many different commissioners viewed that posting, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| would show you the last commissioner that posted to it and the date and the time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| that posting occurred. That's pretty much it. The last thing, there is a search button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| up on the top also. If you click on that search button, you could search on author or by content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| If it was something like tax freeze or some topic, anywhere in any of the postings, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| would bring up all those particular postings. I want to thank John Gustin, too. John spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| a lot of hours. Once we received the approval from Chancellor Fanzler, John has spent a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| lot of weekends working on this. He's done a very good job making it as user-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| and as professional looking, and I think he's done a good job. With that, I'd like to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| it over to our Chairman Tank Strickland of the County Commission for a few comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| that he may want to make. Thank you, Dick. I made a comment that John was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=363)|
| 0:06:20| a commissioner for a day. Well, he tells us all what to do. He ought to be a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=380)|
| 0:06:28| What you've seen today is we'll provide commissioners a method to communicate with each other about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| important issues before we have our regular scheduled meetings. By using this valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| tool, my fellow commissioners will not only be able to communicate, we'll be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| it in a way that's legal by the courts. Personally, I'd like to thank Representative Dunn for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=407)|
| 0:06:56| his leadership and his brain idea for this. We thank you. It is my continued belief to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=416)|
| 0:07:09| make the meeting of the Knox County Commission as efficient as possible. I'm believing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| this tool will not only facilitate that end, but will keep our constituents well-informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| on what's going on. This tool will also be an excellent insight for Knox County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| to be aware of important issues that would come before this legislative body. Those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| the only comments that I have, and I would like to turn it over to Representative Dunn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| of the Tennessee House of Assembly. Thank you, and I'd like to thank Chairman Tank Strickland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=458)|
| 0:07:50| and the full commission who actually passed a resolution when they heard about this bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| saying we would like to have this. I also need to thank Dick Moran and John and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| whole staff for, first of all, finding a program that was free. I know the taxpayers thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| you for that. And then for putting a lot of time and sweat into making this a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| And also I need to thank Senator Randy McNally, who was the Senate sponsor and shepherded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| it through it. And I'm also going to thank Chairman Ulysses Jones of the state and local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| government committee. No one could really agree on how to proceed on changing open meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| law, so the decision was kind of made everything would just be studied and nothing would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| advanced. But he, I was a bit persistent, I was always polite, and talked to Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| Jones, and he was kind enough as he listened and learned more about this that he said maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| this is a little bit different, this is unique than some of the other issues, and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| able to proceed through there. The way this idea originated, everyone can remember that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| after the lawsuit there was a lot of discussion. A lot of commissioners said, you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| need to be able to discuss, we need to be able to deliberate. If I've got a seatmate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| if I'm sharing a district with someone, we need to be able to talk about what's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| in that district. At the same time, the people were saying, yes, but we need to know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| you're talking about. And so there was sort of this great divide. It reminded me of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| beer commercial where they argued over taste great, less filling, and they kept arguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| And so this idea came about, I have five children and they like to get on the Internet and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| to their friends through instant messaging. And so I was aware that through technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| people could carry on a conversation and someone could see what that conversation was. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| so that's where this idea came from. And obviously a lot of different people helped me as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| moved through the process to make it better and that it would indeed be in such a form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| that people would be aware of what was going on and that these records could be archived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| for a year so people can go back and see what was being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| This technology is a very powerful tool. It's just like a lot of things in life. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| a car is very useful, it's very powerful, but if it's misused then bad things can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| So I do hope that those members, as they use this, remember this and use it in the spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| that it's intended. It needs to be pointed out that while the county commission has had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| foresight to see this as a useful tool, the bill specified all of Knox County. So therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| our school board, city council, planning commissions, anyone who comes under the Open Meetings Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| will be allowed to use this type of technology. Obviously they would have to set up their own site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| and have their own discussions there. But I hope this does make government more effective and efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| and most importantly more transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| And I'm not sure what's next, but at some point you say are there any questions. Are we at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Bill, I have a question. This was a pilot project, correct? Is there a time frame on when this will end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| or that you will need to report back to the General Assembly as to whether it's been successful or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| It's got a sunset provision three years. And obviously if it works well in those first one or two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| we'll get rid of the sunset provision. And I would anticipate that other commissions, city councils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| school boards, they'll start picking up on it. So I see it going forward as opposed to sunsetting one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=684)|
| 0:11:38| I have not done extensive research. Now I haven't heard of anyone in the state of Tennessee doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| because obviously it would have been illegal. In fact, part of the law talked about using technology in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=704)|
| 0:11:52| When it was written, they were referring to like telephones, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| a telephone could not be used to deliberate or discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| And so we had to change some of that legislation that's been there that was put in before we had computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| So in Tennessee, I know for sure no one else is using this or at least not using it legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| And across the nation, I've asked certain people and no one knows of any other government group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| that uses this as part of their sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| Discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=741)|
| 0:12:31| And I've always said that's the first thing you have to do in open means is define those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| I don't think they're very clearly defined, but that's what Chairman Jones is going to work on one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| I think what this allows you to do, that if you have any doubt, go to the chat room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| If you have any doubt whether it's a discussion or a deliberation, just log on, make your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080717onlineforumdemo?start=768)|
