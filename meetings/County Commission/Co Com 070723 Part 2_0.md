| 0:01:32| We'll call for the vote on the original question now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| I've got a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| Let's, you know, Mr. Law Director, you might have to advise me through this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| I think, Commissioner Ballard, did you make a motion to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| So I think we have to have a vote on call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| So if you don't want any more debate on this, then you vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| And you've got to have two-thirds majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| You've got to have 13 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| So we'll start in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| Now, Mr. Law Director, vote yes means you don't want any more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| Vote no means you want to discuss it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=134)|

| 0:02:18| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| With the original question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| the law director said he would find out what has gone on throughout the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| and present that to the ethics committee so they can consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| That's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=153)|

| 0:05:36| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Mr. Chairman, first of all, thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| I'd like to withdraw number 906 at this time and perhaps bring it back later if that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| I make a motion we just go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| I mean, let's just give them the whole ball of wax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| If we're here to give it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| If you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| I was just going to give an opportunity to bring it back later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| given the commission or the ethics panel the opportunity to go ahead and work on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| and then perhaps work on nepotism at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| I make a substitute motion that we hear it today and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Let them do it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| I mean, if we're going to do it, let's get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Same time, November 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Move it to the same time to be back by November 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Second by Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Commissioner Kaywood, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| It's to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| It's to approve the let the ethics policy come up with a nepotism policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| The only change is November 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| It's to approve it and changing the date from October 1st to November 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| Wouldn't this be covered under the 905?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| Well, let's just give it good clarification to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| I mean, I tried to do this a couple months ago and I still am sitting here and I'm thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| I just don't know what to think because I was the bad guy for doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| and we're praising other people for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| So let's just give them the whole ball of wax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| If they come back with a nepotism policy saying that if you have family that works for county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| that you can't serve on commission, does that mean we're going to have to make more appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| Because last time we did that, we got in all kinds of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| I hope they deal with misuse of money, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| The appointments, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| Let the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| He's got a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Just as a point of clarification, the Ethics Committee, as it presently exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| their terms expire at the end of this August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| And so next month, I'm sure it will be before you and for the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| certainly for discussion as well as to who will be named to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| If anyone is to be changed, they will be the ones who will be determining these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| or who will be making these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| Would that be a full committee turnover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Or is this just a couple, two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| It's a full committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| It's a full committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| The full committee rolls over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| But does the mayor's appointments, as far as ours, everybody has to be ratified by the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| The, you're asking me to pull it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:40| Maybe we should start seeing the margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| That's what we need to prove when it comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| And this nepotism policy will be recommendations to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| How can it reach into the trustee's office or the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| and tell those elected officials how to run their office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Because the state legislature said that we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| They have applied it to every elected official, every department of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| They have applied it to utility companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| The state legislature said that this legislation applies that whenever you have a policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| that the policy applies to utility companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| and to every elected official, department, employee of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| And with the city, it would be the same with all city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| So if a department has a nepotism policy in place already, this will override it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| I thought we were talking about our nepotism policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| The state did not address a nepotism policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Now, the state had one that was before the legislature this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| And it was either defeated or withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| But it was, I believe, intended to restrict county commissioners from both serving as an employee of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=592)|
| 0:10:01| and as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Lee Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Not just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Not just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| It was going to be statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| And it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| But if this body comes up with a nepotism policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| will it override what an elected official already has in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=613)|
| 0:10:24| The commission, the Knox County commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| There are some elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| There are some elected officials that have nepotism policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| I know the mayor has a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| And basically what it does is it provides that you can't supervise, you know, a member of your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| And it's a pretty distant relation, I believe, in the mayor's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| What you have asked the ethics committee to do is to recommend a policy to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| the way I understand it, as it applies to Knox County commission, not the other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| Well, if the ethics policy is going to apply to all teachers, county employees, as I said, would this not too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| This is not a requirement of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| And I'll have to look at that and see as to whether this body can then impose a nepotism policy on the other officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:27| Could you impose a nepotism policy on the utility companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| And I think not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| And they are part of the enabling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| We can impose one on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| They are part of the enabling legislation, however, because they are subject to our policy, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| So we'll have to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| We'll try it by voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Put me down for a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Eighteen ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| Resolution 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| This is a resolution requiring Knox County to accurately report Knox County employees' social security earnings records according to law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Motion made by Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Josh Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| This is to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Our law director says that we should never do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| I would move a substitute motion to withdraw this thing on advice of the law department that this is very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| very dangerous and was not drafted by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| It was drafted by an individual and has major,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| major consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| And on his advice, this thing needs to be withdrawn from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| But, remember, we just talked about the citizens having the right to come up here and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| A citizen wrote a letter and asked us to put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| So, any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| I would just quickly say as the author of the motion that sometimes law directors are wrong as bright as they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| and I think he's wrong on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| All in favor of substitute motion to withdraw, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Any other no's besides Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| We're on 9.10 on page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| 9.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| This is a resolution requesting the Knox County District Attorney General to investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| at the appropriate time the circumstances involving Mr. Equitabone and other matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| I guess I need to do committees first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=848)|

| 0:14:26| Motion to approve by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| I couldn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| I think the amendment was to add other individuals, not just putting Ms. Bones on there by herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| Any other person who needs to be investigated, the Attorney General does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=878)|

| 0:14:49| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| I just want to go on record stating that I'm against this resolution because I don't think we need to tell Randy Nichols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| how to do his job or the sheriff, but I think it's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| So Lee Trammell, do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| I need to be told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| Commissioner Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| I agree with Commissioner Strickland, and I'll try a substitute motion to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Second by Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| I guess we've still got some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| I guess I'm wanting some clarification as to what the state comptroller is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| I'm understanding, from what I understand, the state comptroller is looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| The state comptroller will be making recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| and the recommendations the comptroller makes would be to proceed with possible wrongdoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| or prosecution, I guess, is the correct term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=952)|
| 0:16:00| Let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I have had a communication with the state comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| I know our county auditor has had several communications with the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| I intend to meet with the comptroller very soon over the previous audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| and the audit I believe that the mayor has through tomorrow to finalize his response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=978)|
| 0:16:27| The comptroller has not made any recommendations yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| I don't know if the comptroller will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| I intend to have a conversation with the comptroller's office face-to-face to see if they will make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:43| I know that, again, that they have had communications with Mr. Walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:50| and have assisted him with the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| With that said, you know, we're not far enough down the road yet to really comment any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:06| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| I agree with Commissioner Strickland that I think this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| well, actually what I think is Ms. Bone has obviously made some mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| She's paid dearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| And I think it's almost shameful the process that's taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| And I don't think it becomes our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| I feel sorry for Ms. Bone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| We're not just on Ms. Bone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| We're including these other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| But we've got down here at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| We're not voting to send this to them immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| but the public out here wants to see that we're doing something about these charges that seems to be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:55| Now, some of these people have the same as confessed, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| when they start paying and then resigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| Maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| But it's up to us to see that the taxpayers' dollars are protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| And if these people have done wrong, they need to be prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| And we're not talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| We're talking about at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| I think we need to go ahead with this at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| I just want to clarify something that Commissioner Norman said, that Ms. Bones had paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| I think there's some additional things that she hasn't paid back that's come in in credit card statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| after she departed Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| So just to clarify that not everybody's paid back everything they've owed so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| You know, and, Mr. Trammell, you work in law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| How many people are in prison that would gladly pay the money back if they could just get out of being charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| Now, if somebody accidentally charged a glass of wine that might have been appropriate at their previous job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| and it's not appropriate now, you know, that's a situation where simply paying back is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| But if somebody willingly and knowingly charges something on their county credit card that they know is not appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:16| that's theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| That is committing theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| And when they're stealing from Knox County, they're stealing from Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| They're stealing from our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| They're stealing from our libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| And they need to be prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| And I'm not just talking about Ms. Bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| And I'm not sure of the details of her situation and whether criminal intent was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| But I believe that all of the situation with these credit cards needs to be looked into to see if there was criminal intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| on any of these employees' part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| And if there was, they need to be prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| But I don't necessarily think that that needs to be handled in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| I think that what we need to do is get this into another body, either the state comptroller, either the FBI or the TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:08| It needs to be in the hands of some investigative body outside of Knox County to determine who did what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:16| Because no matter what we do here, we're, you know, people are going to accuse us of doing the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| If, you know, people are going to accuse us of trying to cover up for our friends because we're all serving in government together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:33| Or they're going to say, oh, we're just going after our enemies because there are different political factions in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:41| So I think that we, county government, needs to push this into somebody else's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| I think we need to send this to the comptroller, to the FBI, to the TBI, some other body to investigate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| and ask them to prosecute the folks who did something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| Because this, if someone maliciously and knowingly stole from Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| then they've stolen from all of the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| And so I think they need to be prosecuted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| But I think we need to send this to somebody else to do that prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| As I understand the way things work, back to Commissioner Hammond's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| the state comptroller will do an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| That will go to General Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| At that point, General Nichols will review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| He's already said he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| At that point, General Nichols reviews it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| If there's criminal wrongdoing there, he will send it back to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| They will appoint a special prosecutor since we fund some of his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| He does not feel like he can do that, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| I just take a little issue with us trying to tell the Attorney General how to do his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| I don't think we need to tell him nor Sheriff Jones how they need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| And I don't think there's any investigation to be done until the audit is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Well, I'm just going to have to go along with Commissioner Lambert here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| but you've got to realize we can't say this is a mistake when it was just time after time after time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| that they've done these charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| We know that these people have done wrong or they would have not started writing checks after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| How did they know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| If I made a mistake, I don't know it until somebody draws my attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| But they automatically started writing checks just like this is my understanding in what we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| And I'm just all we're doing is saying it's appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Now, the appropriate time may be when the comptroller comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| but we need to be sure that the Attorney General or somebody looks into these facts and get it straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| Now, when, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Can you tell me when the appropriate time is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Personally, right now, I think it's appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| But we're voting to send this to him at the appropriate time to be sure that he follows through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| The only question I have, and this I don't know, I'll just ask Mr. Mayor because it's your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| Is anybody in your office still receiving your auto travel allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:11| I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| I mean, unless I'm missing something somewhere, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Yeah, I think appropriate time is, I mean, there's three phases, and I'm sure everybody knows here, of this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| One is the auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| One is the P-card use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| And the other one is the Knox hospitality count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| So, Mr. Walls, did he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| Oh, I see him now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| How close are you on, you're finished with the auto allowance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| And you're waiting a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| And now we're in the P-cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| And do you have an idea when this one may be finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| No, it's ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Have you started on Knox hospitality yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| Barely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Barely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| So you're running two at once with your limited staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| So the appropriate time, I believe, in this is going to be when these things are back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| We're going to do them one at a time and send the auto allowance down to the comptroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| and I guess that's what we're going to do, send it down and see what the state comptroller says about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| And then the P-cards are going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| And I think that's probably going to be a battle royale right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| because I'm sure there's charges that they feel are appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| and there's going to be charges that we feel aren't appropriate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| and that's for us to duke it out over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| And then the Knox hospitality account, and then that will go down separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| So as I understand it, there's going to be three different appropriate times that these hit the state comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:44| And then once he sends them back to you, do you then make recommendations as to where they go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| I'm not sure what we're going to do at that point right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| We've not gotten to that point, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| Right now what we have is we're waiting on a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| Once we receive that response, we're going to talk to the comptroller about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| see if they have any further recommendations, and then we're going to decide what we need to do from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| And that is only related right now to the travel expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| We haven't gotten, as you say, we haven't gotten to the other issues yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1521)|

| 0:30:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Could you repeat the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Does anybody remember what the amendment was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| Law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| The amendment was by Commissioner Frank Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| And what we have done is we have rewritten this change to incorporate that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| And what it does is this, is you have a five-person personnel board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| And one personnel board member is selected by the elected county officials that are participants in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:29| Currently, we do not have participants that are, you know, county elected official participants who are members of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| Commissioner Luthold wanted to certainly leave it out there to encourage county elected officials to participate in the county plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| instead of having their own personnel plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| And so we wrote this to allow this body, first of all, to make the appointment if there weren't two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:56| at least two elected county officials who could select the fifth member of the personnel board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| If there aren't at least two elected county officials that are participants in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| and that wish to make an appointment to the personnel board, then this commission will make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| If at a future time we have elected county officials, at least two, that are participants in our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:26| then when either a vacancy occurs for that board member's position or at the end of that board member's term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:35| then those elected officials that are participants in the plan will have another opportunity to make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| If they fail to act at that point, then the county commission would again have the authority to make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| That's what it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=1975)|

| 0:35:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| I want to speak briefly in support of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Is Hugh Holden here at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Somebody else may be able to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| I've gone back and looked in the last 20-some years, and I guess one of the reasons I look at this because this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| was a school at one time, Brown Low School, which sits in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| It's now went by there this morning like I have many times in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| And I'm not throwing rocks at anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| I'm making a point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| That building is still sitting empty, and there's nothing that's been done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| I'm wondering if this had been a fact, this ordinance, if this would have ever come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| But logic tells me that it may have reduced the chance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| I just want to urge everyone here to please take careful consideration in this and voting and supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| I would like to amend that to include a conversion policy in these RFPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| If these people don't meet the contract, then that property comes back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| Because the gentleman that we give that RFP to out there, he met none of the obligations that he agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| and he turned around and sold that school for $125,000 profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| So if they can't meet their contract, we need a conversion clause in these things to where it comes back to Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| County like KCDC has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| Mr. Law Director, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Yeah, I mean, what we've done is we've looked at those on a case-by-case basis as to whether that would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2230)|
| 0:37:18| that we would want to do as a body, we would want to do as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| I would be hesitant certainly to recommend that we have that made as part of our policy in every case that we provide for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:32| a conversionary clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| The folks who have dealt with property longer than I've been alive that have advised county government on a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:48| property issues would, I believe, not recommend that we have reversionary clauses that property would come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| It might have liens on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| It might come with all kinds of goodies that we weren't expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| So it's just one of those matters that we might want to look at on a case-by-case basis to see if that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| we would want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| I would be very hesitant to include that as part of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| It may be something we want to discuss every time a property issue comes up as part of the method of sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| and how we want the transfer to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Something maybe that's not what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| I'm not a logger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| But we need something to protect the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| We send these RFPs out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Usually they're buying this property at a reduced price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| And so if we're not going to auction it off, then we need something to protect the citizens of Knox County where if these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| people don't meet their agreements, then it comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| Maybe we need to move our agreements up a little bit faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| We put in there that they cannot acquire any more liens on the property than the one that's first acquired or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| But we need something to protect these citizens out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| It's not right to let people make $125,000 off the taxpayers back out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| And that's what they did on this Brown Low School over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| And it's still sitting over there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| It's sold about three times since the county sent an RFP out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| And it's still just exactly like it was, except in worse condition than when the county sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| I don't know what to do, but I'm going to look for your leadership to do something to protect the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| For instance, in the last sale that this body just approved, we decided not to include a reversionary clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:45| And that's the property over here, the old new Sentinel property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Basically, you know, we didn't want it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| We didn't want to take the chance that it would have liens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| Or perhaps, you know, someone decided to go ahead and start building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| and decided that maybe the deal wasn't as sweet as they thought it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| or they didn't want to follow through with the deal, something to that effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| and might end up costing the taxpayers more money to have a reversionary clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| So it's just something that needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| Could you put it in there as first option, fair option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| We can write a sales contract, certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| so long as you have both sides agreeing to what the terms are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| But we can look at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Commissioner Bolus, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| I just want to reiterate that is that area of 4th and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| It is a beautiful, beautiful neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| And that is a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| That building is Mr. Pinkston was staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| There's what my understanding is some of the restrictions were lost long before I came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| But I'm not sure if this will completely eliminate the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| but hopefully it will reduce the chance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| I hate to see this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| Commissioner Pinkston, did you have a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| Did you get a second on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| I don't know whether I got a second or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Let's put the conversion clause in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| If they didn't fulfill their obligation to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| the property would come back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| But the law director just stressed no on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| So I think that probably we need to go along with his advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| But I'm going to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| I think that any time one of these come up for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| he needs to give us some good advice on whether to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| That's the only kind there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| All I'm looking at is the taxpayers out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| You know, here you had somebody that made $125,000 in the buildings just like it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| And the reason we sold it to him was he was supposed to fulfill an obligation on to redo that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| and make the neighborhood nice over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| And it's in worse shape now than it was when the county owned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| It passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| We have a couple of people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| Rick David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| Oh, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| We've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Ordinance 105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| This is amending section 2-478A of the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| which is ordinance number 0-03-4-101 subsection 1 on 5-2703.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| It passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| We have a couple of people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| The first one, Mr. Rick Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| Mr. Rick Davis here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Rick Davis, if you'll give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Your time is 515.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| My name is Ricky Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| I live at 618 Truesdale Road in Austin, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| The reason I'm here today is because of the lack of ethics of Bill Swann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| I went to court September 28, 2005, trying to get custody of my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| My ex-wife had been physically abusing them, and Swann never did nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| But when I'm trying to introduce evidence and all this tape of which proves she was perjuring herself and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| and all the information, too, Swann states this here, quote, I do not really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| And when the judge don't care, something's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| When kids are physically abused and he neglects physical abuse, I filed a complaint against him against the Board of Judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2632)|
| 0:44:00| My wife made it in court and hit my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| I testified in court of seeing her beat my kid with a closed fist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| and he dismissed the order of protection because he didn't do nothing, because he don't care about the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| And like I say, I filed a complaint with him, the Board of Judiciary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| and I got transcripts where she's hit me and me testifying and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| His response, his statement back to the Board of Judiciary was there's insufficient evidence to issue order of protection for my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:30| She continues to physically abuse my kids, and DGS finally went in and did an investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| and they found, yes, they were being physically abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| And that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| When the judge don't care, something's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| My 10-year-old son threw a knife at his mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| She had been physically abused and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| And I go to court, try to get custody of my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| They didn't come up and take time away from me, from my parenting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| And like I say, he threw a knife at her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| I got evidence to prove every bit of this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| His own son, I got an article out of paper where his son basically won't have anything to do with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| The article said he had a strained relationship with his son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| When a man's son don't have anything to do with him, that shows he ain't no good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| I also have evidence where he was not even paying his court order of child support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| The judge was not paying child support for his own son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Something's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| Also, I've heard allegations that he beat his wife up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| I've been trying to find out where his court papers are, and all I've basically found is they're hidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| Okay, his court papers will prove if he beat his wife up or not because it was filed for domestic violence or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| And this is a judge who's doing stuff to other people and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| And like I say, I have questions about his being incompetent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| He's unethical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| He lied to the Board of Judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| When I filed a complaint with the Board of Judiciary about it, he said that there's insufficient evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| I got transcripts to prove it, and that's lying to the Board of Judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| He's incompetent, unethical, and a liar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| People don't want the people in the Knox County deserve better than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| When my children are being physically abused and no one does anything about it, it's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:25| A child is a product of their environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| When you physically abuse children, that breeds physical violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| Like I say, my son was hitting, kicking his mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| And like I say, he threw a knife at her because of the way he had been treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:47| There are so many things I want to ask, I mean speak about, whatever, I have so little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| I was in court when I'm trying to introduce evidence and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| And before I even got to ask one question, the first thing he said was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| I'm going to cut you off after a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| I was in court for an hour and a half for child custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| The previous case lasted 29 days, but I don't have an hour and a half's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| And then when he, like I say, when he says, I don't really care when you try to introduce evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| I think the people of Knox County deserve better than Judge Swan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| He needs to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| And I asked the county commission to ask the appropriate people to do an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| I got documentation to prove everything I'm saying right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| So, like I say, thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Alonzo Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| Is Alonzo here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Hubert Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Mr. Smith, the time is 520.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Hubert Smith, Peelbox 607, Knoxville, Tennessee 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| I find myself in an uncomfortable position today because generally when I'm here my position is that of a member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:13| media to cover these meetings and not be a part of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| And one thing that we try to do is not make ourselves a part of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| But unfortunately, I was put in this position to have to address you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| And the timing of it is just coincidental, maybe beneficial to me, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| I had asked your staff to put a copy of a letter that I was given on last Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| and I hope that each of you received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| I'm going to read from it verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| It is addressed to me July 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| Reason employment with the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Now, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Most of you probably didn't know that I even worked for the juvenile court clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| because I kept a clear firewall between my job and my politics and what else did I do in terms of working with the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2936)|
| 0:49:05| So what I'm going to say today may be eye-opening to some of you, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| But the letter states this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| Reason employment with clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Dear Hubert, I regret to inform you that effective immediately you are hereby laid off until further notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| The county not only failed to fully fund our salary request but eliminated the funds for your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| You are to leave the premises immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| Your personal effects will be mailed to the above address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| You are not to return to the premises of the Knox County Circuit, civil sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| or juvenile court clerk's offices unless you have business with the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| I'm Hubert Searly, Kathryn F. Quist, clerk of Knox County Circuit, civil sessions, and juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| Now, circumstances surrounding this, what I know and I'll tell you what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=2992)|
| 0:50:00| What I know is I've been employed with the Knox County clerk's office since March of 2001, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| And was employed until last Friday, according to this letter, July 20th, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| It's about a six-year term without interrupted service except for some extended illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| My evaluations have been exemplary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| My work record has been good by all accounts of everybody that worked around me, maybe bar a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| But as you all have said during your meeting, you're always going to find some people that would disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| with you for one reason or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| So I accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Nobody is 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| At the end of the workday on Friday, I was handed this envelope by Charles Edmondson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| who is an employee of Kathryn Quist and told me something to the effect of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| I'm sorry, they didn't fund your salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| I didn't quite get it when he first said something to me because I thought he was referring to the $500 bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3055)|
| 0:51:04| that I think you all mandated during your budget that everybody making under $45,000 a year employed as of June 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| would get the $500 bonus, which I will qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| You may be surprised to know I'm a six-year employee at the clerk's office making less than $25,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| Having said that, I came quickly to understand that he was saying, no, my position was being eliminated because you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:31| the county commission, as you can see in this letter, did not fund their salary request for my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:42| I was pretty much stunned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Because as of June 30th, effective July 1, my salary position was in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| and I worked until July 20th thinking that it was fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Nobody told me anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| That's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Oh, in addition, I was unable to clear anything out of my office, any personal effects, as you can see by the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| They said they would mail them to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| And perp walked me out the door by Knox County Sheriff's deputy as if I'm some criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| That's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| I asked him, well, when did you know about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| He said, oh, this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| I said, well, why didn't you tell me this morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| Well, that's just the way that we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Speaking of I imagine the clerk of the juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| So that's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| I'm here before you today because the way I read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| she puts the onus on you all for saying that you didn't fund her salary request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| My position was in the request as of June 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| and I think that you all funded everything that that office asked for, if not even a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| So I understand that you all don't do anything about employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| and so I'm not asking you to do anything for me necessarily as an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| except the fact that I want to state this and get this on the record because I understand politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3182)|
| 0:53:11| and I can take a punch, but this is one definitely below the belt or any other extremity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| But I'm not going to take it lying down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| Today I'm responding and responding to you because it says you didn't fund my salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| So I look at it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| I guess perhaps I should ask you to fund my salary since she says you didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| or perhaps this was a clerical error and this should have applied to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| I've told you what I know, but I'll tell you what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| What I think is everything that we've read about since July 31st in terms of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| and behaviors has gotten me caught up in an unintended way, at least for me anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| You know, we live in an era now where everybody didn't go to journalism school as I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| and other people did and we have these citizen bloggers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| and everybody else that can do and write whatever they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| And I think in this case that's exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| I wrote some things about someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| and someone thought that I was instrumental in that writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| Well, I'm here to tell you that I was not instrumental in that writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| The person who wrote it is a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| I don't choose my friends based on their politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| and what they write about somebody is no business of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| but unfortunately I believe that I have become a casualty of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| And so I guess that's my primary reason for coming before you today to put it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| Did you not or did you not fund my position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| I think you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Did it take 20 days for this office to discover that my position was not funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| and have they now screwed me out of my $500 bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| So that's pretty much it for me in terms of what I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| If anyone would like to ask me anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| I would be happy to entertain whatever question that you have and tell you what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| My light's been on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| The curious thing to me is the date of this letter, which is I believe July 20th, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| Commissioner Harmon, if you have a copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Yeah, it says July 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| That is a copy of the letter I received on July 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| If one is arguing that your position did not exist with fiscal year 2007, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| then that started July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| Why, you know, why the discrepancy in dates I do not understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| And I think it lends some credence to your questions, if not your speculation, before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| That's why I thank you for putting forth that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| I guess that would be up to the clerk of the juvenile court as to why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| or perhaps some of her competent staff as to why they took them 20 days to determine my position was not funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| if it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| I couldn't answer that question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| But thank you for raising that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| It's an important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Hubert, how many people do your job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| I do it, Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| What I did do for the clerk's office of the juvenile court was I had no contact with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| The juvenile court basically is divided into two sections, delinquent and family service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| Of course, as you know, the clerk's office is basically there to support the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| My job was to process all of the filings that come in on the family service side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| That includes custodies, guardianships, removals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Anything that isn't delinquent falls under the family service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| And as those papers were filed with the court, I would process those papers in a variety of manners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:52| whether they be new, create them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| If they were existing, update them and put them in a status where they could be moved through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| So I worked mostly independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| So you're the only person in that office that does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Now, I do have a counterpart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| I had a counterpart on the delinquent side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| But on the family service side, I was the only person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| Did they get rid of that person on the other side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Did they let the person on the other side go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Because, unfortunately, as I said, this was handed to me, if not 429, it was handed to me at 430 as I was exiting my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:29| And, again, I was escorted out the door by Knox County Sheriff's officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| So I don't know who was remaining because that happened at 430 p.m. on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| And, obviously, today is Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| So that's what has happened in time in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Now, I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Just based upon the letter, if they didn't fund my salary, I'd kind of like to know how they funded the three part-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:53| people that have been employed the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| And the part-time people told me, now this was before I was aware of it, before this happened to me on Friday, that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| told they would be extended throughout their college when they started college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| These were some interns that were hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| And they were told they would be allowed to work as they started in the college in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| So, you know, I can only tell you what I know and also what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| I don't know who was remaining after I was treated in the condition that I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| If I may say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Well, I clearly remember that Kathy Quist came to this body and asked for more money to make her budget 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:37| And we granted her that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| And it didn't come with any layoffs or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| We granted her the money that she requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| Well, I've looked at the budget, Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| I know that you're absolutely correct and I know that my position was included in that salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| May I make one additional statement, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| This is a personal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| I'm a respected member of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| I probably volunteered more time than a lot of people have put forth working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| I'm a leadership NOS for graduate class of 2000, community leadership class of 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| I formally served on the jail inspection committee representing this NOS County Commission before a lot of you were even elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| I volunteered more time here than more of you ever know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| She had no idea what I did and it didn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| But like I said, I clearly separated what I do outside of work and my work because I needed my job more so for the benefits than the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:35| Again, I'm a six-year employee making less than $25,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| A lot less than some people made hired in off the street that didn't know jack about the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| But we put in a supervisory position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| So that's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| And since you all, according to this letter, didn't fund the salary, I guess I'm asking you to either fund the salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| or perhaps this might have been a clerical error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3594)|
| 1:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| If any member of this body believed it was an error of some type that needs to be looked into, what could this body do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:17| Mr. Laudry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| You're welcome to go and talk to Ms. Quist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| Any other remedy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Any other remedy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| That's the first thing that comes to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| You're talking about a constitutional officer of this county that's an independently elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| She apparently has made an employment decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| So it seems the conversation should be directed to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| So this, if I may ask, Mr. Chairman, does this body hold no responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| although she clearly says the salary request was not funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3650)|
| 1:01:01| Hubert, I don't know what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| I mean, I think we funded everything that they asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| We'll stand and take a brief recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| I think about an hour and a half behind on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| But we'll start in about five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| Commissioner Jordan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3680)|

| 1:01:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3682)|

| 1:01:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Commissioner Kate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Commissioner Craig Luftholme?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Commissioner Frank Luftholme?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Commissioner Kay Wood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Commissioner Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:59| Okay, we have 18 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| Here comes Commissioner Lambert now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| We've got 19 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| Commissioner Lambert, did you want the floor before we had recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| Okay, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| I hope that everyone on this committee will look at the Hall of Shopper today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| Mike Arms has been accused by Herb Moncier has gotten a hold of personal and sensitive information on Tim Hutchins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:38| When asked how he acquired that information, he says that he acquired that information from Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:46| I had hoped that Mike Arms would have still been here, and he knew I wanted to ask these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:53| I want to know how Herb Moncier got a hold of this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| We're talking bank account information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| We're talking about Social Security numbers and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| Guys, this is extremely serious in this day and age with identity theft and things the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| And this is about the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Of course, I know the first two times Mr. Arms was accused by Mr. Harbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| and I know that his integrity is questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| But this is the third time that Mr. Arms has been accused of getting personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| and confidential information of someone out into the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| And I just think we really need to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| And I hope that everyone will read this article, and I'm sure that you'll have the same questions that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| But what my fear is, I mean, I'm an elected official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| and I understand I don't have very much in the way of privacy, but other employees of Knox County do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| And I'm just afraid that at some point, if there continues to be leaks of personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| and confidential information, that it's going to get Knox County sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| And I think that Knox County has a lot better things to do with the taxpayers' money than to pay lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| So I think that this needs to be addressed, and we really need to figure out what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| And we need to put some measures in place to protect the privacy of the folks that work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| Commissioner, I'd like to ask the law director something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Would anything like that release any personal information on anybody that works for the county government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| Shouldn't that go through the law department first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| Anytime that an elected official or an employee of a county receives a subpoena for records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:46| they should consider that certainly a legal affair of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| The county law director conducts all the legal affairs of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| It should come through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| There's a number of reasons for that, first of all, what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| But secondly, we're aware of all the lawsuits that are filed against Knox County, lawsuits where we are participants or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:08| And this happened to be a circumstance where it was a lawsuit connected with a local attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:17| We've had a number of lawsuits by this local attorney over the years, 75 within the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:24| And in a number of those lawsuits, he has asked for this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| What we do whenever we receive the subpoena is address it in the proper way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| and that may be to turn over the information, turn over the information after it's been redacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:44| In this instance, this attorney was not entitled to the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| We filed motions to quash the subpoena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| We were in a hearing with a judge arguing that point when this attorney made known that these records had been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3952)|
| 1:06:06| that we would be surprised to learn that these records, that he had already received these records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| We were surprised to learn that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| And we have dealt with it from that point accordingly, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| And certainly Mr. Arms, I'm sure, understands now that he should go through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:31| And that was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| I think possibly that this lawyer broke ethics there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| I think he should have known better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| I think maybe we need to draft a letter and send it to the Bar Association on him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| and need to have Mike Arms to come down to the Intergovernmental Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| and the Finance Committee next month and explain why he's done these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| Well, the attorney was ordered by the judge, in fact, to not review, to not copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:07| and to return those documents to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| And he returned the documents to our office just before he was required to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:19| I still think we need to send something to the Bar Association questioning his ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| and asking them to look at him if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| I think Mike Arms should have to come down and explain to this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| and the first chance he has to the whole committee would be at the Intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| and Finance Committees, but I think he needs to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| and explain why he's done these things because he's in a position where he should know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| And if he don't know, he needs to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| You know, one thing that really has me concerned, if I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| Mike Arms has a bad ---- and I wish he was here and I did tell him that I was going to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| And he had a meeting that he had to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| But his background, supposedly, is in human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| And you would think that a person with a background in human resources would know about these type of privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4087)|
| 1:08:15| protection acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| And it just seems like, and again, this is the third time that there's been an accusation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| and the second time that it's been reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| I mean, we know for a fact that Chad Tindall's e-mails were received by Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| He told me that himself, never has denied that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| You know, he did say that he didn't ask for them, but he still received the e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| And he did read the private e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| And he told me personally that he had read the e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| You know, and that was four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| And then when Mr. Harbor had his expose in the shopper, he said that he had went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4132)|
| 1:09:02| and got medical records from two talk show hosts from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:10| Now, that was never proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| And, you know, so we don't know whether that's a fact or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| But still, this is the third time that there's been allegations about this type of private information being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4156)|
| 1:09:24| distributed by Mr. Arms, and it's the second time that we've known it to be a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| Because, I mean, if the law director received these papers back when the judge ordered them to be returned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:39| then we know that somehow he got them in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| And I think this draws serious, serious questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| And I really think that we need to be questioning Mr. Arms about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| because someone with a background in human resources should know about Privacy Protection Acts on employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4193)|
| 1:10:01| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| I want to address the zoning issue if we're through with zoning agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| It's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| Are you coming back to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Are you talking about zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| I want to talk about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| I want to get to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Let Mr. Cate go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| Are you going to move something up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| If I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Well, it's your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| I'm hoping that you're alluding to the same one as I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| but I would like to go ahead and hear if that would be all right by the commission, 6-0-07-RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4228)|
| 1:10:37| the zoning appeal by Wendy Lattimore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| It has to deal with the property located on Middlebrook Pike at the end of Roderick Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4240)|
| 1:10:48| There's a lot of people out here that have been in the audience that have come just for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| And if maybe we could move this up since we're running so far behind and let them go on home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| If we have no objections from commissioners, we'll move it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| Under rezoning appeals, appeal by Wendy Lattimore, owner of MPC Denali,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| rezoning from RA Low Density Residential to OA Office Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| property located on the southeast side of Middlebrook Pike, northeast side of Rockridge Road in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:20| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Is there or I understand there's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| MPC report first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| You all can have a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| MPC report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| This is a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| This was a request to rezone a piece of property approximately a third of an acre in Commission District 5 from RA Low Density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:53| Residential to OA Office Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| The Planning Commission heard this at their June meeting and voted nine to five to deny that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4316)|
| 1:12:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| Do you need a motion, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Who wants to go first, opposition or the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| My name is David Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| I'm an attorney and I've been hired by the Lattimores to help assist them in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| Sir, if you can speak into the mic, we're having a hard time hearing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| I'm not well known for not being heard very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| My name is David Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| I'm an attorney and I've been hired by the Lattimores and you've already seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| Sir, before you start, we need your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Home or business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| 1810 Merchant Drive, suit one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4374)|
| 1:12:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| The Lattimores have asked me to assist them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| And if you take a look, there's a brochure that's been placed on each of your desks before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| which helps you to understand exactly what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| The MPC staff recommendation was to approve this rezoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| While the homeowners of the association have some concerns, we need to address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| My clients are seeking to have a mortgage business operate out of this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| Now, if you look at this map, there's been some things colored in yellow, one in blue, and one in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| The blue is the piece of property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| It's on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| The corner of the house is within 22 feet of the edge of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| The traffic there is extremely dense and heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| It's commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| It is ludicrous to think that any family member is going to want to put small children within 22 feet of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:57| That house, although zoned residential, is not truly residential at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| And the appropriate buffer between residential property and true commercial is Office Park, which they've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:12| In 2005, I've attached to you for your own personal review the 2005 minutes of the MPC meeting where an earlier owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4452)|
| 1:14:22| of the property attempted to rezone this same property to C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| Now, it is not being sought for OB today, just OA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| There's no intent to tear down and rebuild, not on a one-third acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| But the Homeowners Association in 2005, Ms. Sue Meier, the same president that's going to be probably speaking behind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:48| said at page 26 of the minutes, third page of your handout, we do not object to the piece on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:56| The entire objection was centered on the piece of property found at lot 36, which is in red on all of your handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4496)|
| 1:15:07| Since that time, a house is being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| The owner of that house agrees with the Lattimore's that he would like to see that piece of property turned into this use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:20| because he knows what will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| The pieces of property that you see in yellow on that handout, the ones to the left of the intersection are all owned by the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Those used to be residences that were houses that were torn down in the process of widening Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| Unless the government decides to sell it at some point in time in the future, it's highly unlikely that the state is going to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:47| with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| The other two remaining pieces of property are actually unbuildable, and that's because they drop down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| and are actually part of the water drainage system in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| It never had houses on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| If this house is the only unit that is being requested for change, the earlier request of 2005 included additional lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:15| It's probably overbroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| I understand why the Homeowners Association may have been extremely concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| The association in the very next page restated that they were not against development of those lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:30| but we're against the one lot we feel should remain in our subdivision, lot 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| That lot right now is being turned into a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| That home is nearing completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| That lot owner supports the Lattimore's effort to turn this into office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| The Lattimore's did the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| They went and checked the land records on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| They checked the prior history of what was the Homeowners Association position in the prior zoning attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| They relied on the homeowners' previous representations of what they would accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:13| In 2005, they said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| There's no reason given for why they would say no today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| It would be arbitrary for this board to fail to follow the staff recommendation of the original MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:31| and, more importantly, the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| They reviewed the sector plan, and guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| It also would have this piece of property become business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| As an appropriate buffer to a residential neighborhood, they plan on putting up a vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:53| and also a privacy fence to improve that block to any potential concerns of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4673)|
| 1:18:02| But we did take the time over this past weekend to go inside that neighborhood to see how their concerns of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:11| expanding in the area actually are applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| Unfortunately, it appears there's 40-something businesses, according to the business licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| operating within the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Several of those businesses operate, one of them, within three houses of the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| That one, in fact, is Time Savers Lawn Management, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| And you can see all their equipment there on the other side of their privacy fence, and they pull it out on a routine basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| There's parking yellow school buses and other problems within the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| So now I understand why the concern over office park for this one lot that only has access on Middlebrook Pike for entrance and exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4730)|
| 1:19:02| My clients are appropriate owners seeking to have a small business that they can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| and expand their existing business but use this property so that they can have handicap accessible business opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| Right now, they're in a location that does not have that handicap accessible business opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| And it is appropriate for this body to approve their request for rezoning because it is appropriate based on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4761)|
| 1:19:31| It's appropriate based on the agreement of the actual neighbor that will be directly affected by the failure to properly maintain this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4771)|
| 1:19:39| Because this house is going to do one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| It's either going to be appropriate, continuous business opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| but it will not be a residence anymore because 22 feet is just not far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| You say that there are already businesses operating within this neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| There is approximately 48 licenses that I identified on Saturday morning going through the business records of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:11| They're available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| And then when you go and drive by the various residences to confirm or not confirm whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| or not those businesses are simply operating as a mailing address or whether they are existing businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| you discover that there are some businesses that appear to be actually operating out of those homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| And then you also discover other, like the school bus issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| Those are not actually licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| So I couldn't address why they can park multiple school buses on a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Are these businesses, did you check the zoning to see if they had a home occupancy variance on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| I didn't find any home occupancy variance on the available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| So as far as the 40-something licenses that exist in the records of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4854)|
| 1:21:03| if there's a zoning variance that's available there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| then certainly that would go towards, not away from, business being approved in an appropriate method, which is office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4866)|
| 1:21:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Could you make those, that list available to Bruce Weitrich so that he can go out and check to see if these folks are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:27| you know, or have a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| It's actually extremely simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| All you have to do is check the land records inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| They're immediately available online to Knox County records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| All you have to do is go by street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Mr. Donaldson, you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| Home occupations are a use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| We do have standards that they have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| So people could, within the zoning code, have a home occupation as long as they meet those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4912)|
| 1:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| What I'm worried that may be happening here, and I've seen it happen before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| is you'll have some illegitimate businesses that don't have their home occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| and they'll get into a neighborhood and irritate a neighborhood about businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| And then someone like this applicant who is doing the right thing and getting the proper zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| then they've got kind of a bad feeling toward business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| And I was just wondering if there might have been some of this going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| The school bus example is actually within approximately four houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| three or four houses of the Middlebrook Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| And during the fall would obviously be easily viewed from my client's residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4956)|
| 1:22:44| or house that they have purchased for this business practice, for their business practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| But you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| And so, therefore, it was open and obvious when I was driving through the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| And if you would like, we do have some copies available of some of our research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| but we didn't do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Certainly, there are some businesses that persons could operate out of a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| The point is that my clients are seeking to operate a very low traffic business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4990)|
| 1:23:19| This is a mortgage business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| Ninety-five percent of their work is done online and over the telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| The only time people come to their business, generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| is either to fill out initial paperwork or final closings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| And final closings occur at people's homes, in addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| So it is not the kind of situation where you would have significant traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| In fact, some of these homes, we saw as many as six cars parked at it on a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| Well, that's obviously normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| But that doesn't mean that this one business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| who would have approximately the same number of cars, is somehow offensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| if that's a standard practice within the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| And the house I'm speaking of is the president of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| That's what we observed on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Mr. Hamilton, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| The red, is that lot number 36?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| That lot generated all of the resistance in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| and that's why I attached the minutes of the MPC hearing of 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| because my clients actually relied upon it when they decided to buy the lot on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| The representation is clearly made by the president of the Crestwood Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5068)|
| 1:24:35| that they were not adverse to that lot being turned into some form of appropriate activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| And you said everything in yellow is government owned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| All of it to the left is owned by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| I confirmed that personally on Saturday with the land records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| And then to the right, those are unbuildable two lots, which are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| I physically reviewed them, and they dropped down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| and they're actually owned by the owner immediately adjacent to my client on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5099)|
| 1:25:08| He was the prior owner, and, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| he did try to obtain a much larger variance or OB for all of the lots in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5110)|
| 1:25:18| And this does not go as far as the original request in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| And to the east of the applicant's property, what is that zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| It looks like there's two buildings on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| That's an R, and that's a detached garage and a new house that the state of Tennessee funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:38| when they tore down that gentleman's original house as part of the expansion of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| So that is residential there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| What did the neighborhood say that they did not mind having?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| And is this what they're planning on now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| I'll point you to page 26 of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| It's actually page three of the handout of 2005 minutes of the MPC of September 8, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| And Ms. Sue Mayer of 8824 Farmington Drive, the president of Crestwood Hills Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5173)|
| 1:26:21| was opposed at that time because there is a lot 36 that is actually in our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5181)|
| 1:26:29| It continues, we do not want our subdivision to go commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| And then specifically as to this lot, it says, we do not object to the piece on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| And I've actually highlighted that in all of your handouts so that you can see that for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| I am quoting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| I am not misstating her words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| She continues, and you can see this on the next page when they have an opportunity, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| for her to look at this one more time, giving her a second bite at the apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| And she says, it is not that we're against development, we are against that one lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| which again refers to lot 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| My client did the right thing and reviewed the minutes, reviewed the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5229)|
| 1:27:16| took a look at the physical location of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| It is an appropriate office park rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5239)|
| 1:27:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| Opposition, the time is 616.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| If you'll give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| We'll give them a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| I am Sue Maurer, 8824 Farmington Drive, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| I am president of Crestwood Hills Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| And I would like to address some of the things that were just said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| First of all, there are people in our subdivision that have home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| A lot of people, believe it or not, have their business address as their residence in Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| I know what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| But they do not operate the business out of their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| In answer to the school bus, yes, Mr. Sparks, who is here today, has had a school bus there ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| since the subdivision was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| He's been in the bus business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| He has one bus and one handicap bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| And it is not offensive to the neighbors because it's way up in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| Now on with what I have to say to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| This piece of property has been denied by MPC in 205 and again on June 14th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5307)|
| 1:28:35| Reason being, it is in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| This would be a domino effect on Middlebrook Pike as property from Roderick Road to Shannondale Nursing Home on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| side and the other side from West Park Baptist Church to Piney Church Road is all residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| except Middlebrook Pike is now zoned with a Weigels and a Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| Now those two locations were already zoned before Middlebrook Pike became a scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5336)|
| 1:29:03| which happened on April 16th in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| We do not want this to become another Kingston Pike or a Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| The scenic highway has certain restrictions for zoning as well as sign setbacks and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| If this is approved, it would be spot zoning, a perfect spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| The property, when sold, was listed as residential, and these people bought it at a residential price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| knowing it was cheaper than office or commercial real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| Mrs. Lattimore's mother bought the house and did a quick claim deed to her daughter and son-in-law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| and this is public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| They have already gutted the inside of the house for storehouse mortgage before getting their rezoning approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| We request that this be denied today, and I thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| And we have over 300 partitions that we would like to hand in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| And I hope you will listen to the rest of our people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5402)|
| 1:30:12| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| My name is Ed Hester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| I've lived at 1120 Roderick Road for over 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| And there are many reasons to deny this appeal, and I'd like to give you the most important ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| Mr. McCurry has a layout of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| And as he brings it up, I would like to tell you an old saying, you can't put a square peg in a round hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:36| Now, when you look at the map, the MPC map and the photos attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| you will see that this precisely describes this situation for the requested property rezone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| which will now be referred to as RPR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| As you see on the red square, this sits at the front of our subdivision of Crestwood Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5451)|
| 1:30:59| and it is surrounded by a sea of residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| From the residential homes to the right all the way up to Fox Lawness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| behind the property requesting the rezone, as far as the eye can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| As a matter of fact, Crestwood Hills is one of the largest subdivisions in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| If this appeal is granted, many of these residents whose lots and property touches Middlebrook Pike lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:29| all the way to Fox Lawness will be greatly impacted by what will very soon to follow called the domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5489)|
| 1:31:40| So we're not talking about just one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| We're talking about all of those houses along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| They're waiting for just one to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| It is not fair for the residents of Crestwood Hills, whose lots are impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:55| to have to spend money to buy a buffer zone of trees or fences or whatever in order to be able to enjoy their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5515)|
| 1:32:04| and not have to look at paved parking lots and office buildings within a few yards of their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5524)|
| 1:32:12| So, once again, like a square peg does not fit in a round hole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| it just doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| As Mr. McCurry distributes to you this list, I'd like you to consider this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5540)|
| 1:32:29| Why here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| Why Crestwood Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| I call your attention that within one mile of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| there's no less than 13 similar-sized mortgage companies residing in office-zoned space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5556)|
| 1:32:44| Now, I know this to be true because I made sales calls in most of these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| I also looked it up in the real yellow pages and found and counted those, and I made a documentation of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| In addition, there are other office plazas that the applicants could have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| they would love to have had them as a tenant had they looked a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:08| As our president said, that this property, if they had researched the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:15| they would have found that this property has been denied rezoning in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5595)|
| 1:33:22| So we submit, commissioners, that as an existing business wishing to relocate from Powell to West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5602)|
| 1:33:31| would have plenty of choice locations all along Middlebrook Pike and, indeed, in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:38| without disrupting the established neighborhood of Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| Then the question again is arising, why here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| Again, we don't know this for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| but it is very possible that this particular site was selected so it could be bought at residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| and to avoid the commercial and the office zone space, which carries a much higher price tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5637)|
| 1:34:05| Once again, the question has to be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| Like a square pig in a round hole, it just doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| We've all heard the saying, surely, things are not always as they seem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| And here's what I mean by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| As our president has stated, there is only one commercial property on our side of Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| all the way from Roderick Road to Shenandoah Nursing Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| And that's a Weigel's convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| We believe and we have some understanding from past statements that have been made in hearings such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| that there is a concerted effort to keep Middlebrook Pike from becoming another Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| In summary, we are confident when you weigh all the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| and consider it that this distinguished body will come to the same conclusion that the MPC reached in 2005 and 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5692)|
| 1:35:01| And that is, like a square pig in a round hole, it just doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| I thank you for your time and your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| And we, as residents of Crestwood Hills, urge you to deny this appeal and keep this property residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5707)|
| 1:35:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:23| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| Yes, I'd like to know who just distributed this piece of paper here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| You did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| Sir, what's the relevance of how many mortgage companies are in close proximity to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| Well, Commissioner Lambert, I stated earlier that within one square, one mile of this property, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| there are plenty of other choices they could have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| That's the relevance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Well, it looked to me like you were saying that we should regulate how many businesses of a certain nature enter a certain area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:58| And I just wanted to make sure that was not your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| Well, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Did I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| I'd be pleased to explain anything else that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| No, that's --I just wanted to make sure you weren't going to suggest that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| limit based on how many are in an area because that's what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| Well, let me just repeat what I said, that there are within one mile 13 similar sized mortgage companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:22| And here's the point of that, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| That was to show that there were other choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| Yes, they are office zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| They are not residential zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| And we feel very strongly as our community that those types of businesses belong in an office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5792)|
| 1:36:40| or certainly in an office zoned property where there is not residential as far as the eye can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5800)|
| 1:36:48| We're worried about the domino effect because we have people that have invested all of their life into this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5808)|
| 1:36:56| That's the reason I wanted you to see that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Well, it just looked to me like you were suggesting that we put quotas on business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| And I was going to remind you this is America, not Russia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| Well, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| I thank you for that question, and I'm glad I was able to clear it up for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| The applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| Are you the applicant or are you opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| I'm employed by Storehouse Mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Well, hang on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| You've got to give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| And now you're on rebuttal, so you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| I'm Tina Brogdon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| My address is 5612 Glenland Drive, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| I'm a resident of Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| I'm an employee of Storehouse Mortgage, have been for a year, a member of the Powell Business Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| Storehouse Mortgage has been nothing but an asset to Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| If you saw the Powell Post this week, you would see they wrote a fabulous article about Storehouse Mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| about the asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| We are a Christian outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| We are there to hurt, not harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| We are there to help people who may have a problem qualifying for a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| We have a low amount of traffic coming in and out, as was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| We may see one to two customers in our parking lot in our building in a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| When we talk about the domino effect, we talked about to the east is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| Let's look to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| To the west, everything is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| We have a wedding planning and a wedding party establishment that backs up to 13 pieces of property in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:29| which they have parties and have outdoor events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| We will be gone by 5 o'clock for the most part every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| We are not asking to tear that building down as it seems to appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| or totally change the exterior of that property at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| That property will remain as a home on all parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| If you drive by there, you'd never know that that was a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| It will remain just as it is, other than there will be major upkeep with the property, with the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5932)|
| 1:38:59| When you walk out that front door, you're so close to the road that there's no way anyone would want to walk out that door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| It's their front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| We have six, seven, maybe maximum cars in our parking lot at one time, never more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:13| And also, this piece of property is not even considered a part of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5953)|
| 1:39:18| If you look at the lots, this is not even considered a part of Crestwood subdivision, if you want to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:25| A third of our employees live in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| They worship in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| Their children go to school in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| I've been educating Ms. Maurer's grandchildren at Cedar Bluff Middle School for several years, lovely children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5971)|
| 1:39:38| We're not there to come in and tear that down and build this huge complex, which some of the neighbors have been told were there to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5978)|
| 1:39:45| We are going to keep that appearance-wise as if it were a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| The interior will be set up as offices, individual offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| But 95 to almost 100 percent of our work is either internet or by phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| So it's not like we're going to have a high amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| But, like I said, to the west, almost everything on that side of the road to the west is already zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:11| And so that's why I just want to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| This is we are a quiet establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| We're not there to disrupt the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| We're there to make that an investment in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Kay, the opposition, you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| Yes, in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| First of all, if this is zoned from residential to OA, office, whatever, it is going to change all the zoning there in Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:39| which means that all these people, all from Crestwood Hills all the way down to including West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| can all be involved in their property from their neighbors going commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| This is something that is known as spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| This is something that is not healthy for a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| It's not up to people to make a decision whether it's going to be a neighborhood or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| This is not something that fits into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| This property to the left is property that would never be built on because it has the sinkholes in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:13| and it has a drainage problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| But all the way down from this corner property all the way down to Shannondale is solid with residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6075)|
| 1:41:22| And on the other side, the same way, we do not want this zoning to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| West Hills is behind us, against it, and so is the condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| And I appreciate your help and hope that you will realize if this is changed what it will do to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| It will be changing the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| It will be a domino effect and there will be a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| As far as the sector plan, the sector plan is not a solid thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| It can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| That does not mean that it's going to remain the way it is right now or that it has to remain that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| So I appreciate you looking into this and we appreciate your consideration of denying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Okay, fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| I'd like to make a motion to approve and affirm MPC's denial of the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:11| So I vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| I would uphold the denial by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Second by Commissioner Pinkham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| I make the substitute motion that we allow this, that we approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:32| Did you make the motion to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| I made a motion to the affirmative to uphold the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| So a yes vote would mean that the rezoning has been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Then I make the counter motion, the substitute motion that we allow this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| I make the counter motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| You accomplished the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| So, I mean, you can vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| You accomplished the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| If I vote no, I accomplished the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| Well, no, then you'd have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Then we'd have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| If you wish to make that, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| I'll make the substitute motion that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| You're saying you want to uphold the appeal, Lumpy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| No, he wants to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| I want to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Is there a second for his motion, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| Does he have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| Seconded by Mr. Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| I'd like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| I'm very familiar with the mortgage industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| I have a friend that works for a mortgage company, a really close friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| It's not a high traffic industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| They take their applications by phone, usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| Occasionally they'll have someone drop by, and usually the closing is done at either the realtor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6235)|
| 1:44:03| or at the home that's being sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| You know, I would imagine that this is probably going to have a lot less traffic than some of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| in this neighborhood, and I'm also familiar with this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| They have been great neighbors and pals, and I sure hope they're not moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| I hope they have their they continue to maintain their office and pal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| and that's why I'm encouraging everyone to vote for this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| I have a question of the applicant or Mr. Hamilton, either one or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6269)|
| 1:44:42| I'm Brian Latimore, owner of Storehouse Mortgage, 1717 Depot Street, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| Brian, we're looking at these, at the things that were sent out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| I'm looking at the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| I'm looking straight on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| If I look up to the right, that's over in the yellow, the state owns what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| There's one, two, three, four, looks like five lots that they own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| Are there any houses on those right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| Is that just for line of sight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| What's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| From what I understand, when the road was widened, those houses were demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| and therefore never built, so built back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| So it is vacant lots at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| What would be MPC, what would be built back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| Would they put homes or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| The property is currently zoned RA, so they would have to develop it under those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| Then you still go back and look at the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| You're on the left-hand side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| Those two little houses are attached to the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| Is that a home or what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| It is a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| And the owner, we have spoken with him, and he is not in opposition to us having our company there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| I think you have a letter to that effect on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| Then the next two on the left of that, the state owns those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| He owns those two also, which those are unbuildable lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| Here's what I'm looking at with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| Coming here, I was going to vote with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| But when I come and find that two years ago they won't, you know, they don't they would approve this corner lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6368)|
| 1:46:16| if it would just stay a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| And now today they're changing their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| And the person that wants to do this, you're going to put a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| Where's your driveway or your cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| Are they going to be facing Middlebrook Pike or are they going to be the inner from the side road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| Where will they come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| We will be coming off of Middlebrook Pike, and we are not asking, nor will we ask for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| a cut onto Roderick, which would put traffic into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| You know, I'm looking at that your immediate neighbors have no problem with that, with you building that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| And, you know, like I say, I was coming and I was going to vote with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| But I think you've done your homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| I have a question for Mr. Lattimore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Signage on your house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| What do you have in mind for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| It is with me standing here with an arm out four by eight sign that hangs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| It will not be lit, no lights on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| So that is in compliance with the scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| Sue, Sue Maurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| On the map there, that was taken by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| Is that not basically a retention basin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| That is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| There are no longer lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| They were taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| And that is a retention basin for the drainage off of Middleport Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| And Knox County has to come out periodically and clean that drain out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| No, there can't be any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| It's owned by the state of Tennessee, and they use it for drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| So to say that those are lots that are going to be built on, no, the state took them for drainage purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6475)|
| 1:48:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| For that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:04| And I urge fellow commissioners to vote no to substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| The other thing that I would like to mention, when it was discussed in 205 and I was quoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| I have to tell you that that lot where this new house is built on Roderick was part of a house that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6495)|
| 1:48:22| Lattimore's want to have for their mortgage business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| That was the reason that we were concerned at that particular time about that particular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6504)|
| 1:48:30| Now we have two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| We have a man by the name of Terry Ray that was approached by these people after he had come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:39| and asked us to protect him from having any zoning change up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| They have gone to him and asked him to please support him, which he is supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| That's his privilege to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| However, at the original time in 205, this was two separate pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| I mean, it was one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| Today it is two separate properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| One is a lot where this Terry Ray has built a new home on Roderick, and the other piece where the Lattimore's want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6540)|
| 1:49:08| to build or have their businesses already built and it's on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| I hope that clarifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| Can I say one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Am I allowed to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| Not really, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| I'll make it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| We're all assuming that the mortgage company will be there for some long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| We don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| And the next thing that comes there might be far more intrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| Once you start this process and you break a rezoning of residential all the way to Fox Lawn, it's going to fall like dominoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:43| That's what we're trying to protect because it is not separated from our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| It is adjacent to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| Every lot on Middlebrook Pike touches Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| And as a consequence, commissioners, one who owns that property then has to spend money to try to buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6598)|
| 1:50:08| Mr. Lattimore has already made a deal with Mr. Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| That's just great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| That's free enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Do whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| That does not ensure that what will happen all the way down Middlebrook, I mean, down Middlebrook Pike toward Fox Lawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:25| And I'm affected by the person who has that garage and the home next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6625)|
| 1:50:33| If that goes commercial or if that goes office, then I'm going to see parking lots over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6633)|
| 1:50:40| Same way with Mr. Sherrill and all the way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| Now, that's the reason that we, you know, if it's an existing house, an existing, I mean, a mortgage company, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:52| But there's no assurance that that's going to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| And like my president said, this sector plan is absolutely not set in stone or concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6655)|
| 1:51:03| It is malleable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| It is changing constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| And I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| Do I understand you correctly that you're really okay with this mortgage, that what you're really afraid of is that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:17| going to start a domino effect and cause other things to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| Well, sir, I am not okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| Let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| Because you break the zone once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| It is just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| Yeah, but what I'm saying is if we can break the zone, if we can do this for this mortgage company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| but not rezone the other properties, would you be okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| Because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| See, Commissioner Lambert, there's absolutely no way, absolutely no way that you can guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:48| Oh, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| I can't guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| But what I'm getting at is it doesn't sound like you're as opposed to this mortgage company as that you're afraid of what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6710)|
| 1:51:56| going to happen on down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| And on a legislative body like this, we have to view these things one parcel at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6718)|
| 1:52:04| and not deny this man his property rights because of what his neighbors might do two or three years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Well, that's a great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| I'm glad you brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| But, yes, I am very opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| I was opposed to it in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| Because it is two lots from my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| And right now, it's a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| It will not be a house forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| It will become something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| And it will also soon have a paved parking lot with nine cars back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| And that's the kind of thing we're talking about all the way down Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| I mean, yeah, Middlebrook Pike, all the way to Fox Lawns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| Because the domino effect will soon follow once one is rezoned, all of them, including the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6758)|
| 1:52:45| All of them will have to come through this body, and they'll have to present plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| The precedent would have been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| You would have a precedent that would be easily shown to the commissioners that that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| So, again, I want to make it very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| No, I am not okay with this property or mortgage, insurance, any of that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:09| because it's just a matter of time before parking lots and all this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6789)|
| 1:53:15| But we do not think that a residential area like Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| Well, I mean, mind you, this is you call it a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| But when I look at it on a map, I see a four-lane divided highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| What you see, if you will look back this side of it, all the way from Roderick Road to Fox Lawns, you see residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6809)|
| 1:53:36| You do not see commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| I don't agree with you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| You do see it on the other side, and you see it coming from Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| But that is the cutoff point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| And just may I say once again, like our president said, the sector plan is not set in concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6825)|
| 1:53:54| And just because it shows it as a possibility, there's no way that one can interpret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| So all we're asking you to do is look at it from the viewpoint of the neighbors, the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| and what this will cause, the ripple effect, the domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| Just a moment, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| I need to ask you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| This lot next to that, where it looks like it's got two dwellings on it, that's Mr. Ray's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| Is that a house and a garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| No, there's no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| I don't know the gentleman's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| But what's the lot number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| It doesn't have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6866)|
| 1:54:32| It would be, yeah, go ahead, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| I'm Mike Sherrill at 1112 Roderick Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| If you're looking at your map, I'm lot number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| What it basically boils down to is the lot that the Rays have is lot 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6881)|
| 1:54:50| It shows a little tiny building there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| That's a red barn that Mr. Ray has torn down since he's built the new house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| And then Ed is lot 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| I'm 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| And then, of course, if you look up to the north of that, it's lot three up there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| where there's a detached garage and the current home there that backs up to Ed's lot and to mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6906)|
| 1:55:12| Well, what I'm getting to, this blue lot there now is Mr. Lattimore's lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| Is that not correct on this piece of paper you've given us here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| Well, we didn't give you that piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| I'd be glad to come up there and look at it and tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Come here and look at it just a moment if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| Blue lot right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| Who owns this property right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| Who's this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| The why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| But who owns this property right here on Middlebrook Pine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6939)|
| 1:55:45| Shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| Is his name Shade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| Shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| Chris Shade owns the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| What I'm looking at here is if we zone this piece of property for Mr. Lattimore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6954)|
| 1:56:00| then this other piece of property belongs to Mr. Shade right there joins it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| Then you've got the state owns the property on the other side, which I believe, Mr. Lutho,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| you said that was a part of drainage, the other two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| So we would be starting a nominal effect there, it looks to me like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| I don't know how Mr. Shade is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| He may be against it or for it, but he's not going to live forever, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:26| So, you know, then his property becomes more valuable if he's approached with someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| It would be easier for us to zone that commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| And then after you pass these other two lots at the state owns, it could just keep going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| I'm going to make a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:44| We've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| We've got one more lot, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| And then, for fairness, we need to give the applicant some additional time because opposition took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:57| Well, I think the applicant had quite a bit of time at the very beginning, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7017)|
| 1:57:04| Mr. Chairman, I have a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| Mark, if you'll go back, you're the professionals, you and your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| You all recommended to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| Tell us again why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| The Northwest County Sector Plan, which was amended to reflect a Middlebrook Pike Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:23| proposes mixed uses, including office and medium-density residential along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:30| So we found that it was consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| Generally, office on a small lot to small scale is compatible with low-density residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7054)|
| 1:57:43| The uses are generally limited to the daylight hours, so you've got eyes in your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:50| which actually help protect the neighborhood, and then folks generally leave at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| So when the folks that inhabit the homes nearby are active in their homes, the offices are inactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7075)|
| 1:58:04| So, in addition, along a major arterial such as this, low-density residential on relatively small lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:13| just don't make sense because of multiple driveway cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| So we want to encourage the mixed uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| Pardon me for interrupting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| You're speaking for MPC, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| I was asked about the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| Staff recommendation, because the overall MPC recommendation was to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| I just want to remind people of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| And if this burnt, what would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| What would this gentleman, if he wanted to build it, he'd have to come back for this body, wouldn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| Would there be any changes in the future if something happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| If the property were to remain RA, he would be limited to the uses that are allowed under that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:52| which are primarily houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| Under office, he would be allowed to develop up to 35 percent of the lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7134)|
| 1:59:03| So on a third of an acre, you might have a structure with a 5,000-square-foot footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| So when I look at what they had back in 2005, they said they were worried about two-story buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| This cannot happen in this zone where he's at, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| Yes, it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| The OA would allow the same height as the RA, which is 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:26| It's already two-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| It already allows two-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7168)|
| 1:59:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| You've got anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| Fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Just real quickly, the question was asked about the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| I think it was not clear enough, which is the uncolored piece of lot with two buildings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7183)|
| 1:59:50| That party is Mr. Cheryl Ritchie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| And he did agree and is not adverse to the Lattimores having this property changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7193)|
| 2:00:00| I think there was a question whether or not he had actually agreed with that change or not agreed with that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| I think that we've spoken quite a lot, and I appreciate this body's attention to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7206)|
| 2:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| I think we've got a substitute motion on the floor to allow the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| To allow the rezoning, and it was properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| So any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| Would you restate the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| We have a substitute motion Commissioner Lambert made to allow the rezoning of this to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7229)|
| 2:00:37| Yes vote would mean to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| Yes vote would mean to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| And no vote would deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| Is everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7247)|

| 2:00:57| What do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| We need to go back to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7258)|

| 2:05:14| As you'll notice on the next page, the density is one to five dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| We've agreed upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| Originally, he wanted one to seven, and we were able to work that out with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7521)|
| 2:05:27| and we've worked out the drainage problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7527)|

| 2:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| The recommendation was to deny MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| Should we just not withdraw that since they're in accordance to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| Sue, we've got one thing here that's where the request is for medium density, which is the original,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| which allows up to the seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7560)|

| 2:06:10| Which is the one to five, and then we could approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| That's the one we agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7573)|

| 2:10:56| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| Have you decided on how many units you're going to need per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| Sir, you need to come over to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| And if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| I'm David Alley, Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| And my address at the office is 4610 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| And the zoning will conform with the RA Low Density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| I think Commissioner Ballard asked if you knew how many units you were going to put per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7882)|
| 2:11:30| It would be low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| I don't have the complete plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7893)|
| 2:11:34| This adjoins a subdivision we're already expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| Do you know how many units you have per acre there, Mr. Alley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| I don't have it down, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| It's one to five, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| The RA Zone District controls density through a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7908)|
| 2:11:55| Typically, that will be around three in the three range as far as density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7915)|
| 2:12:02| So, with that being given, then you don't have a problem keeping it with three dwellings per unit there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| Per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| Based on that, then I will make a recommendation to accept per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7930)|
| 2:12:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=7935)|

| 2:14:13| Well, the plan and the resulting staff recommendation was to use the railroad track as the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:20| between the commercial to the east and the residential to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8060)|

| 2:20:21| And we would ask for approval per NPC recommendation, which was low density residential but plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:28| residential at 1.3 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8428)|

| 2:20:33| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8436)|
| 2:20:42| Well, before you speak, let's get an NPC report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| So we'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| This is a request for both a plan amendment and a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| Current sector plan designates this as agricultural and rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8453)|
| 2:20:58| The current zoning was a PR at a half unit per acre, which is in conformity with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8458)|
| 2:21:06| The original request was to move the planned residential density up to 2 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8466)|
| 2:21:13| which would require the LDR designation for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| This is a 103-plus acre site in Commission District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8478)|
| 2:21:27| Current land use is largely vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| Some agricultural activities have taken place, and the proposed use is for a residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8490)|
| 2:21:38| In order to achieve the densities that are being requested, the delivery of utilities to the tract is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:46| and letters from the various utility providers are in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8506)|
| 2:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| Opposition, if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| My name is Faye Smyre, address 102-04 Arnold Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| The opposition is that this is a narrow, dead-end road, and it's been this way for 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8524)|
| 2:22:14| We would like to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8534)|
| 2:22:17| Also in this area is a quarry and a mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8537)|
| 2:22:23| The quarry is going to be blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| Homes in the area have had their foundations ruined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| and wells have sunk because of the blasting in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8552)|
| 2:22:39| The mines, there is an odor that comes out from these mines that is located right next to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8559)|
| 2:22:50| And the other thing they're talking about, the children that will be in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| our schools are already overcrowded in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| There is not a school bus that runs that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| And the children would be walking out or being driven out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8582)|
| 2:23:08| and if there's 100 houses, that's approximately 200 children that will be on this narrow road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8588)|
| 2:23:17| to have to walk out to a school bus or be driven out to a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8597)|
| 2:23:25| Whenever it storms, we have power go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| and it may be out anywhere from hours to days before it is repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8610)|
| 2:23:38| And I don't think any homes coming in new are going to be without power for maybe days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8618)|
| 2:23:45| We have lost our food from freezers and stuff twice due to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8625)|
| 2:23:54| The river runs along there, and there's a possibility of flooding these homes that would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8634)|
| 2:24:02| This year is not a problem with the drought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| but in years to come there is a very good possibility of all the homes being flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8645)|
| 2:24:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, we are certainly, the applicant is certainly aware of the issues raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8656)|
| 2:24:23| as well as MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| This property is surrounded on certain areas by industrially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8666)|
| 2:24:31| It is, as a matter of fact, the mineral rights under this property are owned by the zinc company up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:37| as are the mineral rights under a good part of the property up there and a lot of Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8677)|
| 2:24:45| We are prepared to deal with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8685)|
| 2:24:48| The road issue is noted in the staff report, and I have talked to Knox County Engineering about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| as well as our engineers, Cannon and Cannon, have talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8693)|
| 2:24:59| We will be required to expand Arnold Road and make it 18 feet wide where it is not 18 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8699)|
| 2:25:07| And Harold Cannon has been up there with Cindy Pionkey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| and they have looked at the road and noted the deficiencies that will have to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8711)|
| 2:25:17| The quarry is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| You go back Arnold Lane and then up, what is it, Clear Springs, about two miles back to the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8720)|
| 2:25:28| We are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| This is a beautiful piece of property on the Holston River that we want to establish at a very low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8729)|
| 2:25:37| In nature, the utilities will have to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8737)|
| 2:25:44| This is not going to be an inexpensive subdivision because of the utility work and road work that will have to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8744)|
| 2:25:53| but we are prepared to go forward with that and would ask for approval at this very low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8753)|
| 2:25:59| Holston River flooding, TVA will not let us nor Knox County build in the 100-year flood plain, so that is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8759)|
| 2:26:11| We would ask for approval per NPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8771)|
| 2:26:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8776)|
| 2:26:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8777)|
| 2:26:18| I guess opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| I've seen some other people, I think, back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| You all have got three minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8781)|
| 2:26:22| Does anybody else wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8789)|
| 2:26:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| Well, I'm very familiar with this piece of property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| I've hunted and fished up and down this river all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| And the people there have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8798)|
| 2:26:44| But, you know, at 1.3 dwelling units per acre, I'm sure you all know where the trestle is, the black trestle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8804)|
| 2:26:51| I envision something like those homes on the other side of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| The one concern that I had was for the children because we went out there and looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| I have since talked to Knox County Schools Dr. Rick Grubb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8820)|
| 2:27:07| And any time that there's children that number 15, then a school bus will run on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8827)|
| 2:27:14| And as I understand it now, part of the problem is that you have you they drop them off at Mine Road, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8834)|
| 2:27:24| I guess that's Mine Road there to Arnold Road to Clear Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8844)|
| 2:27:29| But, nevertheless, I don't know if you have 15 children on that road now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8849)|
| 2:27:35| Because if you did, you'd have a bus that would run that road provided that they had a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8855)|
| 2:27:41| I had asked Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| I have expressed that to Mr. Seymour today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8863)|
| 2:27:46| And I will make a recommendation since they're going to improve the water, the utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8866)|
| 2:27:52| and the road at their cost, you don't get that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| I would hate to see somebody update or go to the expense to put two to five units out there sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8875)|
| 2:28:01| But the request that I make of Mr. Seymour and the developer is that in this subdivision that you'll make a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8881)|
| 2:28:07| that will comply with Knox County so that we can have a bus and safely pick up these children that will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8887)|
| 2:28:13| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| And I've talked to county engineering after you raised that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| And that will be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| So I'm going to make a recommendation that we approve her MPC request with the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8899)|
| 2:28:26| that a turnaround will exist in the cul-de-sac so that the children can be picked up safely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8906)|
| 2:28:32| maybe even the children that live on that road today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part2?start=8919)|
