| 2:34:05| that is, animus toward how badly we are treated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9245)|
| 2:34:09| rather than handled properly by consultation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| I think either straight rejection is acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9252)|
| 2:34:16| or some sort of arrangement of spacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| and guarantees that this isn't going to become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| the next project and the next project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| and the next project all in the same area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| and written guarantees, not the verbal assurances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| that have so plagued our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| That is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| That is what we want and what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| I'd leave it to you to come to the best way to achieve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| but that is where our neighborhoods are, and I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9281)|
| 2:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9285)|
| 2:34:46| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9288)|
| 2:34:49| Anybody else in the audience want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| I didn't see anybody else that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9294)|
| 2:34:55| I'll come back, but I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9297)|
| 2:34:58| Well, if somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9298)|
| 2:35:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9300)|
| 2:35:01| Madeline, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| Ms. Rojero, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| There are a couple of things I'd like to respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9305)|
| 2:35:09| Councilman Woodhull on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9309)|
| 2:35:12| When you talked about the focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| that you'd like to see more focus on the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| rather than permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9317)|
| 2:35:18| I believe that's what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| I just want to remind council that this is one piece of a larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| this is an amendment to a larger annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| and so we want to not think of this separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9328)|
| 2:35:32| but think of this all the different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| We have empowerment zone dollars in which we have put a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| empowerment zone dollars into East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9337)|
| 2:35:40| We're investing in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| We're investing in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| We have, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| the facade program has been expanded recently to the Magnolia Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9346)|
| 2:35:51| corridor as well as to downtown Vestal and some of downtown north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9351)|
| 2:35:57| The home dollars and the CDBG dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| we do significant investment in property acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| a lot of which is in East Knoxville and in other neighborhoods that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| We're working with them to try and stabilize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| So if you really look at the bigger picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| permanent supportive housing is actually a small, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9377)|
| 2:36:21| I don't have exact percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9381)|
| 2:36:22| but it's not a large percentage of the total federal dollars that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9382)|
| 2:36:26| allocate to stabilize our neighborhoods and try to build the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| infrastructure and support the homeowners and the businesses and such that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9393)|
| 2:36:34| So I just want us to not lose sight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| This is one piece with certain restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| unlike some of the other restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| The other thing is in terms of the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| the other option that we have is for a special called council meeting on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| Wednesday before Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| That is the end of the comment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| That is an option that I would be there if y'all should decide to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| Other than that, you've got Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| you've got the Friday after when folks are off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| and then Monday, I believe I'm right on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| Monday is December 1st, which is when it is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| The third point to make is that this is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9430)|
| 2:37:13| By approving this, this is not the contract with VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9433)|
| 2:37:20| This is not the contract with any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9440)|
| 2:37:23| Every one of these projects, like it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| will be dealt with again when we actually have a contract to bring to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9446)|
| 2:37:31| to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| And so I just wanted to remind you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9453)|
| 2:37:39| HUD says get a plan in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| If for some reason after the December 11th combined city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9461)|
| 2:37:45| and county commission meeting, if for some reason, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9465)|
| 2:37:49| the strategy for permanent supportive housing changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9469)|
| 2:37:52| this plan could be looked at again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| This plan can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| We tried to bring to you a plan that addressed what council has supported in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9476)|
| 2:38:01| the past and the direction we thought council was moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9481)|
| 2:38:05| We can, just like our CDBG and the other, the annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| it can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| What we need from council tonight is approval of a plan that I can submit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9489)|
| 2:38:16| HUD by December 1st, unless you decide to meet again after that comment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9496)|
| 2:38:23| I'm going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9503)|
| 2:38:24| I'm not sure whose light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| Vice Mayor Brown, I don't think has spoken on this yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| so I'll let you go next and I'll come back and pick others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9510)|
| 2:38:31| And I appreciate the comments of Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9511)|
| 2:38:37| We're back on this issue, and I have some concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9517)|
| 2:38:41| and I've stated this earlier when we approved this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9521)|
| 2:38:44| and I think I've talked to John about this, and I've talked to some other folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| and I just need to get this out on the record, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| as we're going to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| Commissioner Harmon talked about the issue of NIMBY not everything in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| I want to make sure the record accurately reflects that this project is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9537)|
| 2:39:04| One of the other projects approved is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9544)|
| 2:39:09| I'm going to be very, very, very stern and very, very, very difficult to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9549)|
| 2:39:14| from the point of NIMBY, not everything in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9554)|
| 2:39:19| And we've got a couple of these things that are in my district now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9559)|
| 2:39:24| and as we move forward through this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| and I stated very early on that we tend to have in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| all these types of projects tend to flourish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| and they don't get spread around the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| So I'm going to be looking to not only a two-mile radius kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| but I'm really looking at, quite frankly, the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| and I guess it would be the 1st District, we're stepping up to the plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| You know, we've actually had community meetings that met with John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| and some neighborhoods and met with him and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| okay, under these circumstances, we will work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| So as we move forward, I want to make sure the record reflects once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9593)|
| 2:39:57| and I stated this earlier on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| that I'm real concerned about concentration of programs like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| especially in my district, and I'm going to be drawing a line under NIMBY,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9602)|
| 2:40:07| not everything in my district because, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9607)|
| 2:40:11| everything right now with regards to the housing under this program is in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| and I think the line needs to be drawn there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| A couple quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| I guess, Mr. Herr, first just on sort of process stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9623)|
| 2:40:26| I was going to ask, you know, legally if we decide we want to move $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9626)|
| 2:40:31| from the HOPE VI foreclosure into the eSports school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9631)|
| 2:40:38| if you get a clear message from council on things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9638)|
| 2:40:42| there are ways to amend this later, there are ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| So if you hear what I think I heard you say, I want to ask you if this is clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9645)|
| 2:40:50| if council has some clear ideas of the public on how it can be different that can be dealt with down the road, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9650)|
| 2:40:57| In the future, right, that this plan can be amended just like we can amend our annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9657)|
| 2:41:06| But you try to set a direction when you set a plan, you know, so that we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9666)|
| 2:41:13| and projects, you know, the subrecipients know what to expect and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9673)|
| 2:41:19| but nothing is actually final until you all approve an individual contract with that subrecipient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9685)|
| 2:41:26| I have two other sort of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| One, well, one's a comment, one's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| I actually agree with Commissioner Harmon about some of the need for some siting requirements for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| and I know there's some talk of neighborhood involvement to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9695)|
| 2:41:40| and it's part of what the joint workshop, because we do need to make sure that they don't end up not only in the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9700)|
| 2:41:48| but not all in the 5th District and not all in the poor neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9708)|
| 2:41:52| and I think siting requirements do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| We don't want to concentrate it anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| I did have a question, I guess, for John Lawler about the Vice Mayor just said all of these things are in my district now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9718)|
| 2:42:04| and my understanding is we're actually siting, we're trying to site additional supportive housing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9724)|
| 2:42:11| but we also have a lot of places where people are being housed in permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9731)|
| 2:42:17| I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about, you know, there's a lot happening with the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9737)|
| 2:42:22| only a piece of it is MinnVilla, about what else is going on on housing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9742)|
| 2:42:26| and fixing some of the problems we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9746)|
| 2:42:29| If you don't mind, I'd like to defer that question to Ginny Weatherstone, who's here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9749)|
| 2:42:34| because BMC is their designated agency function associated with the 10-year plan is the support piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9754)|
| 2:42:40| so they really are the organization that is placing most of the chronically homeless in permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9760)|
| 2:42:46| so I'd like to defer and answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9766)|
| 2:42:47| John, but isn't Helen Ross McNabb doing that as well in some places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9767)|
| 2:42:52| I don't know, maybe Ginny can speak to that, but I think maybe I know of a couple of places that that's true of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| Yeah, as far as actual sites, there are really two entities thinking about developing permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9776)|
| 2:43:03| Southeast Housing Foundation, which is the developer of MinnVilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| and then there's Helen Ross McNabb that took it upon themselves to attempt to do 40 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9786)|
| 2:43:14| and what they're finding is that's a pretty difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9794)|
| 2:43:17| I think they have one project right now, I mean one site that's really going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| Where's that site at, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| I think it's in Councilman Becker's district in the Inskip area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9805)|
| 2:43:31| Yeah, that's the one, but, again, they're finding that their funding of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| they've raised a bunch of private dollars, but they're going to use low-income housing tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9816)|
| 2:43:41| and their investor has told them they're way out on putting their pool of funds together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9821)|
| 2:43:45| so they're probably going to end up just doing fewer than they thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| What about the project down near Sutherland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9828)|
| 2:43:51| Again, you probably have to talk to Andy Black about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| but I know that they're having to rethink the number and where at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| simply because of where the tax credit market is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| And I guess just to be clear, a lot of my concern, my question was where are people being housed now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9843)|
| 2:44:08| not where the future sites are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| Jenny, if you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| Sure, I'm Jenny Weatherstone, 9025 Candlewood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| And thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| We have, for the last year and a half, been so actively committed to housing individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9859)|
| 2:44:27| and from January 1 of 2007 until today, we have placed 133 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9867)|
| 2:44:35| Most of those individuals have been placed in KCDC facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9875)|
| 2:44:39| because they qualify for KCDC vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| So the short answer is that it is everywhere from Love Tower, Montgomery Village,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9883)|
| 2:44:50| Cagle Terrace, Isabella Towers, any place that will take a Section 8 voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9890)|
| 2:44:57| There are some places also that will take Section 8 vouchers that are not in that list that I just gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9897)|
| 2:45:03| There is an apartment complex that is located off Fox Lonas Road out west that takes Section 8 vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9903)|
| 2:45:11| So one of the things that we keep in mind is the individual who is being housed needs to be housed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9911)|
| 2:45:21| so that transportation is accessible, so that they can get to the services that they most need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9921)|
| 2:45:28| Now, some individuals, really, their concern is going to be proximity to employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9928)|
| 2:45:35| And then it is pretty wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9935)|
| 2:45:39| One of the comments that I wanted to make is that we have a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9939)|
| 2:45:43| The Volunteer Ministry Center currently has a model with the Jackson Apartments, which we own and operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9943)|
| 2:45:49| These are 16 apartments on the third floor of our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9949)|
| 2:45:53| What we tend to do, because the case managers are on site, is that there, locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9953)|
| 2:45:59| we house folks who are the neediest in terms of case management services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9959)|
| 2:46:05| Those services are readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| Though it is permanent supportive housing for many, many individuals, it becomes transitional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9968)|
| 2:46:14| And those are folks that we then can move further out into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| places where the social support is not as readily available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9978)|
| 2:46:23| and doesn't need to be because it's not as necessary as they progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9983)|
| 2:46:28| Some individuals will be there long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| But the short answer to your question is basically anywhere we can and as diverse as we can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9990)|
| 2:46:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9998)|
| 2:46:39| I think Councilman Holquist is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| Ms. Rojero, you talked about the ability to amend this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10003)|
| 2:46:50| This amendment of the plan can be amended again, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10010)|
| 2:46:53| And you and I had some of that conversation yesterday, and I'm encouraged to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10013)|
| 2:46:59| I guess I would hope that the people at HUD would understand under the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10019)|
| 2:47:05| with sort of the bums rush that Congress has put on us with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10025)|
| 2:47:09| the way they presented this funding to us, that that's almost inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| I would hope that's the case and that HUD would see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| and would not be resistant to substantial amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10037)|
| 2:47:22| But my concern is that while they might be acceptable, might accept minor amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10042)|
| 2:47:30| that major amendments to the plan, if they prove to be necessary, might still be a hard sell with HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10050)|
| 2:47:36| And I don't know, you know, you may want to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10056)|
| 2:47:40| Well, actually, minor amendments, I believe, hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10060)|
| 2:47:55| Typically, and again, we'd have to check whether it's the same with NSP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| NSP is supposed to be like CDBG, except with all these exceptions that they've made it more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10079)|
| 2:48:10| Typically, if the amendment is, for us, if the amendment is less than $100,000 change on a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10090)|
| 2:48:20| it doesn't require HUD approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| If it's over $100,000, that's considered more of a substantial amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10102)|
| 2:48:26| and it does require HUD approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10106)|
| 2:48:27| And that is done routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| On a project, you mean in this little summary sheet, this draft summary sheet numbered one through nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10110)|
| 2:48:38| including the city bandage projects and the subrecipient projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10118)|
| 2:48:42| each one of those line items would be what you're describing as a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10122)|
| 2:48:47| In other words, $100,000 on any one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| Don't hold me to the $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| We'd have to check to make sure that would be the threshold in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10134)|
| 2:48:58| But the way our CDBG program is set up, if it's over $100,000 where we actually have to submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10138)|
| 2:49:07| Otherwise, it's shown in the annual caper, which is our annual report on how we spent the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10147)|
| 2:49:12| So I would have to verify that the same threshold would exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10152)|
| 2:49:18| in having to go to HUD for a substantial amendment as is currently in our CDBG program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10158)|
| 2:49:24| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10164)|
| 2:49:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10169)|
| 2:49:30| And Becky wanted me to make sure that you understood a substantial amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10170)|
| 2:49:35| also requires citizen participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| And a substantial amendment, in fact, Knox County just has done that recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10177)|
| 2:49:43| You have to post it and you advertise it in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10183)|
| 2:49:48| and you have a public hearing when there is a substantial amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| What we haven't been able to do now because of this tight time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| So that would make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| That's the typical way to do it, and that's how we would, without having a deadline like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| that's how we would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| We would follow the process required, which would be the public hearing, press releases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| putting it out far and wide so people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| And there would be a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| Yeah, which, again, would make sense because we weren't allowed to do that on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10214)|
| 2:50:19| We'd back up and do it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| One of the concerns I had on permanent supportive housing funding support for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10221)|
| 2:50:27| line item six on your summary sheet here, you only identify the one provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10227)|
| 2:50:35| the one sub-recipient provider, and that's Southeastern Housing Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10235)|
| 2:50:43| If we wanted to do it, say, with Helen Ross McNabb, could we put it in now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10243)|
| 2:50:51| or would we have to go back and amend it later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10251)|
| 2:50:55| I mean, how would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| If you needed to put it in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| What you're saying, my understanding is that this is what's going to be in the plan submitted to HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10261)|
| 2:51:07| and we're only listing that one sub-recipient provider for, you know, that $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10267)|
| 2:51:17| Could you hold on just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10277)|
| 2:51:18| I want to check with 10-year plan folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10278)|
| 2:51:23| I don't mean to jump in here, but the actual pot of money you're addressing is a follow-up to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10283)|
| 2:51:30| and I heard John talking earlier when I talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| and I appreciate what was pointed out earlier at the request of Council Member Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10293)|
| 2:51:38| but out of that pot of money and the Menvilla pot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10298)|
| 2:51:42| my understanding is those two projects are coming in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| and that's what I was speaking to was this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| and not the continuing placement that they do and have done through KCDC over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10308)|
| 2:51:54| But when we're talking about these new units, I know of Menvilla, which is in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10314)|
| 2:51:58| and also, and John can come back later and please answer his question for me if he doesn't know anything about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10318)|
| 2:52:03| but the units that are also out of Sutter, I thought you were aware of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| and with regards to what was going on there, so I'm glad you're getting into the question about the $800,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10326)|
| 2:52:11| because those new projects still bring me back and I hold my position with regards to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10331)|
| 2:52:16| not everything in my district because those two new projects are right there in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10336)|
| 2:52:21| So thank you for asking that question, Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| You know, Councilman Brown, I take care of the settlement end of your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10344)|
| 2:52:30| Let's go ahead, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| I'm waiting for an answer back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10352)|
| 2:52:35| I believe that the – we believe that until the contract is signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10355)|
| 2:52:41| it doesn't necessarily have to be the subrecipient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10361)|
| 2:52:43| It's the project that the development of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10363)|
| 2:52:50| that's what's important here, and the $800,000 to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10370)|
| 2:52:54| If, in fact, there was – if this developer of the Southeastern Housing Foundation for some reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10374)|
| 2:53:00| was not the developer of the next project that we wanted to use these funds for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10380)|
| 2:53:07| that could still be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10387)|
| 2:53:12| And I believe it's going to require – it wouldn't require a substantial amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| because the money is still being put into the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10398)|
| 2:53:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| We would still be building permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| And that's all that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10404)|
| 2:53:25| For those dollars, and that's all that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10405)|
| 2:53:27| That's how I understand the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10409)|
| 2:53:30| That's just something I want to get clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10410)|
| 2:53:34| I don't want to get us off on too much of a tangent here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10414)|
| 2:53:37| If, in fact, if one of the other – one, two, or three here –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10417)|
| 2:53:40| if one of those subrecipients could not – decided they didn't want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10420)|
| 2:53:44| if we had another subrecipient that basically carried out the goals of that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10424)|
| 2:53:48| we could do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10428)|
| 2:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10429)|
| 2:53:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10430)|
| 2:53:51| It's in our past experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10431)|
| 2:53:52| Real quick, Councilman Frost has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10432)|
| 2:53:56| This may sound like a tangent, and I don't think we need to get into it in any detail now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10436)|
| 2:54:01| but one of the concerns here is impacting fragile neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10441)|
| 2:54:06| and the way we tend to silo, or stovepipe, if you will, projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10446)|
| 2:54:11| so that they say, well, we've distributed this particular pot of money in this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10451)|
| 2:54:17| but we don't step back and look at how the same communities are impacted by other public investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10457)|
| 2:54:24| or quasi-public investments, whether it's halfway houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10464)|
| 2:54:29| which are usually quasi-public or private funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10469)|
| 2:54:34| but often there's some public dollars in one form or another in those projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| whether it goes through the city or not, halfway houses, low-income tax credit developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10478)|
| 2:54:44| Section 8 housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| I don't think we have a good analysis of that to really determine, and maybe I'm wrong, but I've never seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10487)|
| 2:54:53| I think I'd love to see us with our GIS system begin to identify where those concentrations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10493)|
| 2:55:01| Actually, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| We are developing a mapping project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| One of the things we wanted to do this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10507)|
| 2:55:10| and we're in the process of working with the IS Department and KGIS on this and MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10510)|
| 2:55:19| is to be able to map, first of all, where we're making our investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10519)|
| 2:55:23| whether it's the federal dollars or the city dollars that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| and all the different impacts on our neighborhoods to be able to map those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10527)|
| 2:55:32| Positive and negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| Positive, exactly, positive and negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| You want to show where the blighted properties are that have been identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10536)|
| 2:55:39| where the houses have been rehabbed, because what we have tried to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10539)|
| 2:55:43| and we've talked about this the last two years I've been here when we've discussed the annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10543)|
| 2:55:48| is how to be most strategic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| And so if we know that, for example, there are some rehabs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10550)|
| 2:55:54| people are taking out loans from us or others to do rehabs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10554)|
| 2:55:58| they're investing in their neighborhood and we know there's some blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| or there's something that needs to be demolished perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10561)|
| 2:56:04| you want to support that private sector, that homeowner investment by investing our dollars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10564)|
| 2:56:10| You know, there's been a certain, the way we've approached a lot of rehabs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10570)|
| 2:56:14| this sort of first come, first serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| That seems to be a fair way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| However, we also want to add a layer of strategy to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10578)|
| 2:56:22| that where we have other ways made, whether it's private sector or public sector investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10582)|
| 2:56:28| by being able to map this we can see where that's occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10588)|
| 2:56:32| and maybe move a housing rehab up because it's going to help the other rehabs that have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10592)|
| 2:56:39| You know, it's going to impact the larger community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| So we share the same concern that you have in terms of mapping the negative and the positive impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10603)|
| 2:56:49| and we are working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| We need to understand the totality of our investments and whether they're helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10610)|
| 2:56:54| or harming a particular community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10616)|
| 2:56:57| We want to be very strategic where we invest, and knowing where those are will help, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| First, I do want to thank Mark Harmon and Amy Royals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10623)|
| 2:57:09| Mark, in particular, I've communicated with both of them about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10629)|
| 2:57:13| and what they're trying to do with our friends in county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10633)|
| 2:57:17| but Mark has definitely gone above and beyond the call of good representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10637)|
| 2:57:23| He's exceeded that, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| There are some great things here in this plan, and there's some good things here in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10647)|
| 2:57:32| One thing that really frustrates me is the Eastport School $869,000, and here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10652)|
| 2:57:41| I don't begrudge that project one bit, but about three or four years ago we had a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10661)|
| 2:57:48| and we talked about spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to knock down part of Austin Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10668)|
| 2:57:54| So we're knocking down housing in one year and spending a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10674)|
| 2:57:59| and here we come back a few years later spending $869,000 to redo something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10679)|
| 2:58:08| I have issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10688)|
| 2:58:14| I'm really disappointed about the public notice process that we're supposedly going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10694)|
| 2:58:22| I mean, the first day of the public notice was Veterans Day, a federal holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10702)|
| 2:58:28| I counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10708)|
| 2:58:29| There are ten days that aren't holidays or weekends allowed for public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10709)|
| 2:58:37| You know, it looks like from the paperwork we've been provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10717)|
| 2:58:42| HUD issued the program requirements on October 6, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10722)|
| 2:58:47| Maybe they didn't get to the city here on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10727)|
| 2:58:51| But, you know, there were no public meetings set up to discuss any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10731)|
| 2:58:59| I mean, granted, I heard Mrs. O'Hara was on the radio this morning discussing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10739)|
| 2:59:06| but there were no public meetings, and we're being asked to vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10746)|
| 2:59:10| when the public comment period hasn't even ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10750)|
| 2:59:15| I mean, the e-mails that we got were from, you know, primarily from people at Habitat, from humanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10755)|
| 2:59:23| most of whom I know, and I like Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10763)|
| 2:59:27| I've worked on Habitat houses before, but I looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10767)|
| 2:59:32| Fourteen of the 16 e-mails came in a two-hour and eight-minute period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| That's an electronic altar call, if you ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10777)|
| 2:59:44| And, you know, this isn't public input, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10784)|
| 2:59:51| It's window dressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| I mean, we're talking of this approximately $4.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10793)|
| 2:59:58| almost $1.8 million of it is for two things, $975,000 for Menvilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10798)|
| 3:00:05| and $800,000 for the development of permanent supportive housing locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10805)|
| 3:00:11| to be determined under the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10811)|
| 3:00:18| Just the lack of allowing people to comment does not sit well with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10818)|
| 3:00:25| I mean, the way I found out about it, I looked on the city website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10825)|
| 3:00:29| and came across it on the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| I did get an e-mail, but I saw it on the city website first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10831)|
| 3:00:36| And the idea of, you know, when Menvilla started out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| it was certainly a very laudable project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| But right now we're looking at housing at about $200 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10844)|
| 3:00:52| That's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10852)|
| 3:00:56| I have an issue if I want to spend that much money on my home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10856)|
| 3:01:01| if Bob Becker does, if Joe Bailey does, have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| Really, is this a prudent use of taxpayer funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| I really have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10871)|
| 3:01:14| I understand some things might have been set in motion by HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10874)|
| 3:01:19| but I'm sorry, it just doesn't sit well with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10879)|
| 3:01:24| And let me just say one more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10884)|
| 3:01:25| because I want to speak up for our community development department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10885)|
| 3:01:28| They're hand-tied here by what HUD said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10888)|
| 3:01:30| I was actually on the watch last week, talked with some HUD folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10890)|
| 3:01:33| They said they had the order from Congress, get this money out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10893)|
| 3:01:38| And Congress was pushing them to get that out and put the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10898)|
| 3:01:41| and we're unfortunately at the end of that chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10901)|
| 3:01:44| And I know Madeline and Becky and their whole team have worked hard to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10904)|
| 3:01:47| everything they can, but we can only do what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| We understand the frustration, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| but please don't take out on us what we've worked hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| or what Madeline and her team have worked hard to make happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10914)|
| 3:01:57| We share the frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10917)|
| 3:01:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10918)|
| 3:01:59| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10919)|
| 3:02:00| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10920)|
| 3:02:01| Just very quickly in response to Councilman Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10921)|
| 3:02:04| I remember the Austin Homes issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| I don't remember it as being an issue of where not to spend the money to tear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10926)|
| 3:02:10| them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10930)|
| 3:02:11| The whole issue was someone decided that they thought public housing was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| historic, and I did not agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10934)|
| 3:02:17| And there were two or three folk who lived there that thought it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| and we all thought that taking Austin Homes down was a beneficial thing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10939)|
| 3:02:23| the neighborhood, and it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10943)|
| 3:02:25| That neighborhood is kind of beginning to turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10945)|
| 3:02:28| With regards to Eastport, that's not community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10948)|
| 3:02:32| That's a KCDC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| There have been discussions for the last several years about how do we deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10954)|
| 3:02:37| with Walter P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10957)|
| 3:02:38| Taylor Home and ultimately end up in a position similar to what we have with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10958)|
| 3:02:42| the development over at Hope Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| This is a way to kind of begin there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| KCDC has tried several different ways and have additional dollars to go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| this project that they can keep part of Walter P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10970)|
| 3:02:55| Taylor as a senior citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10975)|
| 3:02:58| also develop those other units up there as senior citizens so we can begin to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10978)|
| 3:03:01| take down some of Walter P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10981)|
| 3:03:03| Taylor's old housing there and begin to put some single-family housing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10983)|
| 3:03:06| there with KCDC getting money from the federal government to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10986)|
| 3:03:10| which will, in the long run, improve the housing stock there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10990)|
| 3:03:13| the price of housing there, and also help secure the development that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10993)|
| 3:03:16| already in Five Points and the things we're doing at Chestnut and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10996)|
| 3:03:19| that we've been doing over the years in places like Park Ridge and all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| Park City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11002)|
| 3:03:23| So I see at least those particular two pieces as a little different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11003)|
| 3:03:28| and I hope that we don't mix those up in what I think is a very valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| discussion about the MN Villa issue and the permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11011)|
| 3:03:35| issue and also the notice and public hearing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11015)|
| 3:03:38| So I wanted to address those very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11018)|
| 3:03:41| because I didn't see the Austin Homes thing or remember as being one about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11021)|
| 3:03:44| whether or not we should spend that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| but whether or not they were historic structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11026)|
| 3:03:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11032)|
| 3:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11033)|
| 3:03:54| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11034)|
| 3:03:55| I'd remind you right now there's not a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| I would remind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11037)|
| 3:03:58| So, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| I'll move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11040)|
| 3:04:01| There's a motion for approval and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11043)|
| 3:04:06| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11046)|
| 3:04:09| With all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11049)|
| 3:04:10| I can't vote in good conscience on something with a public comment period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| still running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| Then if this Council feels strongly, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| our hands are bound by forces beyond us, out of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11061)|
| 3:04:26| But if we feel strongly that the public comment period is critical to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11066)|
| 3:04:30| process, then let's commit tonight that we're going to have a special call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11070)|
| 3:04:33| meeting next Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| Is that when the public comment period ends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| Is Wednesday the last day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11078)|
| 3:04:39| The 26th that ends, which is Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| Which is Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11081)|
| 3:04:42| And it's due in Washington the following Monday after the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11082)|
| 3:04:45| I'm in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11085)|
| 3:04:46| I'll come Wednesday and place a vote and talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| But I need to hear from other people that that's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11089)|
| 3:04:52| And we can keep wringing our hands about it, or we can call a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11092)|
| 3:04:58| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11098)|
| 3:04:59| I'm going to go to Councilman Peel, and then I'll come to Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11099)|
| 3:05:01| And normally I would be right here for a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11101)|
| 3:05:04| I don't think I've ever missed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11104)|
| 3:05:06| But we have a daughter who lives in Louisiana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11106)|
| 3:05:10| and we were supposed to drive to Louisiana with another part of our family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11110)|
| 3:05:15| that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11115)|
| 3:05:18| Personally, it would pose a big disappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11118)|
| 3:05:21| But I just felt I needed to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11121)|
| 3:05:24| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11124)|
| 3:05:25| I guess just to echo Ms. Peel, I'd be willing to do it, but I will be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11125)|
| 3:05:29| I'll be with the family in Richmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11129)|
| 3:05:32| I trust you all to make the right decision, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11132)|
| 3:05:36| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| Well, I'm willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| I'm willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| I have to leave town at some point that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| But if we did it, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11146)|
| 3:05:50| Technically, when the public comment period ends, is it at 5 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11150)|
| 3:05:55| Yeah, end of business day on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11155)|
| 3:05:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11159)|
| 3:06:00| Well, I think we would have most of the comments by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11160)|
| 3:06:03| I'd be willing to meet at 2 or 3 o'clock and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11163)|
| 3:06:09| You also leave Madeline and her team starting Thanksgiving morning to get a report out Monday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11169)|
| 3:06:14| just as a note as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11174)|
| 3:06:18| I'm in town and willing to do it if that's the pleasure of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11178)|
| 3:06:22| I understand Councilman Frost's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11182)|
| 3:06:27| I actually share it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11187)|
| 3:06:29| However, I have discussed even outside the administration the time constraint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11189)|
| 3:06:37| and time compression here and feel fairly comfortable that it's not of our own doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11197)|
| 3:06:42| It's actually, as the mayor said, something that actually how it has come out of Congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11202)|
| 3:06:47| and how it's been placed upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| So you're kind of in a position, well, how do you manage this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11209)|
| 3:06:53| You've got an opportunity for some additional dollars to make a positive impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11213)|
| 3:06:57| even though we're debating how to use those dollars, at least some of those dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11217)|
| 3:07:01| but to make a positive impact in the lives of individuals and in communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11221)|
| 3:07:06| So in balancing that against Councilman Frost's concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11226)|
| 3:07:11| I'm leaning towards going ahead and approving this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11231)|
| 3:07:14| but if we want to have a special call council meeting, I'm willing to come in on Wednesday and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11234)|
| 3:07:20| I think this is an exception to the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11240)|
| 3:07:23| I would be right with Councilman Frost, and I suspect when we're out speaking for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11243)|
| 3:07:27| Councilman Becker would be right there also on the issue of notice and public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11247)|
| 3:07:32| But I do think that we are legitimately in a box here, in a quagmire here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11252)|
| 3:07:38| that we need to resolve and hopefully resolve to the plus of the citizens and the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11258)|
| 3:07:43| because these dollars spent here are less taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11263)|
| 3:07:46| so we're going to have to spend out of our own coffers over the next year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11266)|
| 3:07:49| which are going to be dwindling based on the current economic situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11269)|
| 3:07:53| So we've actually got a pool of money here to have an impact that we may be sending $4.5 million back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11273)|
| 3:07:59| because we've got an eight-day issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11279)|
| 3:08:03| So let's decide if that's worth sending $4.5 million back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11283)|
| 3:08:08| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| I was just going to say we could do it Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| I mean, that's just one day short of the full public commenting period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11292)|
| 3:08:15| if that would accommodate some schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| But I, too, am in town, and I would be happy to come to a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11297)|
| 3:08:22| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| Well, maybe that's the way to do it, just one day short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11304)|
| 3:08:27| That's a lot better than where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| That's a week from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| Councilman Frost, how would you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11311)|
| 3:08:33| I'm in town all next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11315)|
| 3:08:36| I'll make a motion that we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11316)|
| 3:08:37| Actually, there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| I'm going to make a motion to postpone, which takes precedence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11319)|
| 3:08:43| to a special call council meeting on a week from today at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11323)|
| 3:08:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11331)|
| 3:08:52| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11332)|
| 3:08:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| Before we vote, let me check my calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11335)|
| 3:08:58| Yeah, we'll have to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11338)|
| 3:09:00| Ms. Mitchell, just remind me, we'll have to find a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11343)|
| 3:09:04| I've got to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11344)|
| 3:09:05| You have a transit subcommittee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11345)|
| 3:09:06| I've got to – yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11346)|
| 3:09:07| And then make it at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11347)|
| 3:09:08| Make it 5 just to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11348)|
| 3:09:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11351)|
| 3:09:12| The motion then –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11352)|
| 3:09:13| 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11353)|
| 3:09:14| Right now is to postpone until 5 o'clock Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11354)|
| 3:09:19| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11359)|
| 3:09:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11360)|
| 3:09:21| I'm going to be out of town then as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| So far, I've never missed a council meeting, and I don't want to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11363)|
| 3:09:27| I'm going to argue against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| I'm going to point out to folks that this has been open for public comment for seven days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11369)|
| 3:09:33| and we really haven't gotten much public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11373)|
| 3:09:36| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11376)|
| 3:09:38| If this is the public comment that we got here, people that spoke to us tonight haven't even made a public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11378)|
| 3:09:43| I don't know that we're going to get any additional significant public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11383)|
| 3:09:47| I think we'll come here, and we'll have some of the same discussions we had now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11387)|
| 3:09:51| and we'll do what we're going to do now anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11391)|
| 3:09:53| So I'm going to vote against the postponement, but that's kind of self-centered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11393)|
| 3:09:57| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11397)|
| 3:09:58| I just want to concur to some extent with Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11398)|
| 3:10:02| I have probably received 10 emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11402)|
| 3:10:05| I did receive an email from Mr. McDaniel, and I appreciated that, and I responded to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11405)|
| 3:10:12| I've responded to every email I've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11412)|
| 3:10:15| But that's the extent of it, and, frankly, that is a small number of emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11415)|
| 3:10:19| But I do feel that I got the drift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11419)|
| 3:10:24| Mr. McDaniel, I'd like to make one quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11424)|
| 3:10:26| Mr. Wright, do you want to say something while he's coming down, or do you want him to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11426)|
| 3:10:28| Go ahead, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11428)|
| 3:10:29| It's actually just a question to the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11429)|
| 3:10:33| If you all could let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| Obviously, the NSP is pretty complicated, but what are you looking for from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11435)|
| 3:10:40| Let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11444)|
| 3:10:45| I was just going to say, I hope you have an open line of communication with Ms. Rojero and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11445)|
| 3:10:51| I think they can tell you exactly their process and what they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11451)|
| 3:10:55| I think the kind of comments that, quite frankly, you've given tonight, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| about the utilization of the funds and what you're thinking about the suggestion on how they're going to be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11458)|
| 3:11:03| Is that correct, Director Rojero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| People are invited to email Becky Wade, bwade, at cityofknoxville.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11467)|
| 3:11:14| Also, Becky took comments or took notes from the comments made tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11474)|
| 3:11:19| so anybody who commented tonight is welcome to submit an email directly to Becky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11479)|
| 3:11:25| or we will have a summarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11485)|
| 3:11:28| Really, what we do in these, we will have every email on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11488)|
| 3:11:33| We summarize the comments in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11493)|
| 3:11:38| So if five people said, yay for Habitat, we'll say five people are in support of Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11498)|
| 3:11:45| If there are distinctive comments, we would separate those out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11505)|
| 3:11:49| but we don't put in 50 sheets or whatever in the actual plan, but we will have those on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11509)|
| 3:11:54| We will summarize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11514)|
| 3:11:56| So, Doug, I invite you to submit something in writing to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11516)|
| 3:12:00| or we will summarize what you said tonight in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11520)|
| 3:12:06| And these are not, we also don't identify individuals, we just identify comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11526)|
| 3:12:11| but all of that we have the backup in our file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| So can I, just real quick, I'm just asking really as a proxy for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11533)|
| 3:12:18| because there aren't a lot of public here tonight, but I know that folks are interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11538)|
| 3:12:23| but what is your criteria process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| Just to recap what you were just saying, is it like I'm for it or against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11545)|
| 3:12:29| No, I mean, any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11549)|
| 3:12:30| You can say I'm for it, I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11550)|
| 3:12:32| You can say I don't think we should spend money on Minvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| You can say I think we should support acquisition of blighted property, of foreclosed properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11556)|
| 3:12:41| Whatever, read the plan and whatever your response is to it, all of that is what is requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11561)|
| 3:12:48| Your comment, for, against, neutral, you know, on the whole thing, on any individual piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11568)|
| 3:12:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11576)|
| 3:12:57| And everything is open for comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11577)|
| 3:12:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11578)|
| 3:12:59| Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| I was going to say I'm going to vote against the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11580)|
| 3:13:02| I support the public process, and I understand that the comment period is still going to be open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11582)|
| 3:13:07| and we will still have those comments available to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11587)|
| 3:13:10| and if there's a substantial amendment, as Councilman Hulkus was saying earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11590)|
| 3:13:14| I think there's tweaks that we can make to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11594)|
| 3:13:16| but I honestly don't think we're going to make major changes to this plan on the Tuesday night before Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11596)|
| 3:13:23| particularly the position that it's going to put Director O'Hara and her staff going into a holiday period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11603)|
| 3:13:28| and trying to get this plan to Washington in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11608)|
| 3:13:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11612)|
| 3:13:33| Other, Mr. Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| I'm trying to be very diplomatic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| You know, I suggested earlier tonight, you all remember the Gibbs drives debate two hours ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11618)|
| 3:13:44| about we're going into the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| We're asking Kroger's to do something, and we're asking City Engineer to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11627)|
| 3:13:51| and we're asking these neighborhood people to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11631)|
| 3:13:54| And I threw out the idea of a four-week postponement because of the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11634)|
| 3:14:00| And that wasn't going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11640)|
| 3:14:04| So we got a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11644)|
| 3:14:06| So just a rhetorical question, what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11646)|
| 3:14:13| My understanding is doesn't this plan have to be in by December 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11653)|
| 3:14:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11656)|
| 3:14:17| In order to receive $4.5 million, we have got to submit this by December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11657)|
| 3:14:23| And with Kroger's and the Gibbs drive folks, nobody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| The money will be reallocated to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11665)|
| 3:14:28| And I didn't hear a dropped deadline date from Kroger's or the Gibbs folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11668)|
| 3:14:32| As a matter of fact, the way you put it for California Falls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11672)|
| 3:14:35| they came here wanting to get an extension of time to talk is what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| I was throwing out a four-week extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| I think your point is very valid, except for unless I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11681)|
| 3:14:45| You know, what I hear is that December 1st is a drop-dead date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11685)|
| 3:14:48| That's the only difference I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| And I think you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11690)|
| 3:14:51| If that wasn't there, I'd put it off four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| and let's come back and have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| Oh, let's go back to license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| Am I wrong about December 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11699)|
| 3:15:00| No, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11700)|
| 3:15:01| December 1st is the drop-dead date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11701)|
| 3:15:02| We have to have it in the local field office, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| across the street there on December 1st or we lose the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11705)|
| 3:15:10| And if we don't, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11710)|
| 3:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11711)|
| 3:15:12| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11712)|
| 3:15:13| But the issue he was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| we're asking community development to do something with the holidays right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11715)|
| 3:15:19| and we're asking the neighborhood and city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| and maybe Kroger's to do the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| So I'm sure folks are seeing distinctions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11724)|
| 3:15:28| but I'm just having a little finding a discrepancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11728)|
| 3:15:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| Right now, do you have something else, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11734)|
| 3:15:35| No, I'm just going to say the time compression I think is a very valid difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11735)|
| 3:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11739)|
| 3:15:40| Right now, the motion on the floor is to postpone until Tuesday at 5 at a location to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11740)|
| 3:15:48| We're meeting at your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11748)|
| 3:15:51| Hamburgers on the grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11751)|
| 3:15:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11752)|
| 3:15:53| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11753)|
| 3:15:54| All those in favor of postponement, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11757)|
| 3:15:58| Those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11758)|
| 3:16:01| Let's just do a real quick roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11761)|
| 3:16:02| Sorry, I think I heard 6-3, but let me make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11765)|
| 3:16:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11766)|
| 3:16:07| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11767)|

| 3:16:09| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11769)|
| 3:16:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11770)|

| 3:16:13| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11773)|

| 3:16:15| Councilman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11775)|
| 3:16:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11776)|
| 3:16:17| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11777)|
| 3:16:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11778)|
| 3:16:19| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11779)|
| 3:16:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11780)|
| 3:16:21| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11781)|
| 3:16:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11782)|
| 3:16:23| It passes 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| So council will meet at 5 o'clock Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11785)|
| 3:16:29| We, I guess Ms. Mitchell's office will let you know the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11789)|
| 3:16:36| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11796)|
| 3:16:38| Ms. Rojero, I guess at some point late in the day Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11798)|
| 3:16:41| if your office could send out some kind of compilation of those comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| or I guess have them ready for us at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11805)|
| 3:16:48| I mean, I guess that's the relevant piece that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| We will have that summary of public comments for you at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=11810)|
