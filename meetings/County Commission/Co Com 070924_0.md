| 0:08:28| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Clerk, I want to ask a quick question if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| I noticed that here that they did not check if there had been any drug violations in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| And I'm looking through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| There's a couple of these that do not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Can they check that before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| There's a couple of them here that that is not checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Over here, Creekside Enterprise, it's not checked on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| And we can just sort ofâ€¦| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| For that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Well, they've just responded to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| One of the purposes of this hearing is to put it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| And they have been sworn today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| But there is a place on the application, is what they're referring to, that basically asks the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| the first question that I ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| have any persons whose names appear above been convicted of any violation of the liquor law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the last ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| State law says we have to ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| And certainly the answer must be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| We can take a look at that closer whenever they file their applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| Maybe we can ask folks to be a little bit more complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=578)|

| 0:16:01| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=961)|
| 0:16:09| As far as the people working at the place, I don't know because I've not hired them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| But I have a DUI and an O2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=977)|

| 0:16:40| And this is an application for both on and off premise consumption, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1004)|

| 0:17:15| So the business is going to be run by you and your wife, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1035)|

| 0:17:31| Is your wife familiar with the beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| As co-owner, she needs to get familiar with them, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1059)|

| 0:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1084)|

| 0:18:23| I'm going to concur with the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| And your concurrence is that there's been a conviction for DUI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Fire Marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| I guess I have two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Issue number one is I really believe that if someone is going to be an owner-partner, they should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| And I understand your wife is on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| But I believe that, you know, we need to hear from her directly about the questions that the law director has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| So that would be my first issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| The second issue, Mr. Law Director, is with regards to this DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| What considerations do we need as a beer board to place on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| Well, a DUI in and of itself, even a conviction for a DUI, has been ruled by courts, you know, not to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1146)|
| 0:19:16| this board could not use that to turn down a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1156)|
| 0:19:26| Certainly something that you can take into consideration, but it should not be the overriding factor in turning down an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1166)|
| 0:19:38| This gentleman has testified that he had a conviction in 2002, and I believe he testified that he hadn't had a drop to drink since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1178)|
| 0:19:50| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Commissioner Hammond does make a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Your partner probably ought to be here, and she ought to be, you know, familiar with the business and the beer laws and the regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1195)|
| 0:20:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Well, she's my partner in the LLC, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| I spent a few minutes talking with this gentleman, and I do think he's learned his lesson as far as the DUI he got in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| And I agree with Mr. Hammond that I do, you know, like it better when, you know, when both applicants are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1224)|
| 0:20:32| But haven't we approved them in the past when one of the applicants was here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Well, in light of that, I really think we ought to make the motion that we approve this and wish this man luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| He has learned his lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| I think one thing, the fact that he has been there himself, he knows the importance of these alcohol laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| because he's actually suffered the consequences of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| So I don't think we should let a 2002 DUI conviction keep this man from making a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| May I add something to that, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| I was a beer lover, like most drinkers are, and I have learned to accept an N.A. beer in its place because I don't need the alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1272)|
| 0:21:26| And I plan to keep this readily for my customers, too, and suggest drinking some because I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1286)|
| 0:21:41| It's a hard thing to come by because the convenience stores won't put it on the shelves because it takes up shelf space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1301)|
| 0:21:50| You have to go to the grocery stores to buy it, and a lot of the bars and stuff do not offer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| And I do plan on having a good selection of it in my establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| There are still two items that will be pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| You have the health department report that will be pending related to this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| and your wife needs to get the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| How long have you been married?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| I've been married 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| So this woman that's your partner, you've been married for 20 years, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| One thing, I'll just make a personal recommendation to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| Do a ride-along some night with our DUI task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| They're really nice folks and see why we're so concerned about the DUIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1357)|
| 0:22:46| And, you know, I think it will open your eyes a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| You've already seen it from one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| I think that will make you a better vendor than most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| I have seen it and I know the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| I have repented on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| There's no chance of me committing that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| And I certainly wouldn't want my consumers to either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| There's been a first and a second from Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| I'd like to make an amendment, if I might, if Mr. Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| and Mr. Green would agree to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| I want to make sure that the second owner has done what we have asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| Would you accept as an amendment that this gentleman will report back to us within 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| that, indeed, the training has been accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| and that all of the questions have been answered satisfactorily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| Then I can vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Otherwise, I'm voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Do you agree with that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| I accept the amendment and the second accepts it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| All in favor of the motion and the amendment say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| You'll have that class taken real quick and report back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Also, could you let us know in the beer board meeting, this is September by November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| that, indeed, that has happened, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| We've got Mr. Minot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Mr. Minot, you'll track that, will you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| The last item is 6E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| It's Aubrey's, Inc., doing business at Aubrey's Restaurant at 9208 Middlebrook Pike, on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1464)|
| 0:24:36| Hello, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Hey, my name is David Belcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| I'm Mark Liggett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| First, there was something called to my attention about this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| It may be that this property is out of compliance with our zoning regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1492)|
| 0:25:01| Do you all know anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| We have asked for an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| We're meeting on September 26th, which is Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| You're going before BZA for a variance, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| All right, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Have either of you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| This is a new location, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| So beer has not been sold here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| There's no outstanding license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Application for on-premise consumption, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| And who owns the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| Aubrey Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| Does anyone besides Aubrey's, Inc., have an interest in the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| And who's going to operate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| That would be me and Andy Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Is Mr. Burleson available today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| He's on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| He is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| He has actually had a flight delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Tell me your all's roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| You said that, if you would state your name again, you're going to be the manager of this restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| I'm the director of operations for Aubrey's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| And I will actually be a functioning manager in that location when we open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| And what was your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1606)|

| 0:26:48| Okay, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| And my name is David Belcher, and I'm the CFO of Aubrey's, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1609)|

| 0:26:53| Thanks, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| If you all have been around Aubrey's, Inc. a while, then you're both familiar with the beer laws and regulations, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| And you agree to conduct this business in conformity with the beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1622)|

| 0:27:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1627)|

| 0:27:12| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| How about you, Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| I have not, but I'm not involved in the operations side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Beer Board Inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1649)|

| 0:27:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| What we have is, at this location, it is, oh, how many feet from a residential zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1655)|
| 0:27:47| I believe it's 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Seventy feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| So you're coming before BZA this Wednesday requesting a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1669)|
| 0:27:56| Have you already made that request and you're on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| And the request is for a variance to zero feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1684)|

| 0:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| Any commissioners have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| I'd like a motion that we approve it pending approval by the BZA on Wednesday and pending the other reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1694)|

| 0:28:23| I just want to say that we have an Aubrey's just off Emory Road that kind of serves both my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| the 6th District, and our Larry's District, the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| And it's been a great asset to our community, and we're glad that you folks are growing and expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| And I'm sure that the folks in this neighborhood will enjoy Aubrey's as much as my neighbors do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1724)|

| 0:28:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Yes, Mr. Minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| On that first one, CK's chatterbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| I tried to get back before you all put it off until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| I was talking to Ms. Kathy Lee on the phone when you was voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| She don't want a part of that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| So I'd like for you all to consider next time if they come in that both of them are here, Ms. Allen and Ms. Lee both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1761)|
| 0:29:31| Well, Ms. Lee, is she wanting to take her name off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| She didn't want to have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| And I want you all to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| We'll look at that next month when they come back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| And, Mr. Minor, if you'll remind us of that too when it comes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1790)|

| 0:30:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| I'd like to introduce the Reverend James McTeer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| minister of our church, Lake Hills Presbyterian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| He's been there 13 years, a good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| James?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| Creator God, in whom we live and move and have our being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| you have made us for yourself so that our hearts are restless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1875)|

| 0:31:32| that in your light we may see light clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| and in service find perfect freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Grant this commission the wisdom to govern this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| help them to make just decisions on behalf of all its citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| rich and poor, of different races and religions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Help them to make Knox County a shining example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| of generous compassion and fair thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Bless them and bless us all as we care for this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| this nation, and this earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| If everyone will please stand, Commissioner Sharon Cawood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| will lead us to the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| Join me as we pledge to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1946)|
| 0:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| We're on amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| I've got a couple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Agenda items to be deferred, that we defer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| Items to be added, that we add them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| The ones to be withdrawn, be withdrawn on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| Resolution 105, be deferred until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1971)|
| 0:33:00| Page eight, Resolution 905, dealing with the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1980)|
| 0:33:09| They ask for that to be deferred until our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| And on page 11, 302, that's to be taken off by the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=1992)|
| 0:33:26| withdrawn from the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| And also on page 16, 901 and 902, dealing with the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| If we can move that up right after we do the consent items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| since we have a lot of county employees here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| let's see if we can get them back to work so they don't have to sit here all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| Consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Mr. Chairman, it's Commissioner Harmon over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| I just want to make sure that 908 is on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| And that 503 is not on consent because I would like to abstain on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| 50 what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| 503.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| It's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Could you please remove it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| I would like to abstain on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| And is 908 on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2055)|
| 0:34:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| I'd like to ask that resolution number 104 be deferred 30 days, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| It's on page 3, 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Without objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| 101 on page 2 and 102 on page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| If I could defer those 30 days, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| 101 on page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| And 102 on page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Deferred 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| If we have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| On second reading, can we move 101 stormwater ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Can we move that until just after the insurance issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| I think we've got a lot of folks here concerned with that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| and we could get that out of the way pretty early if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| What page are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| On second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Commissioner Craiglin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Items 906 and 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| I need to abstain from those two items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| and I don't know if we need to actually remove them from the consent or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| if my vote would reflect that I am abstaining from those two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| Mr. Law Director, is it need to remove them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| And then I need items 906 and 907 removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| We'll remove 906 and 907 on page 17 without objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Seeing none, Commissioner Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| I sense we have two commissioners that just wanted to recuse themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| which would only take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Why don't we do those right after the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=2191)|

| 0:51:53| This is a resolution approving a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| with Connecticut General Life Insurance Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| also known as Cigna Healthcare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| for the provision of self-insured medical administration services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| disease management services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| and pharmacy benefits management services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Intergovernmental voted 9-0 with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| NG with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Commissioner Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| I want to ask the Law Director a question and try to get this clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Here's what I think I've learned so far about this insurance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| One is, obviously, what we're doing is hiring an administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| Two is, the program has been designed, I believe, mostly by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| if that may not be exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| I've talked to a bunch of employees, probably 25 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| What I would like to do is to try to do, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| whatever we need to to put this off 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| and try to get all these companies to agree to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| work on the program a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| and see if we cannot do something to provide better insurance for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| I've talked to people who think the deductible is going to $1,200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| which is true in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| I've talked to people whose premium is going up $30, $40 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| And I realize that insurance is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| I'm just not convinced that we have done as good a job as we can for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| And I don't know what we need to do to get there, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| Well, what you have before you is an evaluation committee's recommendation for Cigna to be the provider for this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3208)|
| 0:53:43| And as we discussed in committees last week, what is before this body is to vote this up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3223)|
| 0:53:57| Vote for or against a contract with Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| If you were to vote it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| then I presume that it would put our administration somewhat back to the drawing board on what to do insurance-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3244)|
| 0:54:15| Well, I have been told in conversations with many of the administrators that since everybody has most of the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3255)|
| 0:54:23| it will be a much shorter turnaround time before we can get something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| And I'm sure they're here, Cigna and Carrington and Blue Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3266)|
| 0:54:34| And I don't know if we need to, you know, come back in 30 days, get back to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| I'm not sure how we need to approach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| I talked to Hugh Holt, I think, last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| And if we voted this down, I think he was going to have his folks ready to send the bids back out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| and asking everybody to bid, all the services inclusive, I guess, is a good word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| And that way we know what it's going to cost instead of bidding something out after we approve this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| Like the reinsurance rate or there you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| So I think if we vote this down today, then Mr. Holt, I see him making his way to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| And I think we have some employees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| Do you all have, is there an employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Do you want to speak on the insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| You can come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| And then we'll get to Mr. Holt after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3335)|
| 0:55:43| First, I'd like to express my appreciation on behalf of the Knox County employees as a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| to allow me to express their concerns today on their health, care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| and the process of choosing a carrier to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| I stand here representing almost 70% of Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| from the offices of the sheriff, the trustee, the registrar of deeds, the circuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| general sessions, juvenile and child support clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| Knox County clerk, and the criminal court clerk office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| We as a collective group of employees submit these signatures on this petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| asking for the insurance to go out for a rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| This effort has been an employee-based initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| Even though approximately a year ago, Knox County faced this same situation and it was resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| we find ourselves here today with the same issues and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| Who will the carrier be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| What will the premiums be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| What is my coverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| And finally, where is the insurance accepted both inside and outside the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| These questions and many more remain unanswered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| Many employees already have had to pay out of pocket because of lack of coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| Or even worse, some have been denied for procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| Knox County teachers, state and federal employees, city fire and police have a collective bargaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| Knox County employees only have you, the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| The vast majority of county employees make $45,000 or less a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| These are the dedicated employees that show up daily, do their jobs, and they need their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3444)|
| 0:57:32| Many are single-parent homes, either widowed or divorced, struggling to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| Good health benefits and coverage is a necessity for all Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| Last year, employees in the circuit court clerk's office chose to pay more for keratin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| because of the coverage and what their doctors would accept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| that percentage being almost 85% of those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| Blue Cross Blue Shield has previously been a carrier for Knox County when they were self-insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| This given Blue Cross Blue Shield the experience needed for the county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| Employees were also very satisfied both with the insurance and their coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| Blue Cross Blue Shield is not only accepted statewide but within this country and many foreign countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| As stated before, several employees are at a crossroads today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| with a decision on a family member or themselves because of lack of coverage or not being in the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| Now is the time for Knox County employees to know that you, the commission, are listening to their concerns and issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| We ask you to vote no on this proposal and send it back out to rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| The almost 70% of county employees represented by this petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| cite the greatest problem with this proposal is lack of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| and lack of representation on the evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| The time is now to change the process and make it more equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| In doing so, we also ask that the appointed evaluation committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| be expanded from the original members to 11 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| to include two employees from the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| one respectively each from the trustee, the registrar of deeds, the circuit court clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| the county clerk and the criminal court offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| Instead of the decision being made and then informing the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| the employees should be a part of the decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| Once again, we ask you to vote no on the insurance proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| send it back to rebid and to expand the evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Mr. Wheeler, go over that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| Two from the sheriff's department, one from the trustee, one from the registrar of deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Let me find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| It was two from the sheriff, one from the trustee, one from the registrar of deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| one from the circuit court clerk's office, one from the county clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| and one from criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| We don't have a motion on the floor, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| We turn down the proposal today and we add those members to the committee on the insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3612)|
| 1:00:23| and have them bring us back a new proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Second by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Mr. Holt, do you want to say anything today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| Hugh Holt, Deputy Director of Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| I just want to let you know that the proposal process takes a minimum by code 21 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| and that's not the largest amount of time we'll be spending in the evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3643)|
| 1:00:51| And keep in mind that our current insurance expires on December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3651)|
| 1:00:58| Get ready to get busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| I'm always busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| Mr. Chair, Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| I know there are people here from Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Would you all stand up wherever you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| And people here from Carrington, would you all stand up wherever you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| Those are our two providers right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| And Blue Cross Blue Shield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| They're not our current provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Our two providers right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Do any of you all have any trouble going another month on this or another two months if that's what it takes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| I don't think it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| I just want all the employees to know that nobody's going to lose any insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| Karen's already said that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Cigna said it and Carrington said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Commissioner Cate, I do not believe there are any legal provisions in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| or in the charter that would allow us to extend it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| I have spoken to Mr. Owings and I defer to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3709)|
| 1:01:57| If need be, I'll make that two different resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| We'll just draw a resolution to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| I'll withdraw, ask that we withdraw this resolution to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| and then put a substitute resolution to ask that we add those members to the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3726)|
| 1:02:14| and bring us back a new proposal if that's what I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| I think first we need to vote it down, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| We can withdraw without objection if that's what this, or we can vote it to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| Come on down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| Give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| Sean Hughes with Cigna Healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| I'm actually based out of Nashville, Tennessee, but I also support the Knoxville market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| We'll be supportive of whatever the decision is here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| but did want to state from a timing standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| if the issue is bringing in the other departments to score it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| wouldn't it be in the best interest of everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| We were all asked to give a best and final from a rate standpoint, your network, your service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| your discount guarantees, all that was provided as a best and final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| I believe the date was July 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| Wouldn't it be better to bring those additional evaluators in to score the proposals that are already in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| Because I kind of look at it, we had the lowest cost proposal on the table, the lowest cost to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| the largest network, the best service that was provided by the scoring system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| I mean, our numbers are public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| It kind of really puts Cigna at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| When we were asked to bring our best and final, we brought it to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| We were the lowest to the county, the lowest to the taxpayers, the lowest to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| The benefits I can't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| The county sets the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| You know, it's just Cigna's job to actually administer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| So I have no problem if you want to do a complete re-bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| and I'm not sure how long it will actually delay the process, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| But I would think in the interest of time so the employees are not impacted to actually re-score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| or add the actual evaluation committee, add the members, and re-score what's already in house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| I think one of the issues is, like, the reinsurance rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| And the reinsurance rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| And that you all, we're not going to bid it until November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| The bids are in for the reinsurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| But they're not in this proposal we're seeing today, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| We have final numbers, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| And I wasn't at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| My colleague, Mike Craze, was at the meeting on Friday when the bids were opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| And guys, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe Cigna was the lowest again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| I think what I want to say, and, I mean, I'm just one person out of 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| is that it's bid all together and come back who's got the lowest bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| You have the lowest bid for the ASO, the disease manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| But we're not talking, I think that when the evaluation committee meets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| the way you score 25% or something like this, just come back with your final best offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| That's what all carriers have already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| I mean, all carriers were asked to give a best and final at a firm rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| including the stop loss, which was due on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| And all carriers gave their best and final on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| And, again, Cigna had the lowest rate on the table for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| But only price, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| How much did price carry in the evaluation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| The evaluation scored in accordance with the Knox County Purchasing Code was 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| So there's 75% outside of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| Yeah, and that was agreed to by the full health insurance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| which included the county clerk, included a representative of the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| included the trustee, and included the registrar of deeds on the health insurance committee from the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| And they also approved the benefit plan before it went out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| And it approved the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Well, those are probably one person from each of those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| And we have a petition with, it appears, it's probably 400 or 500 names on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| So, you know, we want to make things more open and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3951)|
| 1:05:58| This is one we're going to get started with, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| How much more open you can be than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| Well, I think the problem is the committee who recommended this sent it out to the other committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| And I don't know the name of the first committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| You only had, what, four people on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| Yeah, there was five, four actually voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Who was on the first committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| The first committee included Larry Smith, Wally Welch, Billy Tindall, Chief Bivins, Tim Green, Tony Norman, Fred Sisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3982)|
| 1:06:31| No, I think there was another committee before that, wasn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| Dr. Canada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| John Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| They weren't another committee that voted to send it to this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| The evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| The evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| So how many people was on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| The evaluation committee had five people, including Larry Smith, Brian Bernard, Francis Fogerson, John Williams, and Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| Larry Smith recused himself because of the time involved and was replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| Brian Bernard did not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| Mr. Chairman, I'm still confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| We had one committee with a 4-4 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| That was a final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| That's a full health insurance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| So 4-4 under Robert's Rules of Order is a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| So we have no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| We have an evaluation committee that's been assigned to this request for a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| And the evaluation committee went through the detail of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| and evaluated all the work that the carriers have submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| went through all the details and came up with a scoring that was agreed upon beforehand from the larger committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| And the vote in that committee was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| And we sought advice from John Owings where to proceed from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| And he might be able to enlighten me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| The purchasing regulations speak to an evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| The evaluation committee consisted of the people that John just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| It's the evaluation committee that made the recommendation, the unanimous recommendation, I guess you could say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| It then went to the health insurance committee, which had a 4-4 tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| So as far as our purchasing regulations, if you look at those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| the evaluation committee evaluates the proposals and makes the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4105)|
| 1:08:32| The committee that was charged with recommending to us is the 4-4 tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4112)|
| 1:08:40| Health insurance committee was a 4-4 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| There were three persons on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| One may have recused himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| One commissioner, I believe, did not participate in the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| And there was another person that did not end that meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| So it ended up in a 4-4 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| The evaluation committee, though, for the purpose of a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| I believe you have to look at the evaluation committee because that is who scored the proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4150)|
| 1:09:17| And that's what our purchasing regulation speaks to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| Did we appoint the 4-4 committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| I think the health insurance committee appointed the evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| We've got Doug Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Did you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4178)|
| 1:09:58| If you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| Doug Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| I work for Carrington Health Care, Chief Operating Officer, 10324 Castle Bridge Court, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4203)|
| 1:10:12| Just a couple of points as you went through the costs that you were discussing here briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| To make it clear, one of the purchases in this contract is also your contracts with your providers for discounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| And no matter how you evaluate the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| whether you look at it based on guarantees that the bidders made for those discounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| including or excluding those discounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| but making sure that you evaluated fairly using those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| Carrington by far had the lowest bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| If you look at provider discounts, we guaranteed, I'll just tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| 57% discounts from the provider at our full admin, Cigna guaranteed it at 50.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4251)|
| 1:11:00| and Blue Cross guaranteed it at 52.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| If my discounts were put at their level, our admin fee only would be 50% less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4264)|
| 1:11:11| So Carrington clearly was the lowest cost bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| In the case of the 57% discounts, 4.3 million compared to one and 5.6 to the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| And cost is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| If you look at the stop loss quote, 60% of the scoring is based on cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| yet it's a half a million dollar contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| This is a 54 million dollar contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| This is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| It needs to carry the right and fair amount of weight to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| It seems to me that this committee, the evaluation committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| and the health committee has spent a lot of time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| I mean, this is not something that they did over one luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| I mean, it's my understanding that there were several meetings, a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| The companies that came and presented their proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| they obviously spent a lot of time and a lot of effort putting the pencil to paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| and making sure that they had what they felt was their best bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| And so now here we are, and I must tell you that just in listening to the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| and myself included, that I'm a bit confused myself as to what the proposals are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4335)|
| 1:12:21| and what the best proposal would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| And we obviously want the very best for our citizens who work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| And so I guess the two points that I'd like to make are these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| Point number one is if we're going to redo this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| it should be a very clear and transparent process as to what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| Are we going to just re-bid and take these things that we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| like has been mentioned, the figures that we already have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Is it going to be a complete re-bid process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| And if we do that, what will the re-bid process be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| Who will be evaluating this and who will be making the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| The second thing is, as Mr. Wheeler mentioned, we as the commission have to make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| I would like to see a workshop, once this committee has its work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| rather than presenting it here when we're under, frankly, some time constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| is let's really sit down and go over these proposals once this committee has done their evaluations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| and they've done what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Let's have a workshop, non-mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Let's come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Let's ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Let's have them present us with the information so we have adequate time to answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| The third point I'd like to make is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| I have my insurance through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| Will I be covered after December 31st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| That question hasn't been answered yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| Will we be covered after December 31?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| We are bringing a proposal today that would cover you past December 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| But if we don't do this proposal and if we vote it down, will we be covered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| If we have to go through the 21 days, then the evaluation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| and we get in and we can't get everybody done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| I mean, if this is voted down today, will there be insurance January 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| You're assuming that the re-bid gets approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| If the re-bid does not get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| I mean, I'm saying if we get involved in politics again and we get mired down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| and we can't get a decision by January 1 or we can't get all the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| I'm just trying to think ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| For the employees' sake, myself included, will we have the insurance if we get bogged down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| and we can't have a decision to get everything processed by January 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| I mean, the executive branch can't enter into a contract without the legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| From the conversation up here, I don't think that's going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| Will the providers be willing to extend another 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| I guess that's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| The law director has already opined on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| And the law director has said, what was the opine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| I don't believe I have opined on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| I don't recall it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| That's why I was asking what the opine was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| Are you talking about extending the current contract that we have right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| For 30 days or 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| You know, we think about this for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| This past year, when we re-approved that contract that we have now, that each of us have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4511)|
| 1:15:21| that was done on an emergency basis, I believe, was it not, Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| What's the emergency here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| I don't know that I see the emergency as we sit here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| And you could certainly speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| So could we extend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| The answer is probably no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| Mr. Hugo, is there not something that we could do, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| Is there not something we could have a ten-day bid process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| We could shorten it to a 14-day with the approval of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| And I think that's, if this commission votes it down today, I think I'd go with the 14-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| So it would give us more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| Because you've got the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Everybody should have their numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Yes, but the way the code reads, we cannot take that current data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4564)|
| 1:16:11| and bring it over and use it in another evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| We can look at ways of streamlining because we already have information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| and we know some of the things that we didn't know before we started this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| But I just can't allow them to take the data that we have and say, use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4584)|
| 1:16:31| That's not consistent with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| But the mayor would agree if this votes down today to go with the 14-day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| But, you know, we went through this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| Someone's not going to be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| I share the sentiment that we do want the absolute best product we can get for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| that our citizens can afford to pay through their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| But we're finding ourselves back up against a wall again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| And we're going to work with you the very best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| And certainly I will approve the 14-day if that's what it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| Without question, I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| But to think that it's just a matter of rushing and getting back through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| You know, we went through this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| We had the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| We worked with Mr. Owings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| I appreciate him working with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| This year, that's not an option, if I'm correct, John, to keep extending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| So we really, if we don't do something quickly and you approve it relatively quickly after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| then we run the real risk of not having insurance on January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| We've got to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Mr. Law Director, if this were an emergency, I think I read between the lines that we could extend the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4650)|
| 1:17:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| We did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| But we shouldn't be placing ourselves in an emergency situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| And I couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| I'm saying if we get there, I just want the employees to understand that while I don't have a crystal ball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| I'll give you eight to five, there's 13 people around this table that will put that on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| It's hard to, you know, to, you've got things coming from Keratin, HC21, La Crosse Blue Shield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| and all of them are cheaper, but, you know, I'd like to see next year for them, for us to bypass, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4689)|
| 1:18:16| a health care committee if we can and come straight to commission with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| If we have to have a workshop, let's have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| But let us understand the numbers since we're the ones voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| You know, I've got things here from Keratin telling me that they're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars cheaper than Cigna or Blue Cross Blue Shield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| And I have Cigna standing up here telling me that they're the cheapest, that they've come in the cheapest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| So I think we need to have a workshop on this to bring all those numbers to us so we can understand them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| and we can ask the questions and get, we've all got a lot of information on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| so let's study up and have a workshop and ask the questions that we need to ask to find out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| who is going to be best for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| And I couldn't agree that I think we do need a workshop on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| And if whoever is on the health care committee, Mr. Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| whoever worked with us that we could call a special meeting if you'd give us some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| because we had to have ten days, and to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| and when Jolie calls you that you understand it would be for a workshop for health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4757)|
| 1:19:25| So we'll go to Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| This is directed back to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| I guess I really failed to understand why this commission could not, if this thing is voted down today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4775)|
| 1:19:46| that we could then add a resolution today that may take a two-thirds vote to get on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| it may take a two-thirds vote to approve, that if the carriers are willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| that they could not be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| And I get a reading from the law department that if this, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| this contract is voted down in one form or another, I assume we have an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4805)|
| 1:20:13| If we have an emergency, then could we then, if the party is willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| that they would extend it a month or two months, whatever it would take to keep it gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| Because I, you know, to say we can't do it kind of is an answer that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4823)|
| 1:20:31| Well, here we are, and it is September, what is today, the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| Last year, I believe, we were down to within days, I know it was within a week of the deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4836)|
| 1:20:46| which truly was an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| And that's why we did what we did today as of September the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| You know, I don't see this as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| Are you saying we can delay it for 30 days or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| I mean, I guess in deference to commission, and this is not faulting anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4864)|
| 1:21:12| it's just kind of stating here that something presented to the commission that basically says you must approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| and give us very little leeway of being able to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| One thing we need to protect is our right to be able to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| And kind of what I'm hearing here is that we don't really have the right to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| Whether that's a good decision or a bad decision is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| But on any type of decision, I think we need to hear people and be able to vote either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4896)|
| 1:21:47| I think it was discussed at committee meetings the other day that it would have been nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| if it could have been brought to the commission maybe a month earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| For whatever reason, that wasn't possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| It's, you know, we're at the stage now where we have certainly followed our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4921)|
| 1:22:08| We followed it as, from what I can tell, as closely to the letter as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| It is before this body on September the 24th for an up or down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| If you vote it down, Hugh Holt goes back to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| and he's got a short time frame in which to complete the next proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| So that's where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| It's still not an emergency, not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| I think what the law director is probably saying, if we vote this down today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| then we got into December 20th and didn't have insurance for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| then I think that would be an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| And I think one of the carriers last week said that they would be willing to extend the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4965)|
| 1:22:53| So I think today we just got to decide to vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| And we've got a motion on the floor to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| To deny and then also to send this back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| including the names that are the people from the different departments that Tim Wheeler had suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4984)|
| 1:23:12| And it was two from the sheriffs and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| Two from the sheriff, one from trustee, one from registered deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| one from criminal court clerk, and one from the county clerk and circuit court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=4997)|
| 1:23:26| The evaluation committee also, by our purchasing regulations, needs to include other individuals as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| Yeah, it's just expanding the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| To expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| The other people that was on it stay on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| And it was seconded by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| So I guess Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| I agree with Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Things have gotten kind of confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| We had a health care committee and evaluation committee that came back with some fairly clear recommendations to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5037)|
| 1:24:06| And suddenly there is, at least between the last meeting, between the committee meetings last week and this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5046)|
| 1:24:17| there's suddenly been the issue of non-representation of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5057)|
| 1:24:25| And that was not an aspect of the process, or that was not a problem, at least to the committee that I was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5065)|
| 1:24:35| So, to me, that seems like a confusing point right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| And so I would like for somebody, maybe Matt Myers, he's one of the guys carrying the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5080)|
| 1:24:48| if he would respond to some of this, some of the issues such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| Would you mind doing that, Matt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| Or to any other issue that has been brought up here in this meeting that you think is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5098)|
| 1:25:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| I stand before you this afternoon asking for the approval of the self-insured administrative services contract with Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| In seeking your approval, I'm also requesting your acknowledgement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| and gratitude for the fine work that this subcommittee has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| They've worked many hours on this particular project over and above their normal duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| They've worked weekends, nights, on vacations, have canceled vacations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| and done everything humanly possible to bring Knox County a best value procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5131)|
| 1:25:39| The evaluation criteria that were laid out in the RFP were considered by the full insurance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5139)|
| 1:25:47| which had many of these on here, and included initial cost, customer service, and other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| I would like to let you know that the recommendation from the committee was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| As an introduction to what is before you today, Knox County is moving to a self-insured program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| Being self-insured allows Knox County to take control of our health care cost of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| We now control the benefits provided to the employees instead of adapting to the insurance carrier's benefits plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5171)|
| 1:26:18| Knox County now keeps the premiums in our bank account instead of allowing carriers to gain interest on our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| Knox County is now effectively the insurance carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| The administrative services portion of this equation, what you are voting on today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| is simply to pay the claims based on our benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| Our charge was to conduct an open competitive process with our multiple constituencies in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| those being the Knox County employees, the office holders as employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| and the taxpayers who pay the majority of these costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| Our charge has been successfully completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| During the presentations from the three proposers under consideration, I asked the same question to each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| How do you feel the process went?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| Some comments were, we have not had any complaint at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| We had a very concrete document that we could respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| And you guys have a game plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| Copies of those transcriptions have been included in some of the information that you were given today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| I want you to keep in mind that we are not buying a commodity such as a vehicle or office supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| This is a service consisting of more than just a price for an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| In the private sector, companies have the luxury of simply choosing who they wish to do business with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| In the public sector, we have strict guidelines that define our expenditure of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| as well as regulations for soliciting bids and requests for proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| In my job as a procurement official, I make decisions based on facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| And each and every time, someone is successful as well as unsuccessful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| This is the way public procurement operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| It is a fair way to operate and keeps the integrity of the bid and RFP process intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5274)|
| 1:28:04| It is also the way you, as a legislative body, have directed me to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5284)|
| 1:28:10| Not approving this contract is telling vendors that if you don't like the outcome of a bid or RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| talk to someone who is an elected or, in this case, appointed official, and it can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| Knox County is under enough scrutiny now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| We don't need or want any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| The process that was followed was the same as for any other process that is issued from the purchasing division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| There are statements or misconceptions that the process was flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| I respectfully take exception to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| All proposers had the opportunity, as stated in Section 1.3, 1.18, 3.3, 3.14, and 3.18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5319)|
| 1:28:49| to voice complaints or issues regarding any language or section contained within the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| There was also a pre-proposal conference that was held in which questions could be raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| There were no questions raised regarding the evaluation criteria, the scoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| or any other provisions contained within the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| As mentioned before, all three spoke favorably about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| but only after being unsuccessful was it time to cry foul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| As for the perfect company, it does not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| Somewhere in time, you can find fault with each of the finalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| Sometime in the future, another issue will arise with whoever is our contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| No company is without error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| All three companies that were considered finalists are excellent companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| and I commend them for the way they have handled themselves up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| As an employee myself, I will have to re-enroll my family in the new insurance provided to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| as will all of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| During this process, I have learned that Knox County government pays a tremendous amount of the percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| of the cost associated with health care, to which I'm grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| I also want to keep that cost as low as possible as I'm a taxpayer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| I see no reason to pay more and get less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| But not approving the contract before you today is nullifying a good business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| My job is to make a best value procurement for Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| That is what I'm paid to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| I find it very interesting that as the process unfolded and I personally met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| as well as members of the subcommittee with some of the elected appointed officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| to keep them abreast about what was going on and the changes to be anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| that everyone was voicing approval, sincere approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| You can tell when you're being lied to by someone's eyes and their body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| Then one afternoon I received a tap on my shoulder and I was summoned away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| only to be told that the previous administration made a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| That commitment was supposedly to a company who does not currently do business with Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5452)|
| 1:30:59| Once that conversation was over, it became apparent that the other elected appointed office holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| had been contacted and an agreement was made to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| This is very disheartening to a group that has invested a tremendous amount of time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| to read through each and every proposal and reach an independent, unanimous decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| once again, a best value procurement for Knox County as well as the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| Is it not time to do the right thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| Change is never easy, but it is inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| Knox County is now the insurance carrier, not a keratin, a blue cross or a signet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| We must think about insurance in a completely different manner and press on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| The process was not flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| The best company prevailed and the taxpayers have the lowest cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| Once again, we have given you a best value procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| What is not to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| Okay, hang on just a minute, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Commissioner Norman, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| I just would urge my commissioners to consider this committee and all the work that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5517)|
| 1:32:05| And I would urge you to accept the recommendations of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| Matt, one question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| I guess if you're self-funded, we've got a board somewhere in Knox County that the employees can, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| file grievance or something with if they get turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| Yeah, there would be an appeals process, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| Now, how do you have that in here written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| I mean, are there people that are elected to it or appointed by the commissioner or the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5551)|
| 1:32:38| I think there would be an appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| It's not been designed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| Do you think that we ought to have that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| if this thing gets turned down to come back with everything in hand instead of coming back piecemeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5566)|
| 1:32:54| That wasn't a part of the request for proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| No, not part of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| But don't you think it's a good idea for us to be able to tell the citizens while we're on this community television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| and the employees how it's going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| And then somebody just decides, well, okay, John Troyer is going to get to pick everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| I mean, who makes that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| I think that would be a decision for the mayor and the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| So I think the employees would like to have that part of when we come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| if this thing gets voted down, to have all this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| Maybe at the workshop we'll be able to figure it all out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| But there's so many unanswered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| The carrier will be the first and second level of appeal, and then it would go to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| Yeah, but we don't know in Knox County who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| Matt, please understand, and Hugh and Mayor and everybody that worked on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| I'm not picking on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| I'm not picking on where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| I have absolutely no interest in who this administrator is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| When an employee tells me that their deductible is going from $250 to $1,200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| and they've got small children, now, it seems like we might be able to do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| I may have to sit here next month and eat a box of crow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| But that's a big jump for a young couple with some children, from $250 to $1,200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| and their premium may be going up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| Now, that's who I'm coming from is employees that have stopped me in the hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| employees that I stopped and talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| I just think there may be a better deal, and I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| And I'll be the first to admit it if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| But other people have told me that, too, including insurance companies that are not involved in this in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| because I've talked to some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| I'm going to let Dr. Fogerson speak to the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| Francis Fogerson, Human Resources Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| Commissioner, when you're speaking about a plan that has a deductible at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| that is one of three plans from which employees can select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| Is it not the cheapest one about what the premiums are now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| So if they keep the deductible at $250?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| We've tried to design the plans so that each of the three plans have premiums that are equivalent to what we have right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5709)|
| 1:35:18| so that no one's premiums should be significantly higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| In fact, we've tried to make them as close as possible so that one of our we will have three PPO plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5723)|
| 1:35:30| One of them will be equivalent to our highest premium plan now, one equivalent to our medium premium plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5730)|
| 1:35:37| and one equivalent to our lowest premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| The premiums are designed so that they are as very, very similar to what employees are paying right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| If you choose to pay a lower premium, then your deductible will be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| My point, I guess part of my point is nobody's bothered to tell the employees this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| They're sitting there going, I'm having a $1,200 deductible, and I can go to a $250 deductible, but it's going to cost me more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| Each year we hold from 20 to 40 informational sessions during the open enrollment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| We deliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| That's after it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| Hold them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Tell people what they're going to be getting now and let them kind of look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| It's a little difficult because it's not approved yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| The point is very few employees have any information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| And I'm not picking on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| I'm just telling you, I've talked to 20 to 23 or 24 of them, and they don't understand what's about to happen, and neither do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5791)|
| 1:36:43| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| I want to defer to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| I know they've had their lights on longer than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| I do want to speak, but I want to defer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| Anybody else you want to call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| You know, here's the bottom line, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| I don't know who picked the insurance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| I think, Mayor, you picked some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| I don't know if commission picked some people on here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| I went to the first meeting, and it was crammed full of people that were supposed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| And we were given our task, what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| And there were commissioners that were on that committee, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| Some commissioner didn't even go up to the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| And every meeting, it got less and less and less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| I carry the insurance myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| Same as a lot of you people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| And I understand a lot of the employees out there, because I've got the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| And what happened, everybody had representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| The sheriff's department had representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| All the office holders, they had representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| And, guys, they quit coming to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| And then the insurance committee that Mr. Troyer, I think you chaired it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| and then they formed a subcommittee, and they worked their tail off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| Guys, you think this is a lot to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| We'd walk out of meetings with huge boxes of stuff to go at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| Our homework was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| What Mr. Meyer said was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| We're looking at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| We're looking at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| It was done fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| And then a lot of the people that didn't win it started spreading rumors to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| That's the oldest sales trick out there in insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| It's get them scared, don't know what to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| No, I understand the employees don't know what they're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| Just like she said, we hadn't voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| The insurance subcommittee that did the evaluation, I'm extremely, extremely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| extremely impressed on how they did it and how unbiased they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| and how they recused themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| I'm licensed with every company myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| I didn't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| I stayed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| I did not know until I came into this room who they awarded it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| And what happened, the word was spread to other office holders that, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| your employee will not be covered here or outside here or there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Things that were just not true, just scare tactics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| The insurance committee has done their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| They found who's the best one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| You know, here we go again, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| We're not looking sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| This is another thing that the county commission is screwed up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| The subcommittee has done their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| They've made their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| And if we take the time and look at it, we don't need to hold a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| We've been working on this for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| And they've come up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| They've got a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| There's a lot of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| They didn't even talk about the benefits, the pluses and minuses that are going to be added to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| The benefit package that they're coming, it's an awesome package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| Employees, you're going to like what you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| Well, you're going to see some things added to your accounts, nonsmokers discounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| I'm extremely proud of what they came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| You know, the insurance company didn't say, all right, we're going to give you this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| The Knox County employees went to the insurance committee, insurance carriers, said, this is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6006)|
| 1:40:13| And here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| We're just delaying it again and delaying it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| You know, I could care less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| I'm going to take the insurance, who we get it with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| I will take the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| But it's just a slap in the face to that committee, and it just appalls me that the committee people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| the commissioners, they didn't even show up to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| You know, and then you jump, oh, well, we can't vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| This isn't right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| Well, guys, you should have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| I think maybe the employees might disagree with you here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| Well, they had representation there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| Every officeholder had representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| Mr. Harb, give us your names just so they can have it for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| Sam Harb, Knox County Trustee's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| And I promise you, members of the commission, if you had county employees on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6052)|
| 1:41:00| I promise you we'd have been there with bells on our feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| The officeholder sent representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| I disagree with my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| You know, he thinks we're making a mistake if we don't ram this thing down the employee's throat today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| I think we need to take time, and I think we need to re-bid this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| And here's what I wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| For the third time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| That's the third time we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| Well, Larry, how do we keep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| Commissioner Lambert has the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| How do we keep ending up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Well, I've gotten a lot of calls from employees saying, we want keratin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| I've gotten a lot of calls from employees saying, we want Blue Cross Blue Shield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| Now, I personally don't have a problem with Cigna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| but I have yet to get a single call from an employee saying, we want Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| We want you to vote for this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| We were right at this very same place last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| And I'm going to ask a question that I didn't ask last year, that I don't think was asked last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| because I'll tell you what the employees are saying, and I just want to ask the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| and I don't mean this disrespectfully at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| but the talk out there on the street is that Cigna is connected with an old fraternity friend of yours named Rocky Good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6135)|
| 1:42:26| and I just want to know, is Rocky Good connected to Cigna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| and is there anything going on here, or is this simply what this committee really thinks is the best plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6151)|
| 1:42:41| And I'm just asking the question, is Rocky Good connected with Cigna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| No, Rocky Good has been advising us on all of the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| If he's connected with anybody closer, I think if you talked to him, he would say it would be keratin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| So to your assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| Well, no, it's not my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| Well, you asked me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| I'm asking based on what I'm hearing the employees say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| I'm asking a question because I want to clear it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| An emphatic no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| Here's what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| Last year we went through the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| We went out, we looked at the best plan we could, and we came back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| It was not accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| While we find ourselves in this situation today, whoever has got the best lobbyist has the strongest chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6196)|
| 1:43:22| Now, here's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| Now, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| We're going to work with you the very best way we can, the very best way we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| regardless of what your decision is, to have the best insurance we can for our employees at the best cost for our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6211)|
| 1:43:39| That's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| I think the people who have worked on this have worked very hard, very fairly, to do an absolutely excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| If you turn this down today, we'll do the best we can the next time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| We're not here to sabotage any process, but your comment is completely untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| Well, it's a question, not a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| And I just want to say that I have talked to one lobbyist in one conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| but I have talked to about 50 employees saying that they want this thing to be rebid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| and it's just hard for me to vote for this thing when the folks that are going to be receiving these insurance benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6251)|
| 1:44:19| seem to me to be overwhelmingly against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| Commissioner Pinkson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| Mr. Owens, we had two committees, but did I understand you to say the evaluation committee was the only one that could vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6270)|
| 1:44:37| The evaluation committee, according to our purchasing regulations, is the committee that both grades and makes the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6277)|
| 1:44:48| Well, why do we even have these other committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| This commission apparently set up the committee on health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6291)|
| 1:44:57| and I don't know to study it further I would think would have been the objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6297)|
| 1:45:05| Well, listen, Commissioner Smith here, I can understand why people didn't go to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6305)|
| 1:45:11| If I didn't have a vote, there would be no need for me to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| I mean, what input would I have on it other than study it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| I'm going to make a suggestion to this commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| If we defer this or vote it down, I think we should charge Mr. Smith with the responsibility of coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| and showing us the difference in these policies since he knows so much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| You know, show us the difference in the good policies and the bad policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| You've told us you were in the insurance business, and you've studied all this, and it's a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| I'm going to charge you, and I'd like for the rest of this commission to charge you with the responsibility of coming to us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| I'll be selling you life insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| I said I'll be selling you life insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| You couldn't sell me anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| I'm going to say you're not implying that he needs life insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| All right, we've got to get on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| I would like to add in a friendly amendment to the motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| I believe we do need a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| I know I need a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6366)|
| 1:46:07| I received phone calls from all of the companies this week wanting to meet with me to go over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| and I wish that I could have had the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| This is probably the worst week in the year to try to sit down with people and go over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| because I think everybody knows what we're involved with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| But I would like to add a friendly amendment that if, indeed, this is voted down, that we do have a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6382)|
| 1:46:28| that these evaluation committee or the health committee come to us, make a formal presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| give us an adequate opportunity to ask questions, evaluate and look at it, and make our decision then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| And I think we can do that pretty quickly after this evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| I don't know if the sponsors of the amendment would or the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Mr. Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| I would also like to encourage Cigna, Blue Cross and Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| I mean, there's a lot of smart people that work in those three companies in insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| and I would like to encourage them to try to come back and help the county understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| whichever way that works, that be innovative, be creative, get out in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| And I'll bet you, Commissioner Smith, at the end of the day we'll come up with a better mousetrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| But you've not even seen what they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| They have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| The committee has come up with a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| I'm not saying they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| I'm telling you that the employees don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| And they don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| Employees haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| We should vote something in for the employees that they haven't even seen or know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| Commissioner Lambert, call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| I think we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| Mr. Troyer, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| I just want to comment that one of the benefits of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| and one of the things that the health insurance committee agreed upon early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| is that the county should go into a self-insured program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| and that way the county could decide its benefit and options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| I don't think there's nobody disagreeing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| I just want to make sure that it would be the county chooses the benefit options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| Mr. Chairman, will you state the motion before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| The motion is to deny 901| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| and add the additional members from the sheriff, trustee, register of deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| and criminal court clerk, county clerk, and circuit court clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| and that we'll have a workshop as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| after the evaluation committee comes out with their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6503)|
| 1:48:29| I have a question on those committees, because some of those office holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| the staff committee, are you adding more on top of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| We're making an 11-member board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| It's additional to what's on there currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| What about the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| Say you had somebody from the sheriff's department that's already working on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| Is that person going to stay on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6522)|
| 1:48:47| Tim, you had an 11-member board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6527)|
| 1:48:58| Subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| So on the original committee, John Troyer, who was on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6540)|
| 1:49:06| The evaluation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| No, on the one committee that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| The health insurance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| Not everybody, but the one that did the procurement, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| The smaller committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| The smaller committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| The smaller committee included Larry Smith, Brian Bernard, Francis Fogerson, John Williams, and Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| And to that committee, we're going to add two more from the sheriff's office, one from the trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| one from registered deeds, one from criminal court clerk, one from the county clerk, and one from circuit court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6571)|
| 1:49:38| What about property assessor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6578)|
| 1:49:45| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| Add one from the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6586)|
| 1:49:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| All in favor to deny resolution 101, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| We'll do it by roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| Start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| Commissioner Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6611)|

| 1:51:28| Is this part of the, should this be part of the package deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| This can be independent of the carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6693)|

| 1:52:39| On page 19, Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| This is adopting the Stormwater Management Ordinance on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6762)|
| 1:52:49| Let me get through this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6769)|

| 1:52:54| On page 19, Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6774)|
| 1:53:00| On first reading or second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6780)|

| 1:53:14| Motion made by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| Commissioner Cate, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| Thank you for recognizing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| Yes, on this motion here, I would like to make a substitute motion or amendment to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| in that we raise the penalty to $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| And I'd also like to talk to the commissioners here about making it a working or living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| If I could get a second on that, I'd explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| You know, there's tons and tons of hours that went into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| You know, you have to recognize everybody that's been a party to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| But, you know, we've drawn such battle lines and postcards through the mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| and I apologize for the people that have not been able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| It was effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| And I got over 107 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| And I don't know how accurate it was, but nevertheless, I want to recognize everybody that's done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| And I think battle lines have been drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| I don't see the vote changing very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| And I would like to say we need to increase the penalty to $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| I had some web-based information that the city was $50,000 to the $5,000 mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6875)|
| 1:54:42| I find that strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| You know, so we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| But the $250,000 is what I think that maybe with the battle lines drawn that we can pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| As far as keeping this document open for the ones that might be disappointed in how that we move this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6893)|
| 1:54:59| is I'd like to recommend a timeline, maybe nine months, that we bring it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| and study this and see the progress that's been made, the fines that's been issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6904)|
| 1:55:11| the good contractors versus the bad contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| and the things that we need to stiffen and make this a better document than what we might pass today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6914)|
| 1:55:22| We keep this open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| And that's my motion before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| And I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| I mean on the living document part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| You said that I want to make sure that that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| That's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| Well, I guess it's just really adding to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| That's an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| That's an amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| And there was a second, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| Who made the motion first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| I thought I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| That's why I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| If it's a friendly amendment and Commissioner Lambert accepts it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| That's what I'm asking is do I need to accept it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| Or you don't have to accept it and then he'd have to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| I'm offering it as a friendly amendment at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| Six is one, half a dozen is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| I'll accept it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| The second accepts it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| You can make it as a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| You can do a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| But if he accepts it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| Right now it's accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| He accepts it and I accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| Let him make that as a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| Meaning you deny as a friendly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| I see that it's friendly, but I think it would be best, since it is so different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| that it be made as a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| As a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| Then I'm going to bring it as a substitute motion at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| It doesn't have to be a substitute motion to the entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| It's just an amendment to the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| It's a substitute motion rather than an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| John, could we get some more clarity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| Let's let the law directorate of our people talk and we're not going to get through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| Basically he's moved to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| This is an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| And it's been properly seconded as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| Does that change the document so much that it would go back to first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| And you said that the penalty, the fines, were $50 to $5,000, and that came out of the city ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| That's on the web base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| Mr. Weatry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| Unless there's been a change that I've not been aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| the only change that we have made or the amendments that have been made and may have escaped us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7052)|
| 1:57:38| is the minimum that we're going to charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| The ordinance before you should be $50 to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| The change that was made previous was to make the minimum fine $1,000, but still there's a $5,000 limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7067)|
| 1:57:54| There needs to be that upper limit in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| In order for us to be compliant with our NPDES permit, we need the upper limit to go to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| And to be quite frank with you, in some situations, a $250 fine isn't going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7082)|
| 1:58:08| It's going to need to be on the higher end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| When we have a violator who continues to violate the ordinance and does environmental damage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| it needs to be on that $5,000 end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| Well, I think Commissioner Bowler was $250 to $5,000, wasn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| That would work perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| Getting a higher standard to pass today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| I'm not quite sure where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| If this is an amendment, or are we just changing that one part of what we approved before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| I think we've decided it's an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| I thought it was a, it's not a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| It's a plain old amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| Even if I don't accept them, it won't go to a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| It would be voted on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| We'll have two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| So we need to vote on this amendment before we go back to any other consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| I just want to know that I can, we've come back to it after this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7147)|
| 1:59:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| You what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| I consider this version as has been depicted in the media, a watered down version of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7167)|
| 1:59:36| that is not in agreement with, is not in agreement or is not in line with our agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7176)|
| 1:59:44| urban growth agreement with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| So that being said, I'd like, of course, several amendments to take place to this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7186)|
| 1:59:55| but I do have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| The amendments were forwarded by Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| And so I do have a few questions for Mr. Lambert about those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| One, could you, did you write the amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| Actually, I asked an attorney to write them for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| Do you understand the amendments that were written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| The only two amendments that made it this far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| and I've willingly accepted that the others were not successful last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| So the two amendments we're talking about is allowing the engineers to determine what type of pipe is used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7232)|
| 2:00:40| and not restricting it to one material and to allow Mr. Weitrich to have some flexibility in his fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7240)|
| 2:00:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| The original ordinance, as approved by the Public Works Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7250)|
| 2:00:57| did not provide for variety in terms of materials on those critical aspects of the stormwater system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7257)|
| 2:01:10| where we have permanent liability for damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7270)|
| 2:01:16| Now, so would you explain why you think that that's not necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7276)|
| 2:01:23| Well, first of all, I believe that concrete pipe is an excellent material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| but it is not the only material that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| I think that some of these modern plastic pipes, in some ways, are even better than concrete pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7291)|
| 2:01:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| Even regarding the issue of installation and inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| Well, I believe that nobody is advocating that anything be improperly installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| If you don't properly install anything, it's going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| And I don't think anybody is advocating that we allow folks to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| but properly install their plastic and galvanized or even their concrete pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| So how would you ensure that every single instance of another material be properly installed and inspected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| Is that within our ability in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| I think that it is very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| Is that true, Mr. Wheatry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7337)|
| 2:02:23| I would not represent to you that we're going to be at every single pipe installation in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| That's not practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| That's impossible, isn't it, Mr. Wheatry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| It certainly would not be practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| We're going to have a spot inspection so that if someone tries to install something in an improper way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7353)|
| 2:02:42| that there's a very good chance they may well be caught in one of these spot inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| That is also true, not to characterize it as spot inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| similar to the inspection we do on house construction and commercial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| I mean, there are certain things that we can inspect and be there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| There are certain things that we can't be there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| On a couple of so given, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| given your argument against the exclusiveness of a concrete pipe in certain situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7386)|
| 2:03:13| I have nothing against concrete pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| Concrete pipe is a very good product that's very applicable in certain situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7396)|
| 2:03:22| But I do not believe that it is always the only product that is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7402)|
| 2:03:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| So what about that issue as regard to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| and our agreement with the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| How can we come into agreement with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| We made that agreement in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| I think that this is far more stringent than the city of Knoxville was in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7422)|
| 2:03:49| We made an agreement to abide by their old ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| and they have strengthened them since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| I think that we are more than in compliance with the agreement that we signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| when we go back to their ordinance at the time they assigned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| I also do not believe that the material that is used has anything to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7446)|
| 2:04:12| with how well the water is carried away from where it could do damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7452)|
| 2:04:18| to where it is appropriate for that water to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| I don't think that the materials matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| I also think that when properly installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| especially when we're talking about these high-tech plastic pipes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| that when properly installed, in many ways, they are even stronger than concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| In fact, if we wanted to be exclusionary and pass an ordinance that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7475)|
| 2:04:41| you can't use concrete, you can only use properly installed plastic pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| or PVC pipe or carbon fiber pipe or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| we're going to be using in a few years as new products come online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| I think that we could argue that that was even stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| But air agreement is as strong as, so I think that even though I am thoroughly convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7498)|
| 2:05:04| that properly installed high-tech plastic pipes are superior to galvanized and concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7504)|
| 2:05:11| I believe that we should allow some flexibility so that air engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| and so that the engineers that work within this industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| can decide what's to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| You've made that point several times, so that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| Would you, would Sam Parnell come to the, do you care to speak on the issue again, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7526)|
| 2:05:43| Could you give a little bit of background, Sam, for the people who don't know you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| My name is, I'm here today as citizen Parnell, a Knox County taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| I do not represent the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| I've lived in Knox County for several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7556)|
| 2:06:01| I worked for the city of Knoxville for several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| Was the director of engineering for the city for a little over 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7566)|
| 2:06:13| Worked in two administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| I'm harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| Would you respond to concrete pipe for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| Well, I have some prepared remarks, but let me try to answer the question about concrete pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| Concrete pipe is a structure in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| It will carry a load no matter what the backfill materials are used around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7591)|
| 2:06:39| whereas other pipe materials are, they depend to some extent on how the pipe is bedded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7599)|
| 2:06:47| In fact, to a great extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| What about your, what about applications of concrete pipe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| You might think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7613)|
| 2:06:58| You might be familiar with water that passes under the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| and sometimes you see a concrete box that is built to let that water pass under the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7622)|
| 2:07:08| I don't think you've ever seen a plastic box or a steel box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| that's put in to pass the water under the road for a permanent installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7633)|
| 2:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| What were the significant applications that you think that concrete should be required in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| There are only three, and that's the water that passes under the roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7647)|
| 2:07:34| the water that's passed through water on a site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| and the third is that the tension and retention pond structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7660)|
| 2:07:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| Only three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Any other location, other pipe materials can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| And other pipe, there are good applications for other pipe materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| It's just when you want a permanent installation, that's where I'm recommending the concrete pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7676)|
| 2:08:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| Thank you, Mr. Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| I've got a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7692)|
| 2:08:13| We need only one, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7693)|
| 2:08:14| We've got to get to personal privilege whenever that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| If it's now, I'll do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| If not, I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7700)|
| 2:08:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| Is Mr. Pete DeLay here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7702)|
| 2:08:29| You know, let me say I've got a great amount of respect for Sam Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| I worked with him very closely when he was with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| I can point out at least one or two other engineers in the audience that would take an opposite position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7716)|
| 2:08:43| This is about money, and make no mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| Your company sent out this flyer, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7729)|
| 2:08:50| Let me read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| It's not too late to stop the Knox County Commission from passing a watered-down stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7732)|
| 2:08:58| Last month, your Knox County Commission ignored the will of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| I didn't realize we'd had a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| Urged them to pass a strong stormwater ordinance, which I believe we've done, or hopefully we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7743)|
| 2:09:11| And it goes on to read, urge them to reverse their vote during this month's reading of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| and tell them the most durable, strongest storm drainage are made of concrete pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7755)|
| 2:09:21| Call your commissioners Lee Trammell and Richard Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| This is unsigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| It appears to be from a taxpayer group, when, in fact, it's from your company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| and it's just about to bottom line, just as those billboards you put up all over town are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7770)|
| 2:09:37| Now, do you consider that to be ethical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| I completely consider that to be ethical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| I am a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| You're a taxpayer in Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| I'm a taxpayer in Knox County, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| We have a manufacturing plant located at 6209 Old Rutledge Pike in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| Why did you not sign this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| Why did you not put your name on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| This is an educational piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| This is a piece of literature that looks like a taxpayer mailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| This is not an advertising piece, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7802)|
| 2:10:04| If it were an advertising piece, I would have been more than willing to put my name on that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| It's an educational piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| To educate the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| I have made no, I have not changed my position, one iota on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| from the time we began discussing it in April to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| I was on the news the Friday before that reached you, absolutely acknowledging that I sent that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7821)|
| 2:10:29| I am a taxpayer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| It is a pocketbook issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| Of course it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| A pocketbook issue for the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| I also have here another bulletin from the Concrete Pipe Association of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| Engineers beware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| Protect your right to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| This is somewhere they were about to outlaw concrete pipes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| so you all were for the options at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| So, you know, I don't appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| I think it's misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| You can have your own opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| I just don't appreciate stuff like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| Sign something if you're going to send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7860)|
| 2:11:03| Commissioner Cate, I absolutely sent that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| I sent it out because I told absolutely the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| The pictures depicted on that are absolutely the type of damage that this county is subjecting itself to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7868)|
| 2:11:14| There are only three applications under the ordinance prior to the amendments offered by Mr. Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| where concrete pipe would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| Those are public roadways, right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| A bunch of which are not under the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7886)|
| 2:11:29| Those are pass-through drainage, similar to Paper Mill Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| As a matter of fact, some of those pictures are of Paper Mill Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| And those are of pipe leaving retention and detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| I certainly understand your position about the new high-tech materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| I'll absolutely acknowledge that there are places for those materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7904)|
| 2:11:49| However, there are also places where the city, by their ordinance, requires concrete pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7909)|
| 2:11:57| I have brought samples of those materials, the high-tech materials, concrete pipe, and metal pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7917)|
| 2:12:04| I'm more than happy to pass those around for people who want to understand what should be under their public roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7924)|
| 2:12:11| I'm very happy to pass these around for people who would like to see what your alternatives are underneath your roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7931)|
| 2:12:18| I'm fully aware of that, Pete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| This, in my mind, is misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| Now, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| We're just going to agree to disagree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| And here's another position where you're urging flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| So, Commissioner Cate, in my mind, the simple issue is that of the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| Who should be looked out after here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| The taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| And I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| But you're saying under right-of-ways, we've got miles and miles and miles of right-of-ways that are not under roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| It's absolutely asinine for somebody to have to spend the extra money to put concrete pipe under there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| Our director of engineering, who I have a tremendous amount of faith in, has flexibility to require it anywhere he feels it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7971)|
| 2:12:59| Those were not his recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| Those were not his written recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| He has the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7983)|
| 2:13:04| Commissioner, who is responsible if those pipe installations fail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7984)|
| 2:13:09| Is it the taxpayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7989)|
| 2:13:10| It would be the taxpayer or perhaps the engineer and the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| So, it's not always the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| Once those have been deeded to the city or the county in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| Well, deeding to the city is another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| Who is responsible if they have been deeded to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| It's the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| My point exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| Well, I consider that misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| I don't appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| And there you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| We started this at 3.30 and I thought we might get done with it, but it may go on over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| Sheriff Jones has invited us down to a press conference dealing with the Berry case, the murder of Jonah Berry, at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8021)|
| 2:13:49| He said it wouldn't take probably ten minutes if we want to go down to the conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8029)|
| 2:13:55| We know how we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| Let's just call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| You've got the amendment on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| I don't know about you, Mr. Lambert, but I didn't have a question about the amendment that could affect how I'm going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8041)|
| 2:14:10| Does this commission want to go to the press conference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8050)|
| 2:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| Well, let's just recess here until the end of the press conference, which will probably be about 4.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8056)|
| 2:14:27| And then we'll come back and finish this or take up zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| Let's take up zonings and then come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| But if you don't care, large chambers is here dealing with one that she added at 9.13, dealing with a grant of $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8072)|
| 2:14:40| Can we go ahead and approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| We're in recess until about 4.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8093)|
| 2:15:09| We'll get back to discussion about Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| I'm not sure where we're at, but, let's see, Commissioner Pinkston's got his light on and Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8114)|
| 2:15:26| I think, Mr. Chairman, we had a call for the question before we left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| Yeah, I'd call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| I would like to call Robert Campbell to the stand first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| Well, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| If we had a call for the question, we need to take a vote on the call for the question, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| I think we had our lights on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| Well, my light should be off, but Craig had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| I think that's where we left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| I just had a question about the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| Is the amendment simply the raising the fine from a minimum of 50 up to 250?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8150)|
| 2:15:58| On up to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| Well, I'm just talking about the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| And then you said something about this sort of making it a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| I'd like to say it brought back to commission on May, our May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| And Lake Bruce gave us this extensive background sort of performance appraisal as to the contractors doing it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8170)|
| 2:16:18| the ones doing it wrong, where we're using PyPAT and actually performance-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8178)|
| 2:16:24| and where we're having problems at that time, then we can adjust this to make it stronger or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8184)|
| 2:16:32| I'd like to see something passed with all these hours and hours put in, and I think that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| it doesn't shut the door today, and I think it involves the citizens as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8197)|
| 2:16:44| I mean, we have that right right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| So I'm just trying to ask, because, Mr. Law Director, we could rewrite this ordinance if it were to pass today this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8206)|
| 2:16:53| We could rewrite the ordinance starting next month on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| And I appreciate you doing that, because I do think, I agree with you, Mr. Ballard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| we do need to get reports, you know, on things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| Are our ordinances and our standards, are they working, are they not, and what we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8227)|
| 2:17:13| I thought nine months would give enough time for, you know, different projects to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8233)|
| 2:17:22| And then maybe after that, every six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| But I wanted to get this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| And that way it sort of leaves the door open to see where we need to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| But I wanted something to assure the people that it's coming back and it doesn't end here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| So what you're asking for is that it would automatically come back before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8255)|
| 2:17:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| Mr. Chairman, if this were to pass, we're still just back to the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8265)|
| 2:17:51| and someone could still make additional amendments to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| Can they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8275)|

| 2:19:22| Could I ask Commissioner Ballard to restate the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| Is he changing the range of civil penalties from a minimum of 250 to a maximum of 5,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8366)|
| 2:19:35| In addition to your revisit the issue, the civil penalties will change from a minimum of 250 to a maximum of 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8375)|
| 2:19:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| Okay, ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| Let me ask Bruce one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| We just had a call for the question on the amendment and you voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| Okay, let me ask him about his amendment or motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| Are you saying from 250 to 5,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| It's a range from $250 to 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8398)|
| 2:20:02| Can we not do like the city's got a 50 to 5,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| Why can't we do it 250?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| That's up to the engineer anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| That's what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| Bruce felt like it was too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| I was trying to hit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| The city's is 50 to 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8414)|
| 2:20:15| We're going to be stronger than the city's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| You can go anywhere between 50 and 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8417)|
| 2:20:24| We've had a call for the question, though, so we've got to vote on the amendment without debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| Oh, we're voting on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8430)|

| 2:20:32| Just the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| That was a call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| That was a call for the question for the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| That wasn't on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| That was just a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| Now we're going to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| Now we're going to vote just on the amendment and then come back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8444)|
| 2:20:51| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| Can you tell us what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| Now, Mr. Law Director, can you explain it to these fine commissioners what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8459)|
| 2:21:06| Right now you're voting on the amendment, and that is Commissioner Ballard's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| And that's all you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| Do you want to tell them what the amendment is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| Because I know that's going to be the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| So we're not voting to accept this version of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| We're just voting to accept Ballard's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| And we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| Whether that passes or fails, you'll still come back to the main motion that's already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8488)|
| 2:21:34| So the amendment is, is it 250 to 5,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| Changing the 50 minimum to 250 minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8498)|
| 2:21:41| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8501)|
| 2:21:42| So that's all we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| While also revisiting it in May, which is a mandatory nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8508)|

| 2:22:57| of civil penalties, but there are still basic flaws with what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| We should know from harsh experience, spot checks are like audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8583)|
| 2:23:08| They don't catch everything, and we've had recent experience with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8588)|
| 2:23:14| We really need the best possible materials on those things that come back to us, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8594)|
| 2:23:21| the three applications in the original version submitted by the engineering department after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8601)|
| 2:23:27| months of input, hearings, consultants, et cetera, was that in three applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8607)|
| 2:23:32| it made economic sense that we should not be penalizing ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| See, what we're really doing is about the taxpayers, first and foremost, because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8618)|
| 2:23:43| the taxpayers who will pay for our gamble that materials used will not fall apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8623)|
| 2:23:51| Reinforced concrete has a good record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| It doesn't depend on this phrase, if installed properly and everything else is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| I think we can do this by the taxpayers by doing it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| Furthermore, we have an obligation to the EPA that we are late in meeting, and in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8645)|
| 2:24:11| to that, we have an obligation to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| Despite Commissioner Lambert's valiant efforts to be an attorney, this is, the city has written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8654)|
| 2:24:22| to us, and has written to us roughly two dozen things that are wrong and insufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8662)|
| 2:24:29| that do not meet our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| We've gotten maybe one of them away, which still leaves 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| We are not doing our obligations, and so I hope that we have learned from the many comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8675)|
| 2:24:42| It's not just the concrete versus the plastic people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| It's the environmental people worried about sediments, and all of us should be environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| We must live down water of someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| In my district, in our district, the district on loan to us from the voters, there are homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8693)|
| 2:25:01| being bought out because of the volume of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| There are EPA questions about the amount of sediment in water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| We have an obligation here to do what's right, and if you're just still on the fence about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8708)|
| 2:25:13| what to do what is right, let me just remind you, the most conservative and most reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8713)|
| 2:25:20| thing to do in the world is never to penalize yourself or to put yourself at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| So let's go with the proven technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| Let's require that in three specific applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| That's a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| You know, the city has six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8732)|
| 2:25:36| We have an existing compromise before us, which was what the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| I didn't like everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8741)|
| 2:25:42| I thought some good things could have been stronger, but let's not go weaker, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| current version is weaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| In the interest, in the name of flexibility, we have introduced weakness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| We have introduced an opportunity for our county to be sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8753)|
| 2:25:57| Haven't we had enough of that, government by lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| If we can take a simple step to keep the EPA off our backs, to keep the city from suing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| us, to do the right thing, why don't we take that step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| We're going to have to take that step by defeating this weakened version of the ordinance so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8769)|
| 2:26:15| we can pass a stronger version of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| Commissioner Ivan Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| I'd like to ask the law director, I know he's talked to the city law department, the outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8782)|
| 2:26:30| of the conversations you all had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8790)|
| 2:26:36| Well, the city law director, Morris Kaiser, sent a letter, and I think we've sent it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8796)|
| 2:26:42| every commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8802)|
| 2:26:43| We've sent it to Bruce Weitrick and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8803)|
| 2:26:48| They have some 23 exceptions to the ordinance as it presently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8808)|
| 2:26:55| Of course, those things are on the table for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8815)|
| 2:26:59| You know what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| And there is a promise in the September the 10th letter, it looks like, from Mr. Kaiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8822)|
| 2:27:10| and that is if the county fails to amend its ordinance, then the city will pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| its available remedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| And I assume that means only one thing, which means that we will be on one end of a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8838)|
| 2:27:27| So you know, whenever I look at our ordinance, as far as defending it, I listen to our engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8847)|
| 2:27:39| who listen to our consultants, and from what they've told us is that they are comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8859)|
| 2:27:48| with our ordinance as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| And so that's what I rely on, and that's what I will rely upon whenever we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| defend this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| Now my next question is to Mr. Wheatridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| I understand you've met with the city's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| Do you care to give us your viewpoints of how you all came up with the 22 or 23 items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8888)|
| 2:28:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8894)|
| 2:28:15| I think when we embarked on this process of the comparison of the two ordinances, a consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8895)|
| 2:28:21| was brought in and the ordinances were compared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| And, again, I'll restate, there was three essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| Essentially, they came up with three things that needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| Their final report said there was a concrete pipe, the county needed to adopt the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| of concrete pipe, primarily within right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| The county needed more inspectors, and they wanted the county to enforce the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8920)|
| 2:28:45| when it was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| The letter you received from the city law department, what they did is they went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8927)|
| 2:28:51| to the ordinance that was in place in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| The ordinance we compared to is the city's current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| It didn't make any sense, certainly to me, that I should go to a document that clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| is outdated, because the city has now adopted amendments to their ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| So I can't really speak to the items they have in that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| I can speak to the fact that we did go through a process where the two ordinances were compared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| These ordinances are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| They are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8959)|
| 2:29:20| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| But what the consultant did is they essentially took the two ordinances and applied them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| a construction site or to a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| And at the end of the day, and I'm paraphrasing for sure, at the end of the day, from a water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| quality standpoint and a water quantity standpoint, they were essentially, there was no measurable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8974)|
| 2:29:40| difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| So that's what the report of the consultant was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| That's what we submitted to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| We put the concrete pipe standard in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| And I need to point out that the consultant's first iteration was that the concrete pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8989)|
| 2:29:55| was not an issue, that the concrete pipe was not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| They changed it in their final report and said, yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| And we adopted that in our ordinance that we submitted to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| And the original amendment that you issued to commission included the three areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9006)|
| 2:30:11| Mr. Parnell spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9011)|
| 2:30:12| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9012)|
| 2:30:13| The original ordinance we submitted to you all requires, essentially requires concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9013)|
| 2:30:18| pipe in the same circumstances that the city's ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| It may be worded differently, but essentially requires concrete pipe in our original submittal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| that we submitted to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| There's been two other revisions since then based on revisions that have come from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| all and coming from the public that we commented on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| So there's two other, essentially, revisions out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| But our original document we submitted to you all essentially required concrete pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9039)|
| 2:30:43| in the very same instances the city did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| Which was amended by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| Initially, I don't believe it was Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| I don't know that he initially, I know his was the last amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| But there was not only Commissioner Lambert, but Commissioner Norman had comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| And Commissioner Harmon had comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| And we incorporated those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| And we had comments from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| And we addressed all those comments at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| I still like Mr. Parnell to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| And I think he had some more presentation he'd like to give to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9071)|
| 2:31:16| Mr. Parnell, can you come up and give us your intake on what it would cost the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9076)|
| 2:31:22| I know, for instance, at your home, your roads fell three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| And we still go back and put metal pipe back in instead of going in and putting concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9085)|
| 2:31:29| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9089)|
| 2:31:30| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| What I'm thinking about, though, is not just that, but the new development that goes in in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9092)|
| 2:31:39| I've got some prepared remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| And I'd like to do those at this time rather than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| Thank you, members of the commission, for the opportunity to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| My name is Sam Parnell, 9029 Shallopard Road, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| I want to address the stormwater ordinance because it's extremely important for responsible quality growth in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9114)|
| 2:32:02| I'm all for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| I'm all for a variety of pipe materials, both temporary and permanent, and the right applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| Knox County needs to grow, but it needs to grow on top of a strong foundation of quality infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9131)|
| 2:32:18| Not the cheapest infrastructure for the lowest price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| We all know you get what you pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| The ordinance as originally proposed required concrete pipe in three, and only three, critical situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9145)|
| 2:32:34| During my tenure as City Engineering Director, I worked together with three different Knox County Directors of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9154)|
| 2:32:42| It was my experience that when Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works prepared construction plans for new roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9162)|
| 2:32:51| and when the City of Knoxville Department of Engineering prepared construction plans for new roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9171)|
| 2:32:56| both agencies always used concrete pipe for roadway crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9176)|
| 2:33:02| That's why it seemed to me the agencies were on a course to be in harmony to require concrete pipe under roadways built by developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9182)|
| 2:33:09| that would be turned over to the taxpayers for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| The amendment by commission to allow any type pipe under roadways was not in harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9194)|
| 2:33:20| As City Engineering Director, I got to know more about stormwater problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9200)|
| 2:33:25| and in particular stormwater pipe, than most people would ever want to care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9205)|
| 2:33:30| And I know that when stormwater pipe fails, property gets damaged, people may be hurt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9210)|
| 2:33:36| washouts occur that are environmental problems due to soil erosion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9216)|
| 2:33:41| and roads get closed due to the washouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9221)|
| 2:33:45| It's bad for taxpayers, and it's bad for businesses, and it's bad for the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9225)|
| 2:33:51| As I explained in my September 11th letter to commission, this is a risk management issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9231)|
| 2:33:59| When a commission allows any type pipe in public rights of way under the roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9239)|
| 2:34:04| and that pipe fails, injured parties are going to want to hold someone accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9244)|
| 2:34:09| and may want to sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| They're likely to sue the county, since the county allowed the pipe by ordinance and by permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9252)|
| 2:34:18| Also keep in mind the county's stormwater engineering consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9258)|
| 2:34:22| and Department of Engineering and Public Works staff recommended to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9262)|
| 2:34:27| that every pipe in the three critical situations for public safety is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9267)|
| 2:34:33| So not only is it possible that the taxpayers will bear the burden of pipe failure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9273)|
| 2:34:38| they'll bear the burden of tax dollars spent defending the county in lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9278)|
| 2:34:43| and if the injured parties are successful, paying for the claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| As a civil engineer responsible for the city's pavement management program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9288)|
| 2:34:53| I've always found it an embarrassment to excavate newly paved streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| like has happened on Shaliford Road in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| Some folks say new asphalt cuts easy, and that's pretty embarrassing for a governmental agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9301)|
| 2:35:07| when that has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9307)|
| 2:35:10| Since 1989, I and my neighbors and guests have been driving over a bump on Shaliford Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| due to the patch in the road after the rusted out metal pipe was dug out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9316)|
| 2:35:22| from under the newly paved roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9322)|
| 2:35:26| These three critical situations are not going to create a monopoly for the concrete pipe companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9326)|
| 2:35:32| Some examples of where other pipe materials can be used are on side drains on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9332)|
| 2:35:38| drainage systems around houses, in yards, or between the yards of houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9338)|
| 2:35:45| or the on-site storm drainage systems in commercial developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9345)|
| 2:35:50| The property owner there can use whatever material they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| I appreciate the commission, and I applaud you all for your public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| You perform a tough job, and sometimes you don't get a lot of thanks for the job that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9360)|
| 2:36:07| But I also want to remind you that as public servants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| your first duty is to protect the public's safety, health, and welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9370)|
| 2:36:16| As a taxpayer, I've been in contact with all of you by two letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9376)|
| 2:36:20| one dated June 12th and the most recent September 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9380)|
| 2:36:24| I've made available to each of you photos of the washed out rusted pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9384)|
| 2:36:31| on the road in which I live in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| A photo from the 1989 Knoxville Journal and a 2007 pipe photo showing rust in the bottom of the metal pipe replaced in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9394)|
| 2:36:45| If others in the audience today want a copy, just contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| That's two rusted out metal pipe failures on Chaliford Road in my own neighborhood since 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9409)|
| 2:36:56| I don't remember ever seeing a concrete pipe fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| I'm sure a concrete pipe has failed somewhere, sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| I just can't identify, never seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| I invited each of you to view the metal pipe location on my street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9428)|
| 2:37:13| that has failed two times in 45 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9433)|
| 2:37:16| and is currently rusting out on the bottom after being installed three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| You just have to see it to believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| If Commission's intent is to subsidize first-time home buyers or to subsidize development costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9447)|
| 2:37:34| then there are more effective ways to do that without weakening the stormwater ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9454)|
| 2:37:40| and allowing all pipe materials in critical situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| I've been a Knox County resident, a Knoxville civil servant, and an engineer for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9465)|
| 2:37:51| So I know a lot of folks who work in local government and I know a lot of folks in the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9471)|
| 2:37:57| For my view, on August 27th, the Commission took a proposed strong stormwater ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070924?start=9477)|
