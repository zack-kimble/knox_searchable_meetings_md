| 0:10:20| I'm going to cover my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Yeah, I guess on to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| In the manner of the way we're going to conduct business today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| what I want to do is go through each of the three plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| plus the two revisions that we have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| And if the committee will allow me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| what I'd like to do is just I'll go through all those myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| and just briefly give the pros and cons of each of those as I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| as I know them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| And certainly you all chime in to what you think there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| But kind of go over that pretty quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| the plans that we have out there for consideration right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| Then we'll have public comment after that so we can get some comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| And then we'll have further discussion after we hear the public comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| I mean, we've talked about this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| You know, we've all said this is a plan we have to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| There will be another plan in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| so this is a somewhat temporary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| But it's an important plan because there's an election coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| and folks are certainly needing to know where their districts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| So with that, I guess we'll start with the computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| The NPC guys have us ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| So we'll start with plan six, redistricting plan number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| This plan came back to light at our last meeting because of the school board plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| We drew this plan based on trying to not split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| So what we did was we put Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| Doherty's torpor equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| In order to not split precincts, if most of the precincts was in one district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| we threw it all in that district, and that's how this plan was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| It basically mirrors the school board plan, which was a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| When I first saw this plan, I thought it looked good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| It keeps Farragut together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| It keeps North Cedar Bluff and Cedar Bluff East together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| It's got a lot going for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| The problem is it moves 86,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| which was 37,000 people more than any other plan we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| Plus it changed PAL significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| It changed halls somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| It did some things to the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| And so there are some issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| It moved out something like five or six incumbents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| That's the reason we didn't really give it a lot of consideration the first go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| Just the real statistics on it was it moved 84,746 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| and the relative deviation was 9.39%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| We had to be under 10%, so it was getting pretty close to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| We can move on to the next plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| Plan 7A here is the plan that the town of Farragut submitted to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| It's a very good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| I was pleased when I saw their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| It moved very few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| It moves 51,970 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| It had the lowest relative deviation of any plan I've seen, 4.91%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| That is almost a fairness quotient as to the division between the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=801)|
| 0:13:30| The things that it did that we've heard here at the podium that folks did not like was it split North Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| and East Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| It put Powell and Danny in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| It did some things to the Carter community that we've heard issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| High School and Petticoat went to the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| So some folks had some issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| So after our meeting last time, I went back with the GIS Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| and tried to improve on that plan based on what we heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| So we came up with Plan 7B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| And I know a lot of folks have not seen this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| It's been on the Internet for a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| And it's in the back of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| And what we were able to do with 7B, we were able to keep North Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| and East Cedar Bluff together by basically switching out Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=860)|
| 0:14:30| And we actually were able to reduce the total number of folks moved to 46,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| which was almost the very lowest number we had, 46,785.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| And the relative deviation, that was still 9.85% in 7B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| But that was not bad, but it still had that Halls and Powell issue, the Carter issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| and it put Cedar Bluff North and East in the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| where some of the comments I've heard that folks may or may not have liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| Let's move on to Plan 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| Plan 3 was one that we brought out because of the way it treated some of the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| It was a plan I developed early on as an extreme of one of our criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| which was to try to have the lowest number of people and the lowest standard deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| Not really thinking about very much else with it, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| And so, as you can see, one thing, it took four or five incumbents out of their districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| It did some things to the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| It did some things to the 2nd District that a lot of folks did not like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| So it had some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| So I went back and tried to revise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Now we're on to the last plan, 3A, for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| And really, 3A, what happened here, 3A is really taking the best, I think, of all the other plans, if you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=952)|
| 0:16:01| It takes North Cedar Bluff and East Cedar Bluff, puts them in the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| I know they would like to be in the 5th, but I have heard that they wouldn't mind being in the 3rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| as long as they're together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| It does that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| It keeps the Carter community basically together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| I've heard, I think Commissioner Wright had said, the 8th District, we don't feel we should lose anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| We might gain a precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| It gains the precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| It's the Gap Creek Precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| The 9th District gains Precinct 10-S, which is UT's campus and student housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=987)|
| 0:16:34| which I think has some logic in that UT has already moved south of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| There's a lot of student housing over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| The 1st District has a lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Frankly, this plan moves the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Districts significantly, the city districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| The good thing about the 1st District, it looks a lot like the city council map of its councilmanic district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| and it increases the minority population to 50%, which we've never been able to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| The 2nd District loses one precinct and gains one precinct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| although the precinct they lose is Beaumont going to the 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| and the precinct they gain is Norwood, and it does split the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| This is the worst problem I have with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| I could not find any way to solve that dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| Norwood and Commissioner Harmon, that's part of his district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| and I've asked him to talk to some of his folks in the Norwood community about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| and I'm sure he'll tell us in a minute what reaction he got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Because the 3rd District really changes significantly in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| they become a split district basically between city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| They've been primarily a city district for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| and now they're gaining North Cedar Bluff, a county district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| But almost all the districts have some city in them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| Another change there is that West Hills goes to the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| and West Hills sort of puts West Hills back together again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| They were split years ago, and it kind of puts West Hills back as they once were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| It also adds Pond Gap Elementary to the 4th District as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| The 7th District, and I want to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| Ms. Carringer had nothing to do with this, but it did not change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| and it was not by design, it's just the way it worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| We were working around the map, and the 7, it turned out, did not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| No one tried to force it to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| In case anyone wants to make that suggestion, it was not made that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| And you know previous that somebody asked me that I'd probably like Plan 3 early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| and I said no because that didn't change in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| So 3A, I just want to make that clear, that that had nothing to do with Commissioner Smith or Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| We were just trying to do the most logical, orderly thing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| and that's just the way it worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| So with that, do any of the committee members have any comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| before we have public comments on any of these plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| Anybody want to add anything to the pros or cons I just put out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| This is basically my view of it, I guess, and I have tried to draft all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| Well, first of all, I want to apologize to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| The last time I said I don't think any of us knew what we were doing, but you obviously do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| Of all the concerns I've had, this 3A, what you all have done there, addresses all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| So I said last time I couldn't vote for any of the plans, I can certainly vote for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Well, the only thing I'd have to say, we had a Norwood homeowners meeting last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| and I took this 3A plan and showed it to Lynn Redmond and several of the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| And, of course, nobody likes change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| But, you know, like the whole problem of this program, we have to make some changes or we wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| And I think this plan 3A makes the least amount of change in all the ones we've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| So, so far, I think Norwood's pretty well happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| Hearing no other comments, I guess we'll go to public comments if anyone wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| I have a sign-up sheet back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| I'm not sure if anyone has signed up, but let me get that and just look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Ms. Maurer, I believe, wants to speak, so I'll let her start out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Ms. Maurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| Please give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| I'm Sue Maurer, 8824 Farmington Drive, Cristwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| I'm president of the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| And we've discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| As much as we hate to leave the 5th District, which I'm sure you all understand we've been apart for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| however, this plan 3A does keep our subdivision together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| where before we were going to be divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| And we certainly want to remain united.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| So, as far as having no choice, 3A is a better choice for our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| But I would like to put it on record that when they do the redistricting in two years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| that they certainly consider putting us back in the 5th District, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| Because I know Dr. Briggs is losing over 20,000 votes by moving us out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| And we have certainly supported him, and he's been very supportive to that 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| We're going to miss him, but hopefully, you know, things will work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| And we certainly do appreciate keeping our subdivision together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| Does anyone else wish to comment on any of these plans at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1298)|
| 0:21:47| Well, hearing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| I guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| I'd like to make a motion we accept 3A and send it on to the full County Commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| You ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| Well, that was pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| So, I know I'm not a member of this, but may I speak for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Sure, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| So, your plan is just to send one of these to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| That's exactly what we discussed early on, yes, to send a single plan to County Commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| Well, I'm disappointed that there was not more support for one of the seven plans, 7A or 7B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| To me, they are a more logical representation of what the 2nd District should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| There is a natural affinity for people who shopped the Felini Kroger and lived between the interstates and have the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1360)|
| 0:22:50| We already have part of Fountain City in our district, and Fountain City Town Hall regularly welcomes us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| The addition of Gresham would have made a lot more sense than the addition of Norwood, which splits Norwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| which is the major flaw of the plan that you fellows just, you folks just unanimously recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| So, I see that as a major flaw in your argument, and I wish you had thought about it more seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Yes, I gave it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| We went from 13 plans down to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| I saw that, but you still have left a major flaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Well, all the commissions will have the opportunity to put what they want to do into the plan when we have the workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| But now, like I said, it's not over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| I went to the Norwood Homework Meeting last night, and there was probably 30 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| And nobody wanted to change, but they realized we've got to make change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| And we split us, but, I mean, that's part of the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Yes, I just wanted to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| And sort of just to let Mark know, just speaking, I guess you'd say in support of him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| we do have the opportunity when it goes to the full commission if anything can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| We're happy, I believe, with the 3A plan, you know, as far as Crestwood is concerned, which has been a major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| Since this is an open meeting and we may not have an opportunity to discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| and Chairman Strickland is here today, do we need to have a go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| and think about setting a time for a workshop where we can do this rather than just at a commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| Oh, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| And, you know, really, and I'm just making a comment here more than anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| if we got this done before the commission meeting at the end of the month, we could get this thing voted on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| I guess we could even vote on it at a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Yeah, we could vote on it at a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| As long as we have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| My idea was to probably have a workshop in August, 1st of August, and have a workshop meeting and get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| That's just what I wanted to bring up since we're all here and can talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| and we can't otherwise is that might be better to have a workshop rather than try and do this at a commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| and then get off on a tangent that takes three or four hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| I definitely want a separate meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| I just want to make another comment to Rick Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| I think you all in the committee, I think you all have really done a good job on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| This was a job that I don't think anyone envied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| And as I was telling some of the people from Crestwood, there is absolutely no one that's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| No one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| But I think really of the circumstances, this is really, you all put a lot of work in on it and a lot of people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| But this is really a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| And I wanted to say thanks to all the folks who have helped with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| Dr. Luthold put a lot of thought into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| He's not here today, but he put a lot of thought and time into his plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| and I thought he had a really, really good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| His report was very helpful to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| And I think some of the plans we have reflect some of his thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| Commissioner Burrell submitted some very good plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I appreciate her thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Plan 7A, her plan, independently looked very similar to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| She did a, I wish I'd had more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| I was on vacation last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| We were all out and I think she was out some today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| And I just haven't had a chance to catch up with her, unfortunately, to talk to her more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| But she did voice the issue of Norwood and that did concern me greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| And I've worked and worked trying to get 3A to fix that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| but there's just not a way to do that with the rest of the plan, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1589)|
| 0:26:38| And I also want to give a lot of thanks, though, to the Planning Commission fellows that have helped us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| They've done the majority of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Frankly, I've given them guidance, but they've done the heavy lifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| I've given them some things, but they've produced some of the maps and all this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| done the math for us, wrote the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Dr. Terry Gahula, Tim Kuhn, and Alex Zindel have done a great, great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| And for the commissioners here, the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| I want you to know they do more than just sector plans and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| They've got staff members like these guys that can solve all kinds of problems for the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| If we give them an opportunity to do it, I mean, they're really, really excellent at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| So I want to give them a lot of support here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| And when their budget requests come up in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| I hope they get a lot of consideration because they deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Anybody have anything else they want to comment on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| With that, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1652)|
| 0:28:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090708special?start=1682)|
