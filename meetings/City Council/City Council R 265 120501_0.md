| 0:02:09| I've got a couple of things to report to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| First, I want to thank everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| We had 700 or 800 people come out for the budget luncheon on Friday, and I want to thank everybody who did come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=136)|
| 0:02:23| And now City Council has the budget, and they'll start their hearings soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| When will that be, May 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| May 22nd, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| And 23rd, Council will be looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| And those should be on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Where's Mr. York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| All the budget documents should be on our city website, cityofknoxville.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| So I invite everyone to take a look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| I do want to report that yesterday we kicked off a new initiative from our Parks and Recreation Department called Let's Move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| and it is a campaign to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| and it is part of a national campaign that is led by First Lady Michelle Obama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| Locally, we have quite a few partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| I just want to recognize a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| Our county school system through the Coordinated School Health Specialists, Anissa McDonald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| the Knoxville Track Club, Christy Altman has been involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| the Knox Area Coalition on Childhood Obesity, and our Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| And this group has brought, is going to actually have a kickoff event this Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=210)|
| 0:03:40| at both Victor Ash Park and at the Holston-Chelhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| And this is some activities for children, things like soccer, karate, obstacle courses, track and field, jump rope, shuttle runs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=225)|
| 0:03:57| worm bins, make your own trail mix, seed planting, and many more activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| And at, let's see, at 12 noon, at 2 p.m., they will be doing a Let's Move flash mob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| and the kids have been and teachers at the schools have been preparing the kids to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| I know you'll all want to be there, and perhaps council should participate in the Let's Move flash mob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=255)|
| 0:04:24| Also, just want to acknowledge quickly a few of the sponsors for that, Walgreens, Moonwalks and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| Home Depot, B97.5, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and Subway are all involved, so we certainly appreciate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| and hope a lot of families will come out for that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| Also, I wanted to ask Kay Graybeal, who is the Historic Preservation Planner for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=280)|
| 0:04:49| She is going to give us a very brief overview of the annual preservation report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| and this is something that our city charter requires us to receive annually in MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| and our Historic Preservation Planner prepares that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| So, Kay, if you'd like to introduce yourself and give us your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| Good evening, Madam Mayor and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| As the mayor mentioned, I'm Kay Graybeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| I'm the Historic Preservation Planner for the Knox-Knoxville MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| Thank you for this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| I'm pleased to submit this report as a summary of preservation activities for the year 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| I'd like to take a brief moment just to hit some of the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| The Historic Zoning Commissioners listed on the slide before you are those that served during the calendar year 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| and as you can see, this very busy commission included now-council member Finbar Sanders as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| As of January 2012, Mr. Scott Busby is serving as chair and Ms. Sandra Martin as vice chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| and we also have a new member, Mr. Jason Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| Improvement projects reviewed by the commission's staff members last year totaled 115,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| which is slightly up from 104 during the calendar year 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| So it's good news that renovation activities has held its own over the last few tough economic years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| The report also highlights the National Register nominations of buildings by the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| as well as renovation activities throughout the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| This activity, coupled with that of potential for school building renovations such as that of Oakwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| makes it very apparent that adaptive reuse of historic buildings is synonymous with economic development in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| The presentation of this report is well-timed since May is National Historic Preservation Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| This year's nationwide theme is Discover America's Hidden Gems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| You can visit our website at knoxnpc.org under the Historic Preservation tab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| to see a list of treasured historic districts and properties to explore and celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| I'd like to introduce Kim Trent, executive director of Knox Heritage, if she is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| just to take a brief moment to highlight events that they are sponsoring to celebrate National Historic Preservation Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| And if she hasn't been able to make it, I do have a slide for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| I just got here 30 seconds ago, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| That was down to the wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| We had our executive committee meeting at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| So I want to thank all of you for all the support you've given to preservation in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| and let you know about some exciting events we have this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| that are open to Knoxvillians and Knox Countians and actually all of East Tennessee where we work now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| On May the 15th, we will release our Fragile 15 list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| the most endangered properties in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| And that will be at Bennett Galleries at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| And I'm going to pass around postcards so you'll all have your list of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| We're also launching, and we're very thrilled about this, finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| a downtown walking tour for downtown Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| So come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| I should have done that years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| It's been years in the making, a lot of research and a lot of effort from many, many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| who have put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| We'll have free walking tours on May 19th at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| starting at the Visitor Center for anyone who wants to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| And the brochures are free and will be available in locations all over downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| So we hope that you will come and join us that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| And then we're having a special Lost and Found Luncheon on May the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| which will be at the Square Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| And it is the cost of lunch to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| but we'll have a panel discussion on the Civil War sites that are still existing in Knoxville today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| and that we are striving to preserve today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| So thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I'll start these on either side and pass them around, and we hope to see you at our events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| It's a great month, and Knoxville is a national leader in preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| and recognized as such all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| Kim, before you leave, or if you're still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| is that walking tour also going to be on the website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| Since someone may not be able to go downtown and get the brochure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| but they can sure plug into their magic assistant they have these days and follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| You can go to knoxheritage.org slash tours, and we have tours for downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| and we'll be adding audio and video features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| Jack Neely has provided podcasts for 12 of the locations downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| with the financial support of Scripps Networks, which we're grateful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| And so you can see online, but we also have other neighborhoods from Island Home to Sequoia Hills to Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=573)|
| 0:09:41| There are neighborhood tours available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| So you can see photographs, read history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| A little map, too, so you can do your own walking tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| We have Google Maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| And we'll soon roll out PDFs similar to this for all of those neighborhood tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| Can I download an app, walking tours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| We don't have an app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Those cost a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| But we do have a website, and so you can go and look at those on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Thank you, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| And one of the reasons why we are known nationally for our historic preservation efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| is because of you, Kim, and your board and your volunteers and members of Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| So we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=618)|
| 0:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| And so, Kay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| And you all know, of course, we knew Ann Bennett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| who was in the preservation planner role for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| and it's nice to have Kay here since Ann decided to retire on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| Thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| So now reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Yes, thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| I just wanted to announce that we will be holding a workshop this Thursday in this assembly room at 530 to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| further discuss the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| I also wanted to announce a festival will be happening May the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| That's a week from Saturday, 11 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Hopefully, many of you have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| But if you've not, it's really, really a great event in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| We're open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Please come shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Just wanted to throw that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| From 11 to 7, there will be vendors of all different types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| There will be music, food vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| It's a family-friendly event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| The Candora, historic Candora building will be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| And there will be an art exhibit during that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| So I've ordered good weather for that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| Hopefully, it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| But just please come and check out the festival if you haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| If you've been there, I know you're coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| So it's a really, really great event, and we certainly hope to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Vice Mayor, I mean, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| I want to thank you and your staff for the ribbon-cutting ceremony that was held on yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=718)|
| 0:12:05| and somewhat in conjunction with historic preservation at the Oddfellows Cemetery on Bethel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| And that is an historic African-American cemetery, and the city has cleared that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=733)|
| 0:12:21| It's looking very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| And also with a new street paving there on Kyle Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| and a curb to prevent flooding that was taking place in that cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| And also I want to announce on Thursday at 5 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| KCDC will be having a community forum at Walter P. Teller in the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| So that entire area with hopefully some more improvements at Walter Hardy Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| and the Oddfellows Cemetery and the Eastport Residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| we're looking for great things in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| I just wanted to remind you that May is also Bike Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| and we're having a ride Monday night at 6 o'clock, and we're leaving the Winsong Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| It's a ride with elected officials, and everybody's invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| And we're going to ride from Winsong Park up to West Hills and then turn around and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| Sponsors for this event are Bike Walk Tennessee, Smoky Mountain Wheelman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| Southern Cycling Operations, Mass General Store, Knox County Safe Routes to Schools Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| and Knox County and Knoxville Parks and Greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| So everybody's welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| I hope you'll come out and enjoy your evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Six o'clock, Monday, at Winsong Theaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Oh, thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| I just wanted to thank David Brace and the guys at the public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| There's a crew out there that has been helping us with the Tank Strickland Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| There's a section that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| The city has partnered with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| It's technically a county park because the library is on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| but eventually the three nasty old buildings have been torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| A section of the park was done about a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| and right now the neighborhood is working with the public service guys to get some dirt spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| We're seeding it and strawing it, and it's going to be green for the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| And we're really thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| You know, those guys come out there, and they may punch a clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| or get paid somewhat by the hour, but they really take ownership of a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| And when they get out there, they make it their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| They go out of their way to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| And I was really impressed with their service and their commitment to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| and I just wanted to thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| I think that shows what great employees we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| First of all, Mary, I'd like to thank you for coming back to the third district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| to announce your budget on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| We were thrilled to have you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| And also to the crew who made the park look beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| It really does look like that most of the time, but it looked exceptionally good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| And to Vice Mayor Pavlis, who listened to me and worked on that sunny day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| I also have another announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| On Thursday, May the 10th, the Westview community will be meeting to review plans to create the Westview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=927)|
| 0:15:35| Historical Cemetery District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| There are six cemeteries in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| One is maintained by the Lowness family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| The other five are not as well-maintained, I guess is the way to phrase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| And we have all, most of us have contributed some money to get a design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| The sheriff's crew has been working to clean out the hillsides and make it an attractive place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| And so on Thursday, May the 10th, 7 p.m., at the Westview Wesleyan Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| the plans will be presented for moving forward to take the next steps in making this a historic district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| I just wanted to get an update on the mulch situation and also on our shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| So I'm going to call on Chief Sharp first to talk about the mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| Yes, we ceased, we finished our emergency operations last Friday at the mulch site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| And then as soon as that was over, our fire marshal's office visited the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| and put some restrictions, requirements on the future of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| The most significant one is that the owner has to come up with a fire protection plan designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| and stamped by a fire protection engineer and then approved by the fire marshal's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| before he can, before the city will continue any operations with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| In the meantime, until he does come up with that, we've put several other restrictions in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| Probably the most significant one is that he must maintain a 24-hour fire watch, seven days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| 24 hours a day, and that includes very specific things that they have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| walk the site every 30 minutes and keep a log and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| Also have to improve fire department access on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| and greatly reduce the piles and increase the separation between those piles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| So those temporary measures are in place right now until the fire protection plan is submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1058)|
| 0:17:46| and approved by the fire marshal's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| Mayor, do we have any idea what it has cost the city so far as far as this whole event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| Christy, can you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Christy Branscom, our senior director of public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| The only thing I would add to what Chief Sharp's comments is that we're also going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| to be requiring a stormwater management plan that's also going to be attached to the fire protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| and hopefully be incorporated into contractual terms with Shamrock to help protect the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| Right now, I think there was about $30,000 in tipping fees that the city did incur for the work that was required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1095)|
| 0:18:25| in getting the brush off of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| But in terms of a full, the total cost, we don't know that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| No, we don't have a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| We're still working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Jim York has it within 10 cents, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| And any other questions on that, on the mulch, before we move on to the shingles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Does that mean you're no longer accepting brush there until he comes up with a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| He's no longer accepting brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| We're not taking brush there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| He's no longer accepting our brush there until the plan has been submitted to us and then approved by us, by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| Where is it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| It's being diverted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| You guys passed an emergency measure, right, for 30 days at the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1147)|
| 0:19:20| Actually, I think that just Boyce was able to sign that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Shingles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Ready for an update on the shingles saga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| When last we left this story, the Chancery Court had entered an order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| which prohibited any further shingles from being brought on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| It also required the persons who were operating those two sites to present to the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| they required them to submit to us a plan for getting rid of those shingles for abating the nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| and the zoning violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Rather than do that, they left town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| They were not from here and have returned from whence they came, I presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| But they are no longer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| As a result of that, the owners of the two locations have gone to court, each of them have gone to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| and obtained an order essentially evicting them from the site, even though they left before they were evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1216)|
| 0:20:25| That left us with the necessity of now dealing with the owners to deal with this both nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| and violation of our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| And they were very cooperative to come in and sit with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| About three weeks ago, they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| Both sets of owners came in, and we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| And I asked them to put together a written plan for us as to how they were going to get rid of the shingles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| and abate that nuisance and get rid of the zoning violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| They have, in fact, complied with that request and have both furnished to us a plan for doing that very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1255)|
| 0:21:05| And the good news, the very good news with regard to each of the plans was that both planned to get rid of the shingles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| by recycling them rather than taking them and dumping them in a landfill somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| So we were pleased about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| We had encouraged them to give strong consideration to finding a solution to this problem that would allow them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| recycle these materials that are out there, and they were cooperative in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| More good news with regard to the west site, the western site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| At that site, the owner has sent to us a plan that essentially will have all the shingles gone from the property by the fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1298)|
| 0:21:49| of this year in a very prompt and reasonable fashion through a process where the shingles will be recycled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1309)|
| 0:22:00| On the other hand, we got a proposal from the owners of the eastern site that also involved recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1320)|
| 0:22:10| but was not nearly so timely nor prompt in the getting rid of the shingles and abating the nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| Their timeline was something more along the line of three, three-and-a-half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| And so today, after receiving their proposal, we have sent them a copy of the west plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1342)|
| 0:22:32| and we have asked them, we have suggested to them that it might be better if they dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| with that on a more prompt basis than the three years that they had proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| So there's ongoing activity in dealing with that east site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| We're not done with it yet, but neither are we ignoring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| We're planning to move forward to get rid of those shingles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| and make those areas come back into compliance with our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| 9A is an ordinance amending Chapter 15, Article 2, Subsections 15, 51, 57, 58, and 63 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1384)|
| 0:23:13| relating to the nondiscrimination policy for the hiring and employment practices of City of Knoxville employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| I see some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| I also have two speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Would you like to hear from the speakers first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| First speaker is Peter McKee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| Good evening, Mayor Ruggiero and City Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| My name is Pete McKee, and I am a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you, you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| I hope it won't take nearly that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| I'm a manager at Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| I work in the BB&T Tower and where our global primary products business unit is headquartered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| It's a $10 billion a year business, and it's one of the major business units within Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| Alcoa has been committed to equality in the workplace for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| But it's been the last three to five years under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer, Klaus Kleinfeld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| where we have really stepped up to the mark and made equality in the workplace a very focal point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| of the way we do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Alcoa has affinity groups that support women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and LGBTQ employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1469)|
| 0:24:39| From Alcoa's perspective, the labor market is very competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| And in today's economy, we, as a business, cannot afford to eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| or discourage any talented individuals for working for our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| So it is a very clear business case, but there is also a very clear human case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| It's 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| The time to stop bigotry and hatred and prejudice is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| I am proud to see that my company has taken the position it has with regard to equality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| and inclusion in the workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| And I am also glad to see the city of Knoxville take steps in that direction also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| Ben Byers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| And then just restate your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| And you'll also have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| My name is Ben Byers, 915 Claybrook Court, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| I am here representing all of these people and also the Tennessee Equality Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| And I'd like to very first off thank counsel for the vote two weeks ago in the first reading of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| and Mayor Rojero for her support in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| This ordinance is a big step forward for a community that has, especially in recent times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| and historically struggled to find acceptance in a lot of areas, employment being a big one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1558)|
| 0:26:06| It's also a huge step forward, I think, for the city to say a lot of what our friend from Alcoa said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| that it is a competitive job market and the city needs to have the best people for the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| and those are the most qualified people and the people who care the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| and do the best job regardless of what their various minority statuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| or majority statuses may be across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| And we'd just really like to thank you for your support in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| and we hope it's the first step in a great partnership of making equality front and center as part of what Knoxville can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| And I've been asked really briefly if the people who are here supporting could quietly stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| We've got a lot of people who came out tonight to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| and they really wanted to let you guys know how much they appreciate the opportunity to put this issue in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you, Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| I just simply wanted to thank you for bringing this item forward and getting it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| I know you have spoken to every single council representative, at least I think you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| and I thank you for your support and your pro-action in bringing this to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| So I fully intend to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Oh, Councilman Starr, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| I just wanted to reiterate what the guest speaker said and Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you for bringing this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| I think it's a very good policy for three reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| One, it's a good policy for our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| Two, I hope that private firms in the area will follow suit and adopt it in their own discrimination policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1669)|
| 0:27:57| And three, I think it's hopefully it will be a sign to people in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| and in the region that Knoxville is a place that embraces and celebrates diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| So I just want to thank you for your leadership in bringing this to us in such a prompt manner in your term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1707)|
| 0:28:42| I would just like to personally thank council for your support on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1727)|
| 0:29:02| 11A is a resolution to adopt a plan for the Knoxville City Council Internet Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| I just wanted to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| I know the county commission has this forum set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| and I thought that it would be a good idea to mirror that practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| I think we obviously should always be open and let folks see our thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| And sometimes we have thoughts after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| So this would be a great way to be able to exchange information or make comments or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1773)|
| 0:29:43| under the Sunshine Law with everyone watching us, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| But, you know, it may be used, may not be used, but I think it's a good policy to have it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| It will probably be at the end of June before it's up and functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| And, of course, we'll have, you know, announcements leading up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| The IT department is tied up in a major project, I think, with KPD right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| So we'll take a back seat to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| and hopefully have some more information as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| I just want to thank Vice Mayor Pavlis for getting this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| You know, this is a job that you can't be in all the places you need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| And we all find out that if something's happening in their district as opposed to another district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| the person who's on the scene has a lot of times more factual information that needs to be shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| so people can do their own due diligence and investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| And this is going to be, I think, a good tool to help all the council people be focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| and ready to discuss the issues when they get to the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| And you can't do it all the time on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| You need time to look at it, to think about it, to chew on it, to further investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| This is a healthy step to keeping us all informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| So I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Now, City Council Attorney Rob Frost tells me that I need to ask if there's anybody in the audience who wants to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1868)|
| 0:31:16| that may not have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| Is there anybody that would like to address this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Seeing none, I believe I still need a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| Does somebody want to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| This is to the issue of an Internet forum for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1897)|
| 0:31:46| Yes, my name is Beth Maples-Fay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| And I have low vision, and I'm unable to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| And meeting with my council members is very difficult as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| And this would give me a way to communicate with you without having to be mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| Thank you, Ms. Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Actually, my understanding is that this will be just a way you can see how council members may communicate with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1929)|
| 0:32:18| You know, by sunshine law, they can't talk to one another unless it's in a public setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| So you would not be able to actually e-mail them on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| But you can see the conversation that's going on among council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| But you can still they're all available by e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| And so I would hope that there will be a link on the site that would also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| if you want to directly communicate with one of the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you for bringing that up because we want to make sure that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| I need a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to delegate authority to act a certifying officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| for environmental reviews of exempt and categorically excluded activities in connection with the receipt of federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| 11C is a resolution to adopt the Knox County City of Knoxville and Town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| multi-jurisdictional local hazard mitigation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Go ahead, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| I would like to just make one comment, and I've already talked to the Department of Engineering about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| In reading the plan, which was complete and exhaustive and exhausting reading it, there was --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2019)|
| 0:33:47| We'll take that as a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| 240 pages of joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| It was thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| The schools were not present, and I'm told they were asked to be present and chose not to be for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| But it seems to me in any plan, especially of this nature, they just simply must have a part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| They're way too big a piece of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| But that's just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| I'm Jim Hagerman, director of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| The emphasis in this iteration of this plan was more on the technical side, the definition of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| and documentation of current programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| As you said, schools were invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| They didn't see a role for themselves, so they didn't get involved much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| And as Councilwoman Palmer also mentioned, that the public participation side could have been stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2080)|
| 0:34:55| But, again, it was the emphasis was on the technical side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Perhaps the next iteration, five years out, there will be more of a function for public input per school participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2098)|
| 0:35:07| And bear in mind this is hazard mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| This is not emergency response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| This is about how you stop flooding from happening, right, that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| Flooding, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Flooding was identified as the hazard that was most readily addressed, that had the most need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2117)|
| 0:35:29| But it was, I mean, the projects involved here, the processes involved here were pretty technical as far as the solutions that were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2129)|
| 0:35:39| that are being explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| And there was, of course, a lot of participation from Knox County, City of Knoxville, and Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2141)|
| 0:35:49| and the various agencies inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| And they all have a lot of interactions with both the public and the schools as appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| So they were, in a way, indirectly involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| And as we get into this process, this being the first iteration, it's quite likely that there will be more involvement in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2162)|
| 0:36:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Yeah, I was going to thank the guys for their thoroughness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| but maybe suggest that in addition to the one that you're going to submit to FEMA that's over 200 pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| maybe you could have, like, a 25-page executive version that people can pick up and read the highlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| because it is somewhat exhausting to curl up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| 11-D is a resolution expressing appreciation to the Knoxville Firefighters Association for the donation of $13,237.54| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2202)|
| 0:36:51| to be used for the purchase of supplies for the Knoxville Fire Department's Learn Not to Burn Program in order to educate children about fire safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2221)|

| 0:37:07| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| I would like just to recognize that we have Kevin Faddis here, who's the president of the Firefighters Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| and we appreciate the money that you all raise and donate for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2234)|

| 0:40:50| and to have controls for lighting and heating and other things in central locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120501?start=2450)|
