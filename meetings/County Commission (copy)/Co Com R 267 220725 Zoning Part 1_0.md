| 0:15:39| we're interested, because of our investment in this property, of obtaining more units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| than the Metropolitan Planning Commission has suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| And right now, we think our basic infrastructure improvements, including widening the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| running the sewer, the water, the drainage, is probably going to be about $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| And at four units per acre, that makes our cost about $22,000 a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=967)|
| 0:16:16| And we're more inclined to suggest 12 units per acre to cut our cost down to about $6,200 per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=976)|

| 0:16:43| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| So, Mr. Charble, you are applying to this body for the 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Not the four that was recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| And we encourage the Commission, you know, that every time you pick up a development book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| or development article, it's all about how we're short on housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1016)|

| 0:17:11| But we know what the cost of development is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| We know how the cost of building is skyrocketed, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| And Mr. Cato just thinks that the people in Knox County deserve modern, convenient homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| And we think this is the right site to allow us to build on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| And in spite of, you know, what we want to do, you know, the population is continuing to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:39| And, of course, you know, just since I've been alive for the last 70 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1059)|

| 0:17:49| So, I mean, it's growing, and it's going to continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| And decent housing, modern housing is just something that is necessary for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| and we would ask the commission to increase the number to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| And we'll also point out that the corner of our property touches property on Sud Road that does have 12 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:13| and we're about a quarter of a mile from another tract where Bernard Road intersects with Sud Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1093)|

| 0:18:34| Mr. Snowden, what is the pavement width in front of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| It's very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| I haven't measured it specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| but I would estimate it to be a one-lane road in the neighborhood of anywhere between 12 and 15 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:57| Director Brooks, the applicant has stated that their property borders a density of 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:06| I was under the assumption from the maps I've seen there's a single residential piece of property separating these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| It does touch the property that has the 12 dwelling units per acre to the north there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| and then to the south are the single family homes, and then to either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| To the north on the back side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| On the back side, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| It looks like a portion of that parcel is zone PR, 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| Okay, and that's part of what I call the swath of medium density in that residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| Mr. Snowden, what kind of improvements need to be made to that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:54| What kind of improvements would we be asking the applicant to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| At a minimum, even at 12 dwelling units an acre due to the small acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| we couldn't ask for a traffic analysis based on the trip threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| However, at a minimum, I would like to see, we had recently partnered with the developer just to the north of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:19| I guess to the northeast of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| We would want to see at least a 20-foot wide road all entirely along their frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| and connecting to the improvement recently completed in partnership with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| that developer to where the folks that do live in there would have a safe and adequate roadway network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:41| out to the next collector roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Roughly how many feet of improvement would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1244)|

| 0:20:51| How many feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Commissioner, let me look real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1254)|
| 0:21:04| Probably in the neighborhood of 5 to 600 feet of roadway improvement that would bring it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| probably widen it in the neighborhood of 5 to 6 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:20| I do see, sir, where the very, I'll call it the very north corner touches 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:30| But we're leaving a single piece of property surrounded by 12 units an acre if we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| Bernard is a, it's a bad road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| It's one of the worst, actually, in northwest Knox County, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:52| You've got how many acres here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1314)|

| 0:21:58| And after we get up to 2 tenths of an acre for the road widening, we'll be down to about 2.2, we believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:10| Ms. Brooks, during the MPC meeting, how did the Metropolitan Planning Commission and commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| come to the figure of 4 units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| That was the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| That was the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| Let's see, let me make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Yes, staff recommendation was zoning up to 4 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:37| Mr. Snowden, in your opinion, at 4 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| is it feasible to make these improvements to the road without the help of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1363)|
| 0:22:53| From a financial perspective, I would imagine it would be difficult for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| I think, you know, the road is very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| There would be public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| So, I mean, I think the county could, we could look at the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| and see if it is in the condition of the pavements in, you know, poor shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| We could possibly partner with them to do an overlay of the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| if we were going to do so, you know, anyway, to try to assist in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| But, you know, I mean, I would estimate, you know, 500 feet new roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| I mean, they're probably, I mean, it's, I would think somewhere in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| of $40,000 to $50,000 would be a conservative estimate for them to widen the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| You know, I understand completely that we need housing, and we do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| But Barnard Road is a very rural setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Once you get past Sood Road, most of those tracks are decent sized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| And I've had a lot of people call me on Barnard Road that are worried that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| if medium density starts to creep up Barnard Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| it'll get to the point that people will try to go both directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| because you can't go out the other way to ball camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| And it's a dangerous task to try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| I'm inclined to try to give you a little bit more density to help offset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| but I can't go 12 on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| Four and a half would give you another unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| That's about all I think I'm able to go at this point on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| I look to my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker's light is on, and then Commissioner Biggs, and then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| Looking at the vote from the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| the individuals that have development background as part of their livelihood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1502)|
| 0:25:15| they turned this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| They went with the staff's recommendation of four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| So I'm totally against trying to go the 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| That just makes absolutely no sense on a little less than two and a half acres of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Thank you, Chairman Buehler. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| I agree with Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| There's no way I would touch anything close to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| I've known this area all of my life, traveled it multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| This is one of those roads where the school bus has the right of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| and you basically have to pull off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| I understand what Commissioner Smith is saying as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Wanting to try to do everything we can since we're in a housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| but at the same time there's a safety concern for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| especially knowing that there may be kids trying to ride the bus line and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Coming out on the woodsmith right there, that steep incline, given inclement weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| you're not going to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Sud Road, super steep, not going to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| So you'd have to go out ball camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| I'm more inclined to go with the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| just because I don't think that it's safe to go anything other than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| than to have to eat up the majority of your cost and widen the entire road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| and I don't think you'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| So from personal knowledge, I'll allow Commissioner Smith to make his recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| but I'll probably make a substitute motion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| Commissioner Jay, then Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Much of the same sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| I drove this, and I have a big truck, but it's not that big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| and I felt like I was in the same situation as when I several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| while I was on Carpenter Road, and, you know, the wheels are real close to the edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| and it is a, well, I wouldn't even call it a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| It's an old country road that got paved over and a little bit of extra shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| So I'm in the same boat of I can't see going beyond the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| I think if you can make something work in that realm, that's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| but if it's a safety issue and you can't even get two cars past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| when I drove it, I was worried that if I saw somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| I'd just have to back the whole way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| If we've got an idea that Barnard Road might be totally improved one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| I can see how medium density could certainly creep in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| but I'm having a hard time seeing it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| I actually know this road fairly well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| and I do not allow my vehicles to even drive on this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| because I just don't find it to being safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| If we keep it at a staff recommendation at four units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| we are not asking him to make road improvements at that point, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:11| That would be eight units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:20| Depending on where their entrance was, we might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| That is very, very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| I would like for them, if they were to move forward with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| to move the intersection as close to the improvements as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| We would potentially work with them to partner to get the road widened in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| because I know obviously for four units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| it's financially not feasible for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| I think we would be looking for some improvements even with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| just because of the narrowness of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| My personal opinion as a developer and contractor is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| if we're making them widen the road, I can see at most five units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| just because that would help offset the 50,000 plus it's going to cost them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| need to make profit to actually be able to afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| Otherwise, if we're not asking them to make the improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| I think four units or four and a half units is definitely reasonable for that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| My opinion is basically they're not building million-dollar mansions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| These are smaller units, so the profit margin on these units are 20 grand, 25 grand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| You eat up two of the eight units, you're already out profit from two of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| so you're only going to make profit on six units at most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Any other questions for Mr. Sharble or Ms. Brooks or Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| Mr. Sharble, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| My only comment is if not now, when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| My comment is if not now, when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| I heard the commission talk about safety, and that's no matter where you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| If you're on Interstate 40 or you're on a road like Bernard Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| and Bernard Road is not the only country road that exists in Knox County or East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| We know that, but you've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| My client is agreeable to submit to and pay for the widening of the road in front of his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1831)|
| 0:30:42| and we just think that this opportunity, they don't come along every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| He's not asked the county for any kind of concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| He's ready to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Once he gets his architectural plans approved by the county, he gets his building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| and the housing that he's trying to present to the community is quality, modern housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| Of course, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| A lot of the objections to this development that the Metropolitan Planning Commission received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1869)|
| 0:31:17| was based on safety and the width of the road and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| But like I said, if not now, when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Populations continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| There's a continuing demand for housing no matter where you go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| and the cost is only going to go up for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| So we would ask the commission to consider that in terms of giving us a maximum number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:44| that even the MPC or the commission thinks will work in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| But it's got to be more than four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Mr. Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| I'm sorry, your name passed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| What was it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| It's Nolan, Nolan Charble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Sir, just two years ago I voted against a development on Emory Road by Smith built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| that was seven acres, three units per acre for 21 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| and Emory Road is 11 foot each lane, and we were just worried about a blind curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| So I understand your argument, but at the exact same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| what would you do if we did approve 12 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| and we would ask you to put something on there to do all of Bernard Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| because that's basically what that development did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| They came in and they put in a turning lane and accommodated us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| because we did shoot them down the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| So if we were to shoot you down and we were to ask you to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| with a traffic study or improvement for all of Bernard Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| would that be feasible to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Because just reading the tea leaves in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| I think you're close to that four units per acre mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| what the staff recommendation was, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| Well, you know, I don't ask the, you know, when I go to see my doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| I don't say give me the same treatment you gave the last guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| And so I'm, and Smith built is a community organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| that does a great job at what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| and they kind of know the rules and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| So I'm not, you know, I'm not comparing this development to any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| And certainly we want it to be safe and we want it to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| And that's just what the cost of doing business today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| and, you know, in the home building business is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| whether it's apartments or condominiums or detached housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| So we're asking, you know, to consider, you know, this unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| and at least start this process of widening Bernard Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| if that's what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| You know, we're only probably about a quarter of a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| from the intersection of Pursuit Road and Bernard Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| and at least we're starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| And it's not going to make any difference to say we're going to do the whole road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| I'm sure my client would consider that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| but you've still got the issues of acquisition from other homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| if you're going to do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| I'm going to look for a motion to District 3 for further comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| The problem is even if you've got 12 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| and you were able to go from this property, that small section, to Sood Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| the rest of Bernard is still horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| And you can't guarantee us that the people that will live in these units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| will only go one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Bernard Road itself, I'm not sure it's even feasible to widen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| to ball camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| I am going to make a motion to approve at PR 4.5 units to an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| I have a motion by Commissioner Smith with a second by Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| to approve this rezoning at a density of 4.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| Commissioner Biggs, your line is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| I'd like to make a substitute motion to approve planning staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| I have a substitute motion by Commissioner Biggs to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| per the Planning Commission recommendation of 4 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| I have a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Is there any discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| All right, we will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Oh, Commissioner Ward, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| I would just like to make a point to Commissioner Biggs' point earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| that it would be one thing to widen the entire road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| I can see 12, like Commissioner Biggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| but I'm not going to argue with Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| or Commissioner Smith that the road is just way too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| So if you want to come back and offer to widen the entire thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| I think we'd be open to hearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| At least I would be, but at this point I can't see an argument against 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| or 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| I'm just afraid, Commissioner Biggs, that 4 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| that it doesn't give him any leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| I think that additional unit gives him some more ability to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| engineering to do some road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| Director Snowden, does he still have to make the road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| even if it's 4 or 4.5 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| Due to the narrowness of the road, most likely yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| I mean, at 4 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| and I think the gentleman said he had 2.4 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| that's 9.6 dwellings, so 9 dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| So usually a single family home generates 10 trips a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| so you're looking at 90 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| So, yeah, we would probably, you know, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| I want to see some participation, if not wholly on their part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| to improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| Mr. Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Mr. Snowden, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2232)|

| 0:37:20| so you're hoping that the traffic would flow what, to Sued Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| and from Sued Road go up and get Raj and go on over to Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| That section, and it may not really reflect it accurately on KGS now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| that curve has been recently improved both horizontally and vertically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2256)|

| 0:37:53| Everything west of that location is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| How wide is, say, Sued Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| Sued Road is a typical subdivision street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| It's probably, give or take, 25, 26 feet wide with curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2283)|

| 0:38:19| that's Kenosha County standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2299)|

| 0:38:23| and patch it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| It will have to be done completely, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| As this gentleman alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| he would have to submit design plans to our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| that had to be reviewed and approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| and we would actually bond those improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| and not release that surety until those improvements were completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2316)|

| 0:38:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=2324)|

| 0:50:13| And this first one is from the gentleman across the street whose property is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| Hello, my name is Dan Close, and I'm a resident of Pennell Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| I live across the street from the property for which Mr. Wayne Klein is requesting rezoning and sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| I understand Mr. Klein is appealing the commission's decision to deny his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| I would like to add my opposition to rezoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| It is my understanding that Mr. Klein would like to rezone the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| so that he may park and store commercial vehicles for his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| Pennell Lane is a small residential street and is already burdened by the medium-duty truck traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| of the commercial operation located halfway down its length, the landscaping that he referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| When these vehicles and their trailers are using the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| there is very little room for two vehicles to pass one another, and all pedestrian access is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:09| In addition, and I understand this is unique to myself and my adjacent neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| there is a depression in the street that causes significant noise when trailers are driven over it outside my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| This is quite annoying and I believe will only get worse and increase with medium and heavy-duty truck traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:28| I am also concerned that our street was not designed to handle the weight or frequency of these vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| which will result in premature damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| This is already evident from our current traffic burden where Pennell meets Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| and potholes have formed from these vehicles rapidly accelerating onto Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| I suspect this will worsen when Oak Ridge Highway is eventually widened to four lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| and making this turn becomes even more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| I believe Mr. Klein has stated that the noise and smells from the nearby recycling center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| have been detrimental to his ability to retain tenants for his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| I count myself among one of the very few people left in Knoxville that prefers to keep their windows open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| rather than using their air conditioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| I never claim to be the smartest, and I cannot recall ever hearing noise or smelling odors from the recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:21| Rather, I fear if Mr. Klein converts his property to a commercial parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| I will instead be subjected to the noise from the idling, daily preparation, and post-workday maintenance of his fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| I feel that this, along with the visual contrast and fumes they will generate in disparity to all the residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| surrounding them will be more detrimental to the neighborhood than any perceived annoyances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| from the recycling center on the adjacent street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| In summary, I wish to strongly oppose the rezoning of Mr. Klein's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| because I believe it will negatively impact our neighborhood, the physical integrity of our street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| and my property value and personal comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| While I will not be able to attend the hearing in person due to a scheduling conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| I am happy to discuss this with you in person via phone or email if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| He sent another letter that was dated July 17th. He sent another letter July 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:22| Dear commissioners, I'd like to thank those of you who followed up after my initial email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| Several of you inquired about my property 6904 being zoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| and if that was incongruent with my opposition to Mr. Ingram requesting that his property be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| Since my zoning is a core argument of Mr. Ingram's case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| I wanted to provide my full response to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| My property and my neighbor's property, 6902, are both zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| I was unaware of this when I initiated the purchase of my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| Originally, Dorothy Boshers owned both properties as a single parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| In the 1980s, her combined property was considered to be an Oak Ridge Highway address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| rather than a Pinnell Lane address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| She used this designation to obtain commercial zoning so she could perform sewing and alterations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:17| as a part-time business while her husband was working during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| She abandoned this business as they retired and eventually split the property into the two parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| to build a new house at what became 6902 and sell the older home, 6904, to her daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| It would then get sold again to her grandson and finally to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| No one after Mrs. Boshers has used either of the properties for commercial purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| nor do we have any intention to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| My belief is now that these properties are no longer directly accessible from Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| their commercial zoning is incongruent with a sector plan for our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| and they are only zoned this way because of their legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| Mr. Ingrams has suggested his property may become accessible from Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| following its eventual widening, but this is based on the very large assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| that not only will the county take the full property at 6905, which itself seems highly unlikely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| but also that the highway to come in over 220 feet beyond its current right-of-way to reach his property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:27| It's 220 feet from Oak Ridge Highway to the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| the beginning property line of the property they're talking about changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| I also believe Mr. Ingram is being disingenuous with his assertions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| that Pinnell Lane is now primarily rental homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| I am unaware of any rental homes other than his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| That he is finding it harder to lease his house as a residential dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| it has remained consistently occupied during his ownership and is currently occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| That the Karn Solid Waste Center behind his property generates noises and smells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| I have not experienced this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| I have not heard complaints from other neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| I am unaware of any filed complaints with the county to this effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| And in a recent conversation, his current tenant noted that the outdoor space of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| was the most desirable feature of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| and that he will continue to lease the property as a single-family residential unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| into the future as long as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| If it is his intention to not use the property for commercial purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| until after Oak Ridge Highway is widened and it becomes accessible directly from the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| there is no need to rezone at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| It would be more prudent to wait until highway construction is completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| or at least the plan is finalized to eliminate any variables or uncertainties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| about highway access or the presence of the neighboring property at 6905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3409)|

| 0:56:58| Since Mr. Ingram's arguments are based on assumptions of what will happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| with the Oak Ridge Highway expansion project, if and when it is finally approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| and since conversion of this property to an active commercial establishment before that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| has immediate potential to negatively impact the surrounding residential properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| I remain opposed to the zoning change and ask that you please uphold the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| I apologize for the long-winded email, but thank you again for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3442)|

| 0:57:57| He does bring up the landscaping company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| There is a landscaping company that uses Pinnell Lane as access to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| From what we understand, and we've only owned this property for 11 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| so we don't know prior to, but there was an issue with getting access to reach their landscaping company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3489)|

| 0:58:22| and there was some problems with the easements or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| so the gentleman has continued to use a driveway off Pinnell Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| and so two wrongs doesn't make a right, so because that has been allowed to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| we should not allow an additional commercial property on Pinnell Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| and you've all got the letters, but very, very strongly, and it is not a rental neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3521)|

| 0:59:14| Commissioner Jay and then Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| I'm confused about one of your statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| You said with the widening of Oak Ridge Highway, this would make it a corner lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| but 6905 is the commercial property that is the corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| Mr. Hartsfield's property is the corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| If they take all of this property, that would make this property a corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| So that's based on the assumption that Oak Ridge Highway would take his entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| Or Mr. Ingram can purchase whatever's left once the county takes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| or I'm sorry, TDOT takes from Mr. Hartsfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| Yeah, I'm not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Mr. Snowden, you might have to look at the map and tell me if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| but it seems like 6905 would be the corner lot regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| I don't know how wide that would be, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| Okay, second of that, maybe Mr. Snowden can look at it while I'm asking my second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| You mentioned 6927, which is just, that is the landscaping company, which I find really bizarre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:32| I'm trying to research how in the world they rezoned a real sliver corner of their lot to be commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| but the whole rest of it is residential and they're using a commercial company through a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| And I'm not exactly sure how that happened or I'm trying to research it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| but let's just assume that that stays and that's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| If your client's property is rezoned on one end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| and that landscaping companies were to remain commercially viable entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| and stay commercial on the other end, and that booked end the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| does that mean that 6921 and 6923 in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| would logically become commercial as well for the next two people that wanted to rezone theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| I can't answer that question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| But do you understand where I'm going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| If there's a precedence of the first one is being commercial and the two across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| and then your client would do theirs and that one's down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| then the next two people are going to go, well, hey, it's all commercial, keep on going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| Well, I think what you're asking me is where you draw the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| My answer is Mr. Ingram's property is surrounded on three sides already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| and that doesn't even include this commercial property at 6927| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| that's being used to access that landscaping company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| So Mr. Ingram wants to bring his property into this commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| He's looking ahead, and in response to our opposition, Ms. Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| Mr. Ingram doesn't want to take the people out of his house that are living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| He wants those lessees to stay there as long as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| I've heard Commissioner Bussler ask people tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| what are you going to do with your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Well, Mr. Ingram is going to keep the people in his property and not put his office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| At some point, he's looking ahead to the future, and that's why he's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| The hardest part for us as commissioners, and correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| is the best intentions sometimes are we have to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| based on what the land use is on this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| because your client a year from now could decide he wants to move to California and sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| and it's a commercial piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| and therefore we have to consider all the uses that are going to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| We could not put conditional zoning on this that would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| okay, if you wanted to have it as your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| Because one of the things that struggled me when I drove over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| literally right next door is Bill Timm's financial planning, and then the old gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| But then another house to the right is the insurance agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| Now those frontage onto Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| but there is a precedence for using houses as commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| but we can't put that condition that he put a fence up, put a buffer in a tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| and use it only for his office without storage of heavy equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| I think if you zone it CA, it's anything that can go in a CA zone or a CB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:51| whatever is being asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| And thank you, Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Ms. Brooks, what are the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| May I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| So is the same with Mr. Close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| So is the same at 6904 and 6902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| They've been zoned commercial for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| So they could then turn around and put a commercial establishment on Penn and Lane tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| Because they're already zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| I'm not sure this board would zone those commercial right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| They are commercial already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| No, I know, but we didn't make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| That wasn't a decision that was long before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| I'm not sure if that application came today for 6902 and 6904 to become commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| that we wouldn't have the exact same discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| So I'm not exactly sure when that happened or how that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| Do we know how 6902 or 6904, Ms. Brooks, became commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| I could look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| But I will tell you that the sector plan does not recognize those as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| That's one of the things that informed the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| So this is one of those conflicting things again where the sector plan says one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| but the reality is a different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| Which we found thousands of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| Can you remind me all the uses for CA or the major uses for CA that are allowable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:16| Give me a moment and I will get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| It's one of the broader ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| The use is permitted in the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| Houses, duplexes, aircraft landing fields, armories, signs, canneries, churches, schools, libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| dry cleaning shops, farming, garage apartments, hotels, motels, lodging, boarding houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| mobile homes, motor vehicles, bicycle and repair shops, skating rinks, dance halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| and establishments selling beer for consumption on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| Offices, banks, theaters, indoor, outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| There's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Yeah, there's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| This is one I've got to tell you guys I'm struggling with a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| I drove out there, but regardless of the fact, and to the residents of Pinella Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| I am actively trying to figure out how a commercial landscaping company got shoehorned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| into the back of a neighborhood and making sure that if it is legal, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| If it's not, then we've got some work to do because I just can't imagine how that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| But I struggle with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=3985)|

| 1:06:48| I don't have a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| I'm just bringing up ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4017)|
| 1:07:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| I can hear myself now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| Mr. Kline, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| You were denied on a sector plan change, and to have a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| one of the conditions had to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Which condition has been met to do a sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| Yes, there are several conditions that have to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| As I said in my remarks earlier, the expansion of the GC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| General Commercial Land Use Classification and commercial zoning in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| the right-of-way acquisition, which will take place, Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| in the next year, according to DOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| and the end result of the acquisition of that right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| plus all of the other commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| brings us into the expansion of the land use for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| as well as the change in the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| So those things make it right for a change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:16| I'm not sure I agree with you there, but the houses across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| and I looked it up, the sector plan and the general plan calls it to be LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| The future plans is LDR. It's not GC or GA or anything like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| It is LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| So that's a huge jump going from residential all the way to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| where is he going to be parking a truck with a Bobcat and all that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| Is that what it is? Did I hear that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| That's the only way he can put his office there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| is to have a place in that yard for his truck and trailer and Bobcat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| What is the reason for the denial of the sector plan as you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| As staff recommend the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| Because it's not compatible with the adjacent residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| Nothing has changed there yet, has it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| The roads have not been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Is there any improvements at all there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Sure, water, changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| How long has the house business been there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Probably a pretty good while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| It faces Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| Mr. Kline, I'm just kind of wondering where you're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| The first thing is general commercial changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| Director Brooks, when was the sector plan updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Younger than the south sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| There ain't no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| I'm with Mr. Jabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| I'm kind of having a hard time on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| Even though those houses are over there as commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| Director Brooks says they're not recognized as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| I have a hard time thinking that this would be a good commercial spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| It may change my mind later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| But really, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| I really don't think you've met a reason for the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| I would direct you to the letter I sent you, which has all the reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| as well as this is Mr. Ingham's lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| These red lots surrounding it are all commercial, already zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| Director Brooks, are they already zoned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| You said they're not recognized as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| They're zoned commercial, but there's some that are off of Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| The ones that are off of Oak Ridge Highway, not directly adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| are not recognized by the sector plan as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| So they're LDR in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| I'm not sure who was first, Commissioner Schoonmaker or Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| I know Commissioner Smith was last over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| I'll look to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Let's go down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| Yeah, and Mr. Kline, you're referring to page 14 that's in our packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| with the red property that is commercial on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| What you just held up is actually page 14 in our assessment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| It shows all the commercial around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| My question is now to Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:44| Are you with me, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| I'm right here, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| You attend the TPO meetings where Pellissippi Parkway is going to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:57| the interchange there at Oak Ridge Highway and Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| Will they be tying in the road improvements for Oak Ridge Highway at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:08| That I don't know, but I did look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| TDOT has a GIS-based system that they constantly update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| This project, the widening of Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| which goes from its terminus at Shod Road all the way out to Beaver Ridge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| is slated for construction start in the spring of 2027.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| So that's what TDOT is saying right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| that the construction will start out there in 2027 along this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| And will it be two lanes with a center boulevard most likely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| It will match the typical section to the west near Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| It will be a five-lane section, two lanes in either direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| center turn lane and then wide shoulders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| as well as curb and gutter and sidewalk on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| So what Mr. Kline is saying, that on the north side of Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| that corner lot, a good portion of that could be taken by TDOT for the road improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| which in turn then would make his client's lot the corner lot eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| It's hard to predict the future on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| I mean, typically, you know, I would estimate somewhere between 75 and 100 feet of right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| necessary from center line to accommodate all those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| That lot's about 200 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| So I would anticipate, you know, barring, you know, any kind of major conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| that there would be a remainder there between the right-of-way line and the applicant's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| Commissioner Ward and then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| I'm actually very familiar with the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| I've been servicing the landscaping company for seven years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| so it's been around since before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4441)|

| 1:14:07| As a property rights guy, I've got a real hard time saying no in the sense that people across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| which are three properties deep on Mack Road or Mackin Road, there are two properties deep on Wright Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| It goes back three properties, and there's a high-density residential after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4461)|

| 1:14:30| The point that I'm making then behind his house is a giant commercial complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| that does have a recycling center, the Carnes Convenience Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| and all that kind of stuff goes all the way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| I get the point that he's making, and it's hard for me, as a small businessman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| to tell another small businessman, well, yeah, everybody around you is commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| and the property down the street is operating commercial, but not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| It's just I think if he's willing to put up a fence and be a responsible neighbor and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| and have his office there and park his trailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| I think I have similar sentiments to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| I get the point to the neighborhood, but I kind of struggle what everybody else is allowed to do but him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:24| I think we all kind of know once you make this a five-lane road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| there's going to be a bigger demand for commercial up and down this entire road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| You're going to see more conversion going forward, and it's going to change the whole entire feel of this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:38| Some of these properties to the south that are residential touching Upper Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| those are going to be all turned commercial, and this is going to be a commercial corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4543)|

| 1:15:53| I know already some of the vacant property that was vacant seven years ago when I started out in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| has all been developed and has been built out and all that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| and there's just more and more demand as more and more people move into Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| and it becomes more developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| I'm a little bit torn, but I kind of lean towards a yes more than a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| Thank you, Commissioner Ward. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| Mr. Stone, is it a very good possibility that once the widening of the acquisition of right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| takes place for Upper Ridge Highway that the remainder of the current corner lot may be sliced into a parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| that is too small for any kind of development that you would put along a five-lane highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:41| That happens quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| I could easily see that being what we like to refer as an economic remnant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| that it's devalued to the point that it really has very little utility in its current state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| Unless it's combined with an adjacent piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Correct, for assemblage purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| Director Brooks, the two properties across the street that are zone commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| they wound up in the sector plan as LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| This is a lot like what happened in Bex Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| Could that not be called an error in the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| Potentially it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| And legally, if these people wanted to use that land as commercial, since it is zone commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:23| it would be hard to stop them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| It would unless they had to come forward to the planning commission for some type of development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| and then we would look to see what does the sector plan say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| and then they would be asked to go through the process to request the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| Kind of like what happened on Bex Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| Okay, what was the zoning on the Bex Hill property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Was it neighborhood commercial or was it commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| It was commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| General commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| Like Commissioner Ward says, if you look at page 14 and 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| you can see how deep the commercial zone goes along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:09| I think it's a bit forward thinking to go ahead and prepare for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| We're doing an Alcoa, we did the Alcoa corridor study after they widened the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:23| Sometimes it's best to get ahead of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| You can see this width of band on many of these streets goes deeper than this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4706)|
| 1:18:34| This property is surrounded on three sides by commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| I tend to feel like we should, and this failed MPC by a vote of 8-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:49| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| That's a pretty tight vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| I'm of the opinion that perhaps we should send this back to them for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4734)|
| 1:19:03| Can you repeat the last thing you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| I'm of the opinion that perhaps we should send this back to MPC for reconsideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| That's typically the process we have gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| I am not to go to a totally different subject here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| but I think Mr. Kline is absolutely correct that MPC is a recommending body to the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:30| and these things should come straight to us and not have to come here on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| That's how the state statute would all say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| This is my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| I've talked to several of these neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| It is actually not far from where I reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| There has been some misinformation, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| I hope that you all have taken the time to drive down this little road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| because there is no question it is a little residential road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| I don't know how many of those might be rental as opposed to owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:19| but the homes have very nice shards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| It's kept up very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| It's an older community, probably over 50 years, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:32| The homes have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| It's just a quiet little street that's got families on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| that are just enjoying still a little bit of tranquility in the midst of a lot of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:52| I cannot speak to the piece further north with that other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:59| except to say that when you drive down Canal Lane, all you see there is a gravel road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| There's nothing from the sight line on Canal Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| that would even let you know that way back there somewhere is that landscaping business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| If you'll see, it's basically just an access road there that goes to that back business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:28| Even though I suspect, as the word was used, it's part of a legacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:35| I'm not even really sure how relevant it is because it in no way affects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| at least cosmetically, the Canal Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| The two properties directly across the street that are zoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| those have been homes and they've been residential from the moment they were built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| The story about it was changed 50 years ago because someone wanted to open a sewing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| is certainly before my time, but it makes a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| because it's very clear that those two homes are residences and have been from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:20| I mean, regardless of what they're zoned, they are used as residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4940)|
| 1:22:27| I do think that needs to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| As far as looking to the south, talking about the commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| that big red block that you see, I will remind you, is on the opposite side of Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| I mean, it is not, even though technically it's directly across from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4965)|
| 1:22:53| it is a wide road that is going to be even wider in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4973)|
| 1:23:00| that really does not affect that little street at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:11| The wanting to do this because Oak Ridge Highway is going to be widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:20| and Mr. Snowden, I know you'll appreciate it when I say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| it's kind of like I'll believe it when I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| I understand that it is finally in the plan for the DOT, and I do think that that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:36| If they're talking about 2027, I would not be surprised if that doesn't begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:45| probably at the Shaw Road end, since that's where it's four-laned at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| and come down Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| I'm here to tell you it's going to be years and years and years before that widened road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| makes it all the way down to where this turnoff to Pinell Lane is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:10| In summary, these residents are very happy here, this property directly to the south of Pinell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5050)|
| 1:24:24| I actually do understand why that was changed to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| because it's got more frontage on Oak Ridge Highway than it does on Pinell Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| but it is still a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| It still, at this point in time, is a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| So I just—this is a property, and I've told the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| I might not never say never, but even Mr. Ingram, who's appealing for the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:54| states that he's not going to do this because it's leased at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| but we have no guarantee of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| When it's rezoned, that could change overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| So I am not making the motion, unless others still wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:15| Anyway, I will go ahead and make the motion that we uphold the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:25| whether it should have been brought to us or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| Commissioner Smith, I can't speak to at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| but I'm making a motion that we support the denial of the sector-planned amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| to general commercial because it, in fact, is not compatible with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| So I have a motion by Commissioner Hill to deny this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| and to uphold the denial from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5152)|
| 1:26:00| Seconded by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| Commissioner Ward, your line is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| Do we have to give him CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| Is there another zoning that we can give him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| I was thinking, like, neighborhood commercial, that's more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| Since we are the legislative body, do we have a decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Can we make a decision to do something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| I know this is the overlay part, but let me get to the actual zoning part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:28| Based on my understanding of what the applicant wants to do with the outdoor storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| then, yes, I think CA is the most appropriate zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5192)|
| 1:26:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Okay, Commissioner Schoonmaker is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| Commissioner Smith yields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| Ms. Brooks, I was kind of reviewing the comments that my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5209)|
| 1:26:57| Commissioner Ward, was making about the properties that are on Mackin Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| if I'm pronouncing that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| On one map it looks like there's two parcels deep that are commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| and then on another map it just looks like one parcel is commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| closest to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| So I guess I'm looking at your page 15 in your documents, the one, the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| It looks like there's the corner, well, the lot facing, both corner lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| and the lot behind them are commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| Is that what you were referring to before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| So, in other words, the second property in is zone CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| Is that Mr. Snowden shaking his head yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| So we're doing it on the next street over, but we're not in the next street over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| from that, but we don't want to do it on this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| Am I looking at the map correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| And I see Mr. Snowden is shaking his head yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| but I'd like to hear your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Yes, those properties are zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| Okay, so the second residence in is on those two streets is CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| Okay, but the voted Planning Commission, because this is the second one in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| The Planning Commission recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| Denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| I make a motion that we send this back to MPC for reconsideration of the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| Is that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| I have a substitute motion that we send this back to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| for reconsideration on the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| Second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| The motion is by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| Commissioner Smith, can you talk about the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| Help me understand the mechanics of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| If this body were to vote to send it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| we're sending it back just to say reconsider the first time you passed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| With any, I mean, and they just take it up again and send it back to us with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5358)|
| 1:29:25| Mr. Brooks, I believe that Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| this is the procedure we have in place for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| I was just asking Director Moyers about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| I don't know where in our procedures it says that it needs to go back to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| I mean, you all are the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| I know, but I've not been able to find where that is codified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| that it has to go back to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| I mean, Planning Commission is going, unless they're requesting something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| I don't know that you'll receive something different from Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| I mean, I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| I'm not going to speak on behalf of all 15 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| So you're saying there is no need to send it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| I have not found anywhere that's been codified that it should come back to the Planning Commission for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5405)|
| 1:30:12| You all are the legislative body and make the final decision on these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| I guess that's what I was kind of getting to, is what is that going to do for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| That's just how we've always done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| Mr. Oden, is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| We're learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| There's all kinds of things that have been done, one way that probably shouldn't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| I don't know how it takes an appeal to get it here when we're the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| It is someone's right to be judged from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| So with that, I would like to amend my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| Could I ask one more question before you do any amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| Mr. Moyers, can you just clarify this legality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Would you ask the question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| I've been engaged in a couple of discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| The question was, it's been a long practice that sometimes when we're stuck on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| we might send it back to the Planning Commission for further consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| but Ms. Brooks says she can't figure out why we've done that or where it says we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| I'm tempted to think of the definition of insanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| One thing that occurs to me, and I was talking to Director Brooks about this and to Mr. Klein as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| is that a more restrictive possibility would be the PC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:28| The PC zone is a zone that is, I'll just read it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| is not the intent of the zone to restrict potential development by limiting uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| In general, uses permitted shall include office, commercial services, and light distribution centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| which sounds fairly much in line with what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| But the advantage, and the PC zone would allow him to do outdoor storage like of his truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| but it states, if I can find it again, that parking and loading requirements are specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5513)|
| 1:32:01| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| No parking shall be permitted in the front yard of any structure constructed on the individual lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| unless such parking is landscaped with trees, shrubs, grass islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| But the great advantage of the PC here is that to do his development, to do his office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| the applicant would be required to get a development plan approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| So all of these things that we would want to see on this property, the Planning Commission can assure happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:27| And so he could have that zone, and he doesn't have to do anything with it until he says he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| But then, like I said, you have another check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| because Planning Commission would have to approve his development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| before he was allowed to build anything else on that property or do the parking or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| So let's assume he, let's assume the applicant would be open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| Do we have the legal authority during an appeal to say we, is that two separate motions or is it a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| we uphold the denial but approve the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| Let me speak to that because I've spoken with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Those are two different worlds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| I've spoken to Director Brooks about this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| I don't know how this came to pass, this appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| But here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Zoning is a legislative act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| You are the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| I think Mr. Klein will agree with me on this, probably vociferously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| When an applicant applies for a rezoning or sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| the Planning Commission simply does not have the authority to veto that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| They don't, they can recommend against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| But the ultimate power to zone or rezone rests with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| And I do not understand why, if they vote against something, the applicant has to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| Any application should automatically appear before this body because this is the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| that disposes of the application, not the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| Its role is to advise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| If I was really, really a stickler about it and I was going to send it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| I would send it back to say, what would you say to PC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| But I wouldn't just send it back to say, well, look at it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| and come up with something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| So do you believe it would be a, if the applicant was interested in PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| do you believe it would be a proper motion to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| What would be the motion to go from a denial of X to a new thing of Y?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| If I may, we're on a sector plan right now, though, not zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| so we still have to take action on this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| And I don't know if their decision would be different with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| but from what I've seen, Director Brooks, did they consider PC at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| I'm not sure if they had that conversation with our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| but in looking at the planned commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| it really is intended for properties of 20 acres or greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| not that there are planned commercial zones that are less than 20 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| but there could be some challenges with, such as the peripheral boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| which is all buildings shall be set back at least 50 feet from any boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| of the project or any public street or road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| So there might be some challenges based on the size of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| All right, well, it was a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| I think I'm done with my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| Let me jump in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| So would his building be grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| He's not building new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| It's already a preexisting building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| We changed the zone to PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| The only thing we're saying is you have to build your driveway to go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| the back of your house, landscape, put your fence up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| It kind of blocks it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| It locks him in so he has to only use the house as the house currently exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| because if he was to build anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| you'd have to build it back 50 feet, knock down his house, and redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| So it kind of locks him in even more if you just put him in a PC zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| and say, hey, man, you can operate your business out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| You can put your trucks behind your house, landscape your house up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| They'll approve it, and you're off to the races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| Everybody's good to go because it's already existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| We're not talking about him building a brand-new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| We're just talking about him usage of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| So, yes, I know it's not the common thing to be using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| but if we do this, it locks him in where he can't develop that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| any further than it currently is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| It's kind of what everybody wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| We don't want the neighborhood to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| We just want to allow him to operate his business as a building, as an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| and maybe he lives upstairs or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| and then he has his truck behind his house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| which is more than 50 feet away from the building because he has an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| and he's allowed to work on his truck and store his truck behind his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| I don't want to speak on behalf of Knox County Codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| if they would look at it as, I guess, legal nonconforming in that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5801)|
| 1:36:46| but that would make—I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| It's creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| I don't know if it would be nonconforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| because we would be putting it in nonconformance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| Let me challenge you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| It looks like it's about 45 feet from the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| so maybe it does meet the 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| It's kind of hard to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| It's possible, but I think from Codes' perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| I don't know if we could consider it, to your words, grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:28| Could or could not consider it grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| I don't think we could necessarily because I think we would be—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| Would you force them to knock it down and build a new building then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| You'd be changing the use is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| What generally gets grandfathered are uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| What generally gets grandfathered are uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Now, the building might be grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| If you rezoned it and the house itself was too close to peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| and people were still living in the house, then that would be grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| But I think if once they started using it as a commercial establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| then it would no longer be grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| because once you change the use, a grandfathered use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| you lose the grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| I try to jump outside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| Mr. Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| First thing we've got to do is we've got to deal with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| What we've got to do is we've got to deal with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| before we can talk about any zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| Are we going to change the sector plan or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| I'm going to direct this to Director Moyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| because Commissioner Smith is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| We have in the past done things this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| We had this debate about the Rutledge Pike property for a really long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| a couple of different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| My question is, does this body have legislative authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| to change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| You are the only body that has that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| Did you want to make an amendment to your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| I want to give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| If, in fact, this body does have the authority to change a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:39| I would still like to maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5979)|
| 1:39:46| Just because it's happened down the road does not make it okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:55| a street or two streets over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| if, in fact, those are not just heavily residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| but virtually all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| We are getting squeezed as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| As I said, I would never say never on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| but at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| especially trying to use Oak Ridge Highway as the reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| knowing that that is years away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| I'm just not sure that it's wise for us to base so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:31| on what might be happening years away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6036)|

| 1:40:53| I've been watching them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Yes, that's something that we try to make sure that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| when they make their motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| So if we change the sector plan tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| I feel like, and the law director may shoot me down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| we've got to give a reason to change that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| The conditions are right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| Change that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| So whoever makes the motion to change that sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| needs to tell us which conditions have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| I would like to give that opportunity to Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| I think what you're asking me, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| is what are the conditions that are changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| that allow a sector plan change by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| because this body is the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| There has been expansion of the GC land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| and the CA and CB zoning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6112)|

| 1:42:01| Once right-of-way acquisition and widening of Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6121)|

| 1:42:25| because the parcel will end up being right at the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| of Oak Ridge Highway and Pennell Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6149)|

| 1:42:39| has changed the character of the residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| Pennell Lane is now primarily rental homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| but renters are getting harder to locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| There has been complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| Mr. Ingram brought them to your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| of the Carnes waste site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| And the growth in the existing GC land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| in this area is so much so that this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| has commercial zoning on three sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| Those are the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| You still have, oh, you, Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| I have a comment to make, but I'll yield to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| In response to that, we are as desperate in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:31| for rentals as we are for homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| So we have to be very careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| We have to be very careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6217)|

| 1:43:45| So to make that statement, I believe, is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:54| To use the excuse of the convenience center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| which you cannot even see from the houses on Pennell Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:03| as a reason to, well, go ahead and change this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| when, in fact, I'd be first to admit I wouldn't want one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| on the next street over from me either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| but I will tell you this convenience center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| has been a wonderful partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| They do not omit any odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| They do not have traffic issues that affect Pennell Lane at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| and they are not visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| They are tucked away just like you would want it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| and to suddenly, because they're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| to dismiss that as a negative when, in fact, it has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| is just an incorrect assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| Ms. Taylor, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| I would like to say that it's not mostly rentals, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| We've said that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| He repeated everything he said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| and he talked about one backhoe and a truck on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| From the USDOT site, he's been approved for three drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| because he is operating and reporting three drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| and five power units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| I'm not sure what all that means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| but that's a lot more equipment than one backhoe and one trailer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| on that small piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| And I would like to say, as Ms. Hill has been saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| just because we've done stuff in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| doesn't mean we should do it moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Allowing the property at 6909 Pennell Lane to become commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| further encroaches on the residential street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| understanding that lines must be drawn somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6329)|

| 1:45:43| will not benefit the other residents of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| In fact, it will reduce the rather quaint single-living street area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6347)|

| 1:46:07| I'll ask again, please deny changing the zoning here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| to allow this commercial property in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| and even the next one that you've got for general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6376)|

| 1:46:20| Thank you, Chairman Bieler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| Mr. Ingram, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| Can you tell me a couple things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Number one, what equipment are you going to have on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| I've got a bobcat, a trailer, and a mini excavator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| A mini excavator and a bobcat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| So it would be what size trailer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| It's a tandem 14,000-pound tag-along trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| How much time do you spend on this property right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:52| At Pendle Lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| I haven't rented out. I'm not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| If it wasn't rented out, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| because it's going to be rented until the widening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| how much time would you spend housing your equipment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| 90% of the time, my equipment goes from one job to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| And sometimes it stays on site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| So any time that your renters have been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| at the 6927 Pendle Lane, the WAG Properties LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| that's three houses up from you on the left that has that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| what size equipment do they have that they take in and out of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| They have one-ton trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| and there's 25, 30 employees that go and come all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| So they're operating what kind of business center there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| two houses up from you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| Landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Landscape, the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| The gas station diagonally from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| what time do you know their hours by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| They close at 9 or 10, so we can't use commercial traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:52| The reason I'm asking these things is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| It's somewhere around 10, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| It's not late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| It's not midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| So we have noise ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| and the law director was talking about buffers with specific zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| and stuff like that being neighborhood friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| My question to you is your legal counsel stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| that your neighbors on both sides were fine with this, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| But would you be compliant if we were to put in a stipulation for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| that they're used to put in a buffer on your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| so people can't see things from the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| Like maybe a screening or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| So like Commissioner Ward said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| pulling your trucks and traffic and things around behind your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Because, Director Morris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| we can put requirements and things such, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| I think a buffer, I don't think you can limit his use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| but you can probably say that there's a buffer required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| between the commercial property and the residential property, if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| Because I know this area really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| and I know it's zone commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| but some of my friends are iron workers at the very back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| Literally, your property is right behind the convenience center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| but on that exact same road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| there's dye machines and everything back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| So I know it's loud in the middle of the day and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| so I'm inclined more to go with what Commissioner Smith is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| and trying to see if there's something we can make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| Exceptionally, two doors up from you with a large company that's operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| I just didn't know if everybody else was looking at the same property I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| Mr. Ingram, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| would you state your name and address for the clerk's record since you spoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6572)|

| 1:49:46| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to withdraw my motion, if it's okay with the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6586)|

| 1:49:53| And I would like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| Withdraw your motion since it becomes the main motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| Withdraw your motion. Is there another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| There's a main motion, so you can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| I got one on the lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| Chairman, I'd like to make a motion that we approve a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6614)|
| 1:50:21| from LDR to General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| I have a motion, a substitute motion by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| to approve a sector plan amendment, which would be to grant this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:39| as it's stated, to General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| Do I have a motion to award?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| Yes, Ms. Taylor, you'll be given an opportunity as soon as Commissioner Daly speaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| I hate to keep asking questions, but this will determine my vote, either yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| The commercial property that they keep talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| was that before the sector plan changed six years ago or after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| You're referring to the property on the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| The property that they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| It's already zoned commercial. When was it zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| Before the sector plan update or after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| Before, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| So there's nothing to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| I would offer that the change would be the extension of CA and CB zoning along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| We have zoned a-this commission recently zoned a large portion of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| to the east of this property before, was it Beaver Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| A large portion of CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| Ms. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| I think you guys said it was page 14 where you've got the maps with the red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| When he's talking about the commercial property two houses down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| if you'll look at that, there's lot number 33 and 35 and a little tiny road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| That's the only-there is no commercial property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| and Ms. Hill was making reference to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| The commercial property is way back here in this red zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| It's just a driveway is all that it is on Pinnell Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| You can't even tell there's a landscaping company back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| It's literally a gravel driveway with a gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| You can see nothing about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| and there's not 40 or 50 trucks a day coming down that hill either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| It's much less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| I spent a good bit of time there with my daughter and my granddaughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=6747)|

| 1:57:29| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission deny CA General Business zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| because it is not compatible with the adjacent residential neighborhood by a vote of 11-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| Mr. Kline, you may offer comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| My understanding is, Commissioners, that you can't rezone it unless you have a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| So, you just denied the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| So, if we can withdraw this at this point, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| You can check with your lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| No motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| I think if he wishes to withdraw the request, he should be allowed to withdraw the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| That takes it off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| As long as it's in front of the board, there needs to be some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| If he withdraws it, then that's no actions further than necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| Commissioner Jay, did you have a response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| I thought in the rules we changed the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| I'm pretty sure we changed the rules where you can't withdraw the day of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| I think we changed the rules that you can't postpone the day of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| No, I think it was with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7110)|
| 1:58:37| I just want to make sure we... I remember us working on a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| I'm trying to pull it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| The applicant can withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| It's happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| And that way, he keeps open his option to bring it back at another time with another fee and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| If we act on it, it's denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| He has to wait a whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| No, no, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| I'm not looking to tie up any ways to land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| I just know we dealt with... we had this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| I want to make sure we're compliant with our own rules before he...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:11| I'm pulling up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| I'm trying to look as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| Somebody can find it before I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:26| It says zoning applicants must make postponement and withdrawal requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7166)|
| 1:59:32| no later than 4 p.m. on the Wednesday in advance of the zoning session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| So under your rules, withdrawal would not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| I think we specifically addressed this because in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| people had come up for a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| And when they started to read the tea leaves that they weren't going to get the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| they would do a quick, I'm out of here bailout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| And the public would have put the time in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| And we went through...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| This was sort of to close a loophole that was happening more and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| where people felt like they were going to lose the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| Now, I think this is different because we denied one, so we deny the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| It's a combo deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| But I remember us addressing that in rules because we had several instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| I think the first year I was here where people all of a sudden went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| uh-oh, and they bailed out fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| Commissioner Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| Is it possible to include in the motion that the fee that was charged by NOx planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:34| that we recommend that that fee be returned since you shouldn't have to pay a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| to the legislative body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| I would totally agree with that premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| I don't know if it's appropriate for us to take that action without reworking the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7245)|
| 2:00:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| I think he's wording it in terms of a request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| so it would be up to the body to collect the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| But we need to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| Now, I would just remind the chairman and the body that we can suspend the rules at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7261)|
| 2:01:06| If this was an adverse action that we didn't think about with the combo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| when we closed that loophole, we could always suspend the rules with two-thirds vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| and take a different action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| We could also postpone this rezoning or this denial of the rezoning for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7278)|
| 2:01:25| and let them work through the sector plan or get through advanced NOx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| So there's lots of actions we can take without just tying up a piece of land for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7289)|
| 2:01:36| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:41| Or we could just vote to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7301)|
| 2:01:48| That would not be the applicant withdrawing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| It would be us withdrawing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| I think if you included in your motion to suspend the rules and allow the applicant to withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7317)|
| 2:02:05| we can just vote on that and if we get eight votes, they can withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:12| Would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| I make a motion we suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| And allow the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| Motion by Commissioner Buster, second by Commissioner Smith to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| and allow the applicant to withdraw this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| That motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7359)|

| 2:02:43| Madam Clerk, we are about to head to item 58, or rather 59,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:50| and I would like to take a break before we entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| So we will be…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| Well, we can wait until the very end, even after the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| We'll reconvene at 925.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-zoning-part-1?start=7381)|
