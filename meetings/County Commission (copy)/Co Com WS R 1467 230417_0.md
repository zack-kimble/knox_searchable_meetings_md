| 0:04:42| Barbara Kelly, 5738 Sunrise Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=282.0)|
| 0:04:49| And thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=289.0)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier, for setting up this time for us and for a briefing on Head Start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=291.0)|
| 0:04:58| And thank each one of you for your time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=298.0)|
| 0:05:01| I think most of you know that City of Knoxville and Knox County created CAC about 60 years ago to meet the needs of low-income people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=301.0)|
| 0:05:12| seniors, unemployed, and other folks requiring special services and assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=312.0)|
| 0:05:19| and to mobilize primarily financial grant funds to carry out that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=319.0)|
| 0:05:25| And, as I said, that was almost 60 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=325.0)|
| 0:05:28| And, of course, the mix of programs and services based on the resources in need have changed over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=328.0)|
| 0:05:38| But Head Start has always been an essential part of the CAC network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=338.0)|
| 0:05:45| And so we're pleased to have a chance to brief you on Head Start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=345.0)|
| 0:05:51| And, actually, Renee Hagee is here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=351.0)|
| 0:05:54| And she has only been with us for 36 years, providing outstanding services to children and families in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=354.0)|
| 0:06:07| So I'm going to turn you over to Renee at this point, and I'm happy to see our PowerPoint up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=367.0)|
| 0:06:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=377.0)|
| 0:06:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=378.0)|
| 0:06:19| Go ahead, Renee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=379.0)|
| 0:06:22| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=382.0)|
| 0:06:23| I am Renee Hagee, and I am the director of the Knoxville-Knox County Head Start Program, a program of the Community Action Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=383.0)|
| 0:06:31| And I appreciate the time tonight to be able to share a little bit about the Head Start Program with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=391.0)|
| 0:06:39| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=399.0)|
| 0:06:42| The Head Start Program serves children from low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=402.0)|
| 0:06:47| We are currently funded to serve 743 preschoolers aged 3 to 5 years old and 144 infants and toddlers, the birth to 3 age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=407.0)|
| 0:06:58| These children are from very low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=418.0)|
| 0:07:01| Just for context, approximately 70% of our enrolled families make less than $20,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=421.0)|
| 0:07:09| On the next slide, and I would like to point out that these slides are actual children, and these photographs were taken by our Head Start teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=429.0)|
| 0:07:19| So these children come to us in great need, and Head Start is here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=439.0)|
| 0:07:23| Our main goal is school readiness for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=443.0)|
| 0:07:27| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=447.0)|
| 0:07:29| When our children leave us, we want them to be physically healthy, because we all know that it's harder to learn when you are sick or hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=449.0)|
| 0:07:38| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=458.0)|
| 0:07:41| We also want them to be socially competent and able to get along with others in a group and able to manage their emotions and behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=461.0)|
| 0:07:50| And finally, next slide, we want them to be academically ready, ready to face the academic rigors of whatever school environment they find themselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=470.0)|
| 0:08:00| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=480.0)|
| 0:08:02| Head Start is a comprehensive program, offering services to children and families in a variety of areas, health services, nutrition services, social services to families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=482.0)|
| 0:08:12| transportation, support for dual-language learners, mental health services, parent support and parent education, and of course, education services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=492.0)|
| 0:08:23| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=503.0)|
| 0:08:25| This is tough work, and we rely on our frontline staff to help us with this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=505.0)|
| 0:08:33| Our program today has great needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=513.0)|
| 0:08:37| In our classrooms, we are serving children with significant disabilities, autism, sensory processing disorders, and developmental delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=517.0)|
| 0:08:46| We are working with children who have significant health needs as well, children undergoing chemotherapy, children with ileostomy bags, children with serious allergies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=526.0)|
| 0:08:57| And we are working with children with significant mental health challenges, which often present in the form of challenging behaviors in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=537.0)|
| 0:09:06| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=546.0)|
| 0:09:09| As I said before, we rely on our frontline staff to meet these high needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=549.0)|
| 0:09:15| Our teachers, our teacher assistants, and our family specialists support our children and families in addressing these needs, which brings me to the challenges that Head Start is facing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=555.0)|
| 0:09:26| We have experienced a significant staffing crisis at Head Start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=566.0)|
| 0:09:31| We have 13 of our preschool classes that we have not been able to open this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=571.0)|
| 0:09:37| Why are these classes closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=577.0)|
| 0:09:39| Because we do not have enough teachers and teacher assistants to be able to open those classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=579.0)|
| 0:09:44| There are several issues that contribute to this problem, but one of the issues is teacher compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=584.0)|
| 0:09:50| We have lost a number of experienced, highly qualified teachers to the school system due to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=590.0)|
| 0:09:56| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=596.0)|
| 0:09:58| Just for comparison, let's look at a teacher with a bachelor's degree in early childhood education with pre-K certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=598.0)|
| 0:10:05| In actual dollars, that teacher working in the Head Start program would make $33,400 in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=605.0)|
| 0:10:13| That same teacher working in the Knox County school system would make $43,077.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=613.0)|
| 0:10:21| This is a disparity that we are trying to address, and this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=621.0)|
| 0:10:26| If we don't fix this staffing issue, we stand to lose a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=626.0)|
| 0:10:30| We could potentially lose federal dollars, and our Head Start program brings in about $15 million to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=630.0)|

| 0:12:13| Walked out of there feeling probably overwhelmed at not even close to how overwhelmed you have to feel sometimes of everything that you do for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=733.0)|
| 0:12:25| and so many things that we didn't realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=745.0)|
| 0:12:28| So as a new commissioner, it was really important for me to know everything that you guys do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=748.0)|
| 0:12:33| and the Head Start program is just one of them that is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=753.0)|
| 0:12:37| But equally, every one of your programs is so important to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=757.0)|
| 0:12:42| And so I just want to thank you all for what you do and the time that you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=762.0)|
| 0:12:47| and the heart that you have for the kids and for the community, and I really mean that from the bottom of my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=767.0)|

| 0:12:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=779.0)|
| 0:13:01| I want to thank you all for coming and accepting my invitation to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=781.0)|
| 0:13:06| I have the great privilege of serving on the CAC board thanks to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=786.0)|
| 0:13:11| and I get to hear from them monthly and the updates and also the challenges that they face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=791.0)|
| 0:13:19| I was also lucky enough several years ago to go through their leadership program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=799.0)|
| 0:13:24| and it was at that time that I realized as a citizen and as communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=804.0)|
| 0:13:29| we really have no idea and don't appreciate the depth and breadth of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=809.0)|
| 0:13:36| and programs that CAC provides to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=816.0)|
| 0:13:42| It's really amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=822.0)|
| 0:13:43| If you have not been able to stop by the Community Action Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=823.0)|
| 0:13:47| if you have not been able to step foot in the Head Start locations, I encourage you to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=827.0)|
| 0:13:54| Those faces, the smiles on those faces, that's what you see when you walk into that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=834.0)|
| 0:13:59| Those children are so happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=839.0)|
| 0:14:02| They are so confident, and they are so loved and cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=842.0)|
| 0:14:07| They're some amazing staff, and for several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=847.0)|
| 0:14:11| I have heard at the board meetings that the classes are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=851.0)|
| 0:14:17| We can't open classes and serve these families, and it's because of staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=857.0)|
| 0:14:23| and it's because of the shortfall, and so this commission will learn fairly quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=863.0)|
| 0:14:31| that the Community Action Center has reached out to both the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=871.0)|
| 0:14:34| to request some additional funds to help them with the staffing shortfalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=874.0)|
| 0:14:39| because, as I mentioned, not being able to serve those children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=879.0)|
| 0:14:42| means that parents oftentimes will have to stay home with their children rather than go to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=882.0)|
| 0:14:48| and so this is a multi-layered issue, and I'm just so thankful to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=888.0)|
| 0:14:54| and thankful to my colleagues for really listening and visiting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=894.0)|

| 1:48:36| Seeing none, thank you, sir, for applying and we will see you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6516.4800000000005)|
| 1:48:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6520.4800000000005)|
| 1:48:42| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6522.4800000000005)|
| 1:48:45| Ms. Tina Watts, did you happen to make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6525.4800000000005)|
| 1:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6530.4800000000005)|
| 1:48:51| Maybe we will reach out to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6531.4800000000005)|
| 1:48:54| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6534.4800000000005)|
| 1:48:57| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6537.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:00| I guess really they need to be addressed to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6540.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:04| This first one probably more to Commissioner Oster since she has been on the Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6544.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:11| Is it the role, Commissioner, of a Merit Board member to investigate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6551.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:20| The information will be given from the officer or his or her attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6560.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:26| and then the sheriff will also give their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6566.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:31| But there is a limited scope of what the council can be investigating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6571.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6575.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:36| Because I did hear a couple of applicants say, yeah, you know, I can keep an open mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6576.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:41| but I would have to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6581.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:43| So that kind of got my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6583.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:45| And maybe they were saying that they kind of wanted to hear both sides of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6585.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:48| which I am fine with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6588.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:50| I just don't want to hear that they have made up a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6590.4800000000005)|
| 1:49:56| because they have a personal feeling about that particular officer or that particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6596.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:02| But it's not their role to personally go out and be asking questions and investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6602.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6608.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6609.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:10| And the second question I have, and this really goes to one of our rules about political activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6610.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:16| one of our applicants was honest enough to put down that he's vice president of a local Republican club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6616.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:25| So what do we do with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6625.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:29| I mean, how can you â€“ and personally, I think it shows a position of leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6629.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:35| and it's a good thing to be able to put down that you step up and, you know, you help clubs out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6635.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:44| But I see Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6644.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:47| Yeah, I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6647.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:50| It's actually very specifically spelled out that all board members â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6650.4800000000005)|
| 1:50:56| it lays out what apolitical looks like, and it essentially says, look, you can still vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6656.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:01| you can still go to political clubs, and certainly you have your own personal political positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6661.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:10| But it prohibits participating in campaigns, donating to campaigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6670.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:17| and actively participating in other political functions beyond voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6677.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:22| and attending a political â€“ you know, a civic political meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6682.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:27| And the intention of that is that it takes people away from â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6687.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:34| in years past there has been all kinds of accusations of people that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6694.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:40| for this one particular party or one particular candidate or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6700.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:44| and it sort of stripped away, you know, the sort of â€“ the basics of that and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6704.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:50| yes, you can participate in political clubs and you can vote and have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6710.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:53| but, you know, to be somebody who's actively out there engaging and supporting â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6713.4800000000005)|
| 1:51:58| in this case, the direct connection point would be a sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6718.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:04| You can't sit on the merit board and go actively campaign for a sheriff's candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6724.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:09| that would, you know, obviously put you in one position or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6729.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:13| So we worked very closely with our law department to craft it in which it was legal and constitutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6733.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:20| but it laid out some very specific actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6740.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:22| And so I'm happy to pull that up in more detail if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6742.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6747.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:28| So I might just ask our law director then to hold an office then in a political club is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6748.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6760.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:41| I mean, I hope it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6761.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6762.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:43| Under the ordinance â€“ I don't have the numbering here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6763.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:48| I need to start bringing a PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6768.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:49| But where it talks about the political aspects of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6769.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:53| it says that nothing in this part shall be construed to prohibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6773.4800000000005)|
| 1:52:57| or prevent any such board member from becoming or continuing to be a member of a political club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6777.4800000000005)|
| 1:53:02| or organization and enjoying all the rights and privileges of such membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6782.4800000000005)|
| 1:53:06| or from attending any political meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6786.4800000000005)|
| 1:53:08| Such board members shall not be denied freedom in the casting of a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6788.4800000000005)|
| 1:53:12| So as Commissioner Jay said, it's more designed to prohibit active participation in specific political campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6792.4800000000005)|
| 1:53:22| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6802.4800000000005)|
| 1:53:23| It does not prohibit you from taking part in political clubs and organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6803.4800000000005)|

| 2:08:40| I had asked to have this pulled because I just wanted a little bit of clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7720.76)|
| 2:08:42| on, in the end, what is the amount going to be per, and I know when I asked per home that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7722.76)|
| 2:08:55| it depends on square footage and all of that, but just a rough estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7735.52)|
| 2:08:59| Just asking, knowing that even though our developers may support it, that in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7739.52)|
| 2:09:04| costs, you know, tend to get passed down to the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7744.52)|
| 2:09:08| So if you could just kind of clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7748.52)|
| 2:09:10| Sure, I'll be glad to, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7750.52)|
| 2:09:12| Yes, we, in preparation of the budget this year, we were looking at that, and we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7752.52)|
| 2:09:18| like that at this point in time we do need a fee increase just to kind of have our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7758.52)|
| 2:09:24| revenue neutral for the services we do provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7764.280000000001)|
| 2:09:26| And this fee, when fully implemented next fiscal year, will do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7766.280000000001)|
| 2:09:31| Essentially, we looked at, there's kind of a matrix that we use, and essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7771.280000000001)|
| 2:09:37| there are 100 to $500,000 homes, probably what's mostly built in a lot of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7777.280000000001)|
| 2:09:45| I did the analysis on that, assuming the home was 2,000 square feet, which is fairly common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7785.280000000001)|
| 2:09:52| The $15 that we proposed this fiscal year would correlate to a $90 permit fee increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7792.04)|
| 2:09:59| for that permit, whereas, you know, next year, assuming the ICC rate stayed about the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7799.04)|
| 2:10:06| it would be another $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7806.04)|
| 2:10:08| So, at the end of the day, if things were to stay somewhat the same, we'd be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7808.04)|
| 2:10:14| at less than $200 per 2,000 square foot home valued at less than $500,000 in fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7814.8)|
| 2:10:21| 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7821.8)|
| 2:10:22| So, to your point, we want to be conscious of home affordability, but yet cover our costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7822.8)|
| 2:10:27| that we do serve the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7827.8)|
| 2:10:29| And I certainly think that's a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7829.8)|
| 2:10:32| What was alarming was the $15 per square foot I was looking at, and I multiplied that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7832.8)|
| 2:10:39| and I thought, that's thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7839.8)|
| 2:10:42| So, that's just an arbitrary...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7842.56)|
| 2:10:45| That's how we value the home, and then that valuation gets plugged into a chart, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7845.56)|
| 2:10:51| that chart defines the permit value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7851.56)|
| 2:10:54| So, it's not a direct correlation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7854.56)|
| 2:10:57| There's another filter that goes on in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7857.56)|
| 2:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7860.56)|

| 2:11:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7865.56)|
| 2:11:07| Mr. Snowden, you're short on inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7867.320000000001)|
| 2:11:10| You may not be short on inspectors, but you sure could use some, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7870.320000000001)|
| 2:11:15| We could, Commissioner, and it's funny you say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7875.320000000001)|
| 2:11:17| That's one of the things, when we met with the development community, we wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7877.320000000001)|
| 2:11:21| is, as part of this fee increase, we would be looking to hire a couple of key staff in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7881.320000000001)|
| 2:11:28| what we would consider to be the critical path process, which one is inspection, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7888.320000000001)|
| 2:11:33| the other is probably zoning review, because obviously, if we're charging more, we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7893.080000000001)|
| 2:11:37| to provide even a better service than what we currently do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7897.080000000001)|
| 2:11:40| So, there will be some additional staff hired as part of this fee increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7900.080000000001)|
| 2:11:44| It's my understanding that the building community, no kickback from them, they actually would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7904.080000000001)|
| 2:11:50| like to see more inspectors, because as soon as they get their inspection, they can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7910.080000000001)|
| 2:11:54| into the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7914.080000000001)|
| 2:11:56| So, hopefully, this will work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7916.080000000001)|
| 2:11:58| I'm for it, and hopefully we can get some funds coming in to hire those personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7918.84)|
| 2:12:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7925.84)|
| 2:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7926.84)|
| 2:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7928.84)|
| 2:12:09| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7929.84)|
| 2:12:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7931.84)|
| 2:12:13| Mr. Snowden, I had some concerns just due to our housing shortage and the cost of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7933.84)|
| 2:12:22| going up, that these costs are going to be passed on as well to buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7942.6)|
| 2:12:28| So, it's my understanding you said $90, but then you said less than $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7948.6)|
| 2:12:34| So, I'm kind of confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7954.6)|
| 2:12:36| You said $90 a permit, then you said somewhere less than $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7956.6)|
| 2:12:39| So, was there two price increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7959.6)|
| 2:12:41| I'm sorry, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7961.6)|
| 2:12:42| I should have been clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7962.6)|
| 2:12:44| It's a phased-in approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7964.6)|
| 2:12:46| We don't want to make all this adjustment in one fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7966.6)|
| 2:12:51| So, we are going up $15 per the square foot evaluation proposed July 1 of 2023, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7971.360000000001)|
| 2:12:59| we're going to index the valuation or essentially the second tier of that increase for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7979.360000000001)|
| 2:13:08| fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7988.360000000001)|
| 2:13:09| So, it would be a $90 increase this fiscal year proposed, and then another $90 approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7989.360000000001)|
| 2:13:15| for the fiscal year 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7995.360000000001)|
| 2:13:17| So, it'd be broke out over two fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7997.360000000001)|
| 2:13:21| Based on a 2,000 square foot home, what is the permit cost now, currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8001.120000000001)|
| 2:13:27| It's going to vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8007.120000000001)|

| 2:13:33| Let me find that chart, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8013.120000000001)|
| 2:13:38| It starts out at, there's a flat fee if your house was, the fee is $490 for the first $100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8018.120000000001)|
| 2:13:50| and then each $1,000 thereafter, you add $3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8030.88)|
| 2:13:57| So, it depends on the valuation of the home, and that's where we're using, we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8037.88)|
| 2:14:04| to tie it to the building evaluation data, the ICC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8044.88)|
| 2:14:08| So, how is that compared nationwide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8048.88)|
| 2:14:10| I'm sorry, ma'am, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8050.88)|
| 2:14:12| How does that compare on rates nationwide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8052.88)|
| 2:14:16| We've talked to several of our builders locally, and they've told us that our permit fees are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8056.64)|
| 2:14:22| quite a bit lower than most of our peer jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8062.64)|
| 2:14:25| We have, what we do is kind of a package permit fee to where it's all included, whereas a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8065.64)|
| 2:14:36| lot of jurisdictions we looked at had more of an a la carte type situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8076.64)|
| 2:14:41| So, the ones we looked at, the city, the town, and surrounding counties, we were the lowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8081.400000000001)|
| 2:14:48| in reference to the same square footage of a home in relation to the permit fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8088.400000000001)|
| 2:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8092.400000000001)|
| 2:14:53| Then I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8093.400000000001)|
| 2:14:54| Okay, so if this is to offset getting quicker inspections, so if you're going to basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8094.400000000001)|
| 2:15:02| $200 on a 2,000 square foot house, what happens if the inspections don't get quicker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8102.400000000001)|
| 2:15:11| If it's the recourse, you're going to raise the price, but then the builders don't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8111.160000000001)|
| 2:15:15| their inspections quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8115.160000000001)|
| 2:15:17| I think we, obviously, we're not going to do them any slower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8117.160000000001)|
| 2:15:23| What we would like to do is, obviously, we try to be within the same week of inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8123.160000000001)|
| 2:15:30| If someone calls, we try to be within five business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8130.160000000001)|
| 2:15:34| Right now, we're a little outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8134.160000000001)|
| 2:15:36| So, I think with these new employees, we can be within that one week window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8136.92)|
| 2:15:43| That is our projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8143.92)|
| 2:15:45| Okay, so there's no repercussions on the county if they don't get out there any sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8145.92)|
| 2:15:51| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8151.92)|
| 2:15:52| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8152.92)|
| 2:15:53| I mean, we can, and we've looked at using contracted inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8153.92)|
| 2:15:57| If we do get behind, that is an option we can do that, you know, should we get really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8157.92)|
| 2:16:04| behind, we can use these fees to do some contracted inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8164.68)|
| 2:16:07| But it's our goal to maintain an inspection within one working week or five business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8167.68)|
| 2:16:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8173.68)|

| 2:16:26| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8186.68)|
| 2:16:27| We met with a lot of the home builders, the executive director of the home builders, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8187.68)|

| 2:16:38| There was no grave concern expressed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8198.44)|
| 2:16:42| I mean, I think we all have to realize that housing prices are up and prices are up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8202.44)|
| 2:16:48| everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8208.44)|
| 2:16:49| So, I appreciate you bringing this because we do need more inspectors, but we've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8209.44)|
| 2:16:54| got to make it where it's revenue neutral and it's not costing the county for the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8214.44)|
| 2:16:59| to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8219.44)|
| 2:17:01| So, you kind of have to make it work for the county and for the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8221.2)|
| 2:17:03| So, I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8223.2)|
| 2:17:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8225.2)|
