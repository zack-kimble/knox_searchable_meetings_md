| 4:31:13| Yes, Councilwoman Rodgers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16273)|
| 4:31:14| sorry, Councilwoman Parker, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16274)|
| 4:31:18| I was just wondering if, should we read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16278)|
| 4:31:24| this slide as saying that our number one priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16284)|
| 4:31:29| is managing complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16289)|
| 4:31:33| No, that was not my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16293)|
| 4:31:36| My intent was that with what data we're getting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16296)|
| 4:31:41| that we can increase social service interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16301)|
| 4:31:45| with as many of those camps as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16305)|
| 4:31:47| because some of the data that's coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16307)|
| 4:31:49| are camps that our outreach teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16309)|
| 4:31:52| are not aware of in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16312)|
| 4:31:54| Some of them are, but others are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16314)|
| 4:32:00| Thank you for explaining that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16320)|
| 4:32:01| because it was reading wrong to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16321)|
| 4:32:04| It was sending the wrong message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16324)|
| 4:32:07| I really wish it was at the bottom of the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16327)|
| 4:32:10| Yeah, I'm sorry for that, that's not my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16330)|
| 4:32:14| Yes, Councilwoman Rodgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16334)|
| 4:32:16| So to clarify and piggyback on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16336)|
| 4:32:19| one of the things that I talk with neighborhoods about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16339)|
| 4:32:22| well, mostly back when we used to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16342)|
| 4:32:24| to go to neighborhood meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16344)|
| 4:32:26| was how do they connect the social service workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16346)|
| 4:32:29| the outreach team with homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16349)|
| 4:32:31| when they see homeless camps or campers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16351)|
| 4:32:36| And unfortunately, the only models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16356)|
| 4:32:40| that the citizens know of is to call KPD or 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16360)|
| 4:32:45| so non-emergency or 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16365)|
| 4:32:47| So the community members who speak with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16367)|
| 4:32:53| will reach out to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16373)|
| 4:32:54| and I've been sending some of those to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16374)|
| 4:32:56| In the past, I would contact Gabe at BMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16376)|
| 4:32:59| to get the social workers out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16379)|
| 4:33:01| So is what you're saying is to come up with a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16381)|
| 4:33:04| let's take the word complaint out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16384)|
| 4:33:05| I see where Councilwoman Parker is coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16385)|
| 4:33:08| is a way for people to be able to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16388)|
| 4:33:11| the social workers out versus KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16391)|
| 4:33:14| Yeah, and the way that effectively we're trying to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16394)|
| 4:33:20| is we're trying to route everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16400)|
| 4:33:21| through the Office on Homelessness and to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16401)|
| 4:33:24| So individuals can send what information they have to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16404)|
| 4:33:30| and then I funnel that information to our outreach teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16410)|
| 4:33:33| based on where geographically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16413)|
| 4:33:38| These camps are located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16418)|
| 4:33:40| and then certain outreach teams go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16420)|
| 4:33:43| and visit those encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16423)|
| 4:33:46| So if citizens know to contact 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16426)|
| 4:33:49| then are those calls then routed to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16429)|
| 4:33:52| so that it goes to the social workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16432)|
| 4:33:54| They are being routed to me now, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16434)|
| 4:33:57| But I do want to reiterate to citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16437)|
| 4:34:00| that may be listening to this call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16440)|
| 4:34:02| that if it is a safety or emergency situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16442)|
| 4:34:06| that you feel like you're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16446)|
| 4:34:08| you can still call 911 and reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16448)|
| 4:34:12| This is not a, we're not trying to alter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16452)|
| 4:34:15| necessarily like a crisis response system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16455)|
| 4:34:18| where KPD needs to arrive to deal with a safety situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16458)|
| 4:34:22| We're mostly talking about maybe non-emergency calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16462)|
| 4:34:25| for calls to 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16465)|
| 4:34:28| So if calls go into 911 or the non-emergency KPD number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16468)|
| 4:34:33| because that's all a citizen knows to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16473)|
| 4:34:35| because they don't know to contact me or you or 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16475)|
| 4:34:43| I guess my question is how is that disseminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16483)|
| 4:34:45| Is that something you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16485)|
| 4:34:47| as part of this priority one to deal with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16487)|
| 4:34:49| Because that's been the question in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16489)|
| 4:34:51| Yes, so the way it's working right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16491)|
| 4:34:56| now that we've started this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16496)|
| 4:34:57| and we've only been doing this since about mid-February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16497)|
| 4:35:02| And so what's happening now is those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16502)|
| 4:35:06| that are coming in that are routed to either officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16506)|
| 4:35:10| or Sergeant Clinton, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16510)|
| 4:35:13| or Officer Moret, who is our homelessness unit for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16513)|
| 4:35:19| They're forwarding all that information to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16519)|
| 4:35:22| and I'm coordinating and referring to the outreach teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16522)|
| 4:35:25| to get them there as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16525)|
| 4:35:30| And we're still in the early stages of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16530)|
| 4:35:33| and trying to work out the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16533)|
| 4:35:35| but we're definitely streamlining it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16535)|
| 4:35:37| and getting an effective way to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16537)|
| 4:35:45| I think I saw Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16545)|
| 4:35:47| Becky, did you have your hand raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16547)|
| 4:35:49| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16549)|
| 4:35:50| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16550)|
| 4:35:51| I just wanted to mention that this is a list of priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16551)|
| 4:35:56| for the Office of Homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16556)|
| 4:35:59| but this is not ranked in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16559)|
| 4:36:02| like this is not more important than the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16562)|
| 4:36:07| So I just wanted to make that distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16567)|
| 4:36:12| Yes, I'm sorry if that's not clear either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16572)|
| 4:36:14| Yes, Gabe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16574)|
| 4:36:19| I just wanted to reiterate the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16579)|
| 4:36:21| that if it's a safety concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16581)|
| 4:36:24| to please contact emergency services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16584)|
| 4:36:27| because our social workers, at least for my team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16587)|
| 4:36:34| certainly we will get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16594)|
| 4:36:35| We can get out there much more quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16595)|
| 4:36:36| now that we have more folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16596)|
| 4:36:40| But if it's true safety concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16600)|
| 4:36:48| we might not be able to get there quickly enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16608)|
| 4:36:50| to intervene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16610)|
| 4:36:51| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16611)|
| 4:36:55| I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16615)|
| 4:36:56| that people did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16616)|
| 4:37:00| there was not an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16620)|
| 4:37:01| that we could be like first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16621)|
| 4:37:08| Yeah, thank you, Gabe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16628)|
| 4:37:11| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16631)|
| 4:37:14| Well, I just wanted to also clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16634)|
| 4:37:17| the reason why that struck me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16637)|
| 4:37:18| is because it's been repeated multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16638)|
| 4:37:22| throughout tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16642)|
| 4:37:24| that camps really aren't approached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16644)|
| 4:37:31| until a complaint is made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16651)|
| 4:37:33| that the city does not have just an ongoing plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16653)|
| 4:37:40| or a system in place to daily go around the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16660)|
| 4:37:44| and clear up encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16664)|
| 4:37:45| It's a complaint-driven system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16665)|
| 4:37:48| And with this street outreach coordination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16668)|
| 4:37:56| I still see, whether we're calling it complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16676)|
| 4:38:00| or reports or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16680)|
| 4:38:02| the community members initiating the action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16682)|
| 4:38:07| And I'm wondering, am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16687)|
| 4:38:09| Is there action initiated on behalf of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16689)|
| 4:38:14| outside of those complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16694)|
| 4:38:18| My answer to that question would be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16698)|
| 4:38:22| And that would be just through the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16702)|
| 4:38:25| that we're funding to do this kind of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16705)|
| 4:38:29| So our outreach teams were not brought on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16709)|
| 4:38:32| just to solely participate in this new piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16712)|
| 4:38:37| that we're trying to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16717)|
| 4:38:38| They're constantly out engaging encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16718)|
| 4:38:42| throughout their daily work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16722)|
| 4:38:47| And actually right now, specific to VMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16727)|
| 4:38:51| who is really focused on the downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16731)|
| 4:38:54| and the corridor around Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16734)|
| 4:39:00| most of the referrals I'm making to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16740)|
| 4:39:03| they already are engaged with these camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16743)|
| 4:39:07| and they already know the folks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16747)|
| 4:39:10| So it hasn't been as different, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16750)|
| 4:39:15| when I'm referring to CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16755)|
| 4:39:17| when CAC has a little bit larger geographical area to cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16757)|
| 4:39:22| that they might be getting camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16762)|
| 4:39:24| that they would not have interacted with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16764)|
| 4:39:26| unless we had informed them of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16766)|
| 4:39:30| So the intent is really, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16770)|
| 4:39:33| to one, increase social service interaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16773)|
| 4:39:36| but also increase the number of unsheltered homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16776)|
| 4:39:40| that our outreach teams are connecting with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16780)|
| 4:39:43| And so I would say that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16783)|
| 4:39:45| the city has actions that are outside of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16785)|
| 4:39:49| and that is by funding these programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16789)|
| 4:39:52| to do this type of work just in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16792)|
| 4:39:55| And is there also, once the outreach teams go out to a camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16795)|
| 4:40:00| do outreach teams then report that to KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16800)|
| 4:40:04| And does that begin the process of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16804)|
| 4:40:09| or the timeline for that camp to be cleared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16809)|
| 4:40:13| No, that's not a piece of this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16813)|
| 4:40:21| Is there a system in place like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16821)|
| 4:40:27| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16827)|
| 4:40:28| I mean, we just wanna make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16828)|
| 4:40:29| that any complaint that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16829)|
| 4:40:32| if it does come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16832)|
| 4:40:33| that we make sure that social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16833)|
| 4:40:37| interact with that camp before anything would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16837)|
| 4:40:40| So that would be an intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16840)|
| 4:40:44| And is it the social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16844)|
| 4:40:46| that are informing the camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16846)|
| 4:40:51| of their, you know, pending eviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16851)|
| 4:40:59| and other housing options for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16859)|
| 4:41:03| or who is directing them to other housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16863)|
| 4:41:07| So no, for when a cleaning occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16867)|
| 4:41:12| that notice is given by KPD per city policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16872)|
| 4:41:18| so that there is 72 hours before an individual has to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16878)|
| 4:41:25| So no, those are not coming from our outreach workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16885)|
| 4:41:34| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16894)|
| 4:41:38| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16898)|
| 4:41:38| It's just, I still cannot, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16898)|
| 4:41:41| we've been told that when a camp is cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16901)|
| 4:41:45| there are outreach workers there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16905)|
| 4:41:47| providing support to the campers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16907)|
| 4:41:50| connecting them with services and housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16910)|
| 4:41:53| But the process that you've just described to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16913)|
| 4:41:57| that it seems like the social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16917)|
| 4:42:01| are separate from KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16921)|
| 4:42:04| So-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16924)|
| 4:42:07| These are really good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16927)|
| 4:42:09| And I think Councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16929)|
| 4:42:12| I think that we have some folks here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16932)|
| 4:42:13| who can represent those outreach teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16933)|
| 4:42:16| and sort of how this is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16936)|
| 4:42:18| And so I think what you're referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16938)|
| 4:42:20| is when the Blackstock Camp encampment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16940)|
| 4:42:24| which was a very large and significant encampment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16944)|
| 4:42:26| that had had a lot of outreach interaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16946)|
| 4:42:30| there were outreach workers there throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16950)|
| 4:42:34| And that was the entire encampment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16954)|
| 4:42:38| So I think that Ms. D and Gabe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16958)|
| 4:42:41| both raised their hands at different times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16961)|
| 4:42:44| and can speak to the importance of making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16964)|
| 4:42:47| that there is a clear separation of responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16967)|
| 4:42:52| and interaction, coordinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16972)|
| 4:42:55| but distinct responsibility and action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16975)|
| 4:42:58| that's happening between outreach workers and KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16978)|
| 4:43:01| So I think they both raised their hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16981)|
| 4:43:04| and I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16984)|
| 4:43:05| And I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16985)|
| 4:43:06| Well, and just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16986)|
| 4:43:07| I'm not talking about Blackstock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16987)|
| 4:43:08| I'm talking about the encampment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16988)|
| 4:43:09| that was cleared this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16989)|
| 4:43:10| I'm talking about every encampment that's cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16990)|
| 4:43:13| on the city's website, under the homelessness FAQs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16993)|
| 4:43:17| it states that the city provides outreach workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16997)|
| 4:43:21| coordinators, each time there's a clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17001)|
| 4:43:23| of an encampment to connect individuals with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17003)|
| 4:43:28| That hasn't been happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17008)|
| 4:43:30| So I can kind of speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17010)|
| 4:43:34| One of the things that we're trying to work out right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17014)|
| 4:43:38| is this process that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17018)|
| 4:43:42| And the feedback that we're getting from outreach teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17022)|
| 4:43:45| and I fully support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17025)|
| 4:43:47| is that if outreach teams are consistently there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17027)|
| 4:43:52| when a cleaning occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17032)|
| 4:43:54| it can start to harm the rapport that they're building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17034)|
| 4:43:56| with the homeless teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17036)|
| 4:43:58| And so one of the ways that we're looking at trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17038)|
| 4:44:00| to maybe adapt this is getting outreach teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17040)|
| 4:44:04| to the camps that have been given notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17044)|
| 4:44:06| before the actual cleaning occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17046)|
| 4:44:08| to try and make that connection to permanent housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17048)|
| 4:44:12| so that it is still occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17052)|
| 4:44:15| But we're also still trying to hear the feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17055)|
| 4:44:19| that outreach teams are giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17059)|
| 4:44:21| and make sure that they can maintain that rapport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17061)|
| 4:44:24| that they've built on the street with these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17064)|
| 4:44:26| Because when cleanings occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17066)|
| 4:44:28| folks go into crisis and it can be a challenging situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17068)|
| 4:44:34| And outreach, the feedback we've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17074)|
| 4:44:36| from outreach teams is that it can be a hard point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17076)|
| 4:44:39| of engagement to really help guide them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17079)|
| 4:44:42| in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17082)|
| 4:44:43| So it's really getting on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17083)|
| 4:44:45| we're trying to work out that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17085)|
| 4:44:47| in the best way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17087)|
| 4:44:49| So does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17089)|
| 4:44:52| Yeah, that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17092)|
| 4:44:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17095)|
| 4:45:08| Number two is non-congregate shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17108)|
| 4:45:14| So we, the Office on Homelessness is looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17114)|
| 4:45:18| to find a new encampment strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17118)|
| 4:45:22| And so following kind of the street outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17122)|
| 4:45:25| coordination model where we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17125)|
| 4:45:27| to get as much social service interaction as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17127)|
| 4:45:31| But then once notice is given to folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17131)|
| 4:45:37| and if folks are still resistant to accessing resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17137)|
| 4:45:43| non-congregate shelter would be offered upon displacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17143)|
| 4:45:46| if they're still in the camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17146)|
| 4:45:48| And then the co-responder team would be the entry point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17148)|
| 4:45:51| to non-congregate shelter and then individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17151)|
| 4:45:55| on our coordinated entry system would be prioritized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17155)|
| 4:45:59| out of the non-congregate shelter setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17159)|
| 4:46:04| A couple of things about this non-congregate shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17164)|
| 4:46:08| a behavioral health agency is needed for operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17168)|
| 4:46:11| There's not one doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17171)|
| 4:46:14| Obviously it would be targeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17174)|
| 4:46:15| our unsheltered homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17175)|
| 4:46:17| who have a lot of different behavioral health needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17177)|
| 4:46:23| both mental health and addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17183)|
| 4:46:25| And as well, these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17185)|
| 4:46:28| have physical health needs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17188)|
| 4:46:31| Number two, there is the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17191)|
| 4:46:35| for 100% FEMA reimbursement during the pandemic right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17195)|
| 4:46:40| One, it is time sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17200)|
| 4:46:42| And two, there's no actual guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17202)|
| 4:46:44| that we can access this funding from FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17204)|
| 4:46:48| Becky Wade and I have been in conversation with FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17208)|
| 4:46:52| and there are a myriad of different requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17212)|
| 4:46:59| that we have to fill to actually be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17219)|
| 4:47:01| to get this 100% reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17221)|
| 4:47:04| And one of them is essentially data supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17224)|
| 4:47:08| that we can justify the need for this shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17228)|
| 4:47:14| this type of sheltering for unsheltered homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17234)|
| 4:47:18| And so those are things that we are trying to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17238)|
| 4:47:22| But really what the Office on Homelessness is trying to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17242)|
| 4:47:26| is that we don't really necessarily just recommend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17246)|
| 4:47:30| as a strategy during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17250)|
| 4:47:33| We would like to see this happen beyond the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17253)|
| 4:47:36| and providing a new pathway to a stable setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17256)|
| 4:47:41| to try and work with some of our most challenging homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17261)|
| 4:47:45| and our unsheltered homeless in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17265)|
| 4:47:47| and see if we can have some efficacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17267)|
| 4:47:50| towards getting these people into permanent housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17270)|
| 4:47:53| or into residential treatment for substance abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17273)|
| 4:47:57| or any of these myriad of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17277)|
| 4:47:59| And then lastly, again, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17279)|
| 4:48:02| the Office on Homelessness does not recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17282)|
| 4:48:04| non-congregate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17284)|
| 4:48:05| without a strong social service presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17285)|
| 4:48:09| And so what council needs to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17289)|
| 4:48:12| is that this type of program and any shelter program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17292)|
| 4:48:16| it has a fiscal cost and we need to take that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17296)|
| 4:48:23| A couple of models too that have been prominent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17303)|
| 4:48:26| throughout the pandemic specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17306)|
| 4:48:29| there's Project Roomkey in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17309)|
| 4:48:33| There's the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17313)|
| 4:48:36| They also did a statewide non-congregate sheltering program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17316)|
| 4:48:41| Then the Coalition for the Homeless in Houston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17321)|
| 4:48:44| I'm gonna touch on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17324)|
| 4:48:46| because this is really where this model is based off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17326)|
| 4:48:50| with targeting small encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17330)|
| 4:48:55| and then moving these folks if they have barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17335)|
| 4:48:57| into housing into non-congregate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17337)|
| 4:48:59| and prioritizing them once they're in this setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17339)|
| 4:49:03| to try and get them into permanent housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17343)|
| 4:49:05| as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17345)|
| 4:49:07| And then lastly, Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17347)|
| 4:49:09| Chattanooga has been operating a non-congregate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17349)|
| 4:49:12| for medically vulnerable individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17352)|
| 4:49:15| They're also looking at expanding this model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17355)|
| 4:49:18| to their unsheltered homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17358)|
| 4:49:22| But per our meeting with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17362)|
| 4:49:25| it's unclear if it would continue beyond the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17365)|
| 4:49:30| Any questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17370)|
| 4:49:33| So Sean, really quickly, is the foyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17373)|
| 4:49:37| we've referred to that as non-congregate shelter as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17377)|
| 4:49:40| or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17380)|
| 4:49:41| No, the foyer is a congregate setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17381)|
| 4:49:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17385)|
| 4:49:47| This would be along the lines of what you may see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17387)|
| 4:49:54| The guest house is non-congregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17394)|
| 4:49:56| Okay, thank you, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17396)|
| 4:49:58| It's been a long night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17398)|
| 4:49:59| This would be more along the lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17399)|
| 4:50:02| of what CAC is likely doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17402)|
| 4:50:04| because it would need to be kind of an extended stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17404)|
| 4:50:07| hotel setting that has wraparound case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17407)|
| 4:50:12| and mental health services connected to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17412)|
| 4:50:15| along with security to maintain the setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17415)|
| 4:50:27| All right, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17427)|
| 4:50:32| Priority number three is a robust rapid rehousing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17432)|
| 4:50:37| Like we have talked about a lot tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17437)|
| 4:50:41| we need to improve our rapid rehousing system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17441)|
| 4:50:46| and really push a lot of funding towards this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17446)|
| 4:50:49| We need to alter it altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17449)|
| 4:50:52| We need to route all intakes through CHAMP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17452)|
| 4:50:54| our coordinated entry system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17454)|
| 4:50:56| And then coordinated entry will make the referral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17456)|
| 4:50:59| to housing navigation with Drew at House Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17459)|
| 4:51:04| And then what we need to do is with RH funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17464)|
| 4:51:07| that are pushed toward this arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17467)|
| 4:51:08| we need to leverage them to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17468)|
| 4:51:10| the private market housing inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17470)|
| 4:51:13| And that's done in a couple of different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17473)|
| 4:51:16| through landlord incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17476)|
| 4:51:18| again, through the risk mitigation fund that Drew spoke to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17478)|
| 4:51:24| but also by providing direct rental assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17484)|
| 4:51:27| to these folks and giving landlords security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17487)|
| 4:51:29| that there is going to be funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17489)|
| 4:51:33| to support their rent for X amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17493)|
| 4:51:36| And what we're looking at now is short term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17496)|
| 4:51:40| to medium term assistance, depending on the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17500)|
| 4:51:43| which would be anywhere from three to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17503)|
| 4:51:48| And then the next piece that this would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17508)|
| 4:51:50| is it would increase housing choice voucher participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17510)|
| 4:51:52| if we can bring more of those landlords into the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17512)|
| 4:51:56| Because one of the things that we're trying to do again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17516)|
| 4:51:58| is attach a housing choice voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17518)|
| 4:52:01| to the unit that individuals live in as a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17521)|
| 4:52:04| So that once the rapid rehousing funds are over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17524)|
| 4:52:07| that the housing choice voucher will then pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17527)|
| 4:52:10| and maintain the housing stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17530)|
| 4:52:12| of all the individuals that go through the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17532)|
| 4:52:16| And then the key piece that is needed for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17536)|
| 4:52:18| is post housing case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17538)|
| 4:52:20| And this has been a specific request made by landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17540)|
| 4:52:23| that they wanna make sure that there's somebody there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17543)|
| 4:52:26| walking with these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17546)|
| 4:52:28| helping them maintain their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17548)|
| 4:52:31| And the post housing case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17551)|
| 4:52:33| would likely also kind of act as a liaison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17553)|
| 4:52:37| just as Drew would for the landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17557)|
| 4:52:40| to provide them more security and give them a phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17560)|
| 4:52:43| a person they can call that's gonna pick up the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17563)|
| 4:52:46| and be able to answer whatever issues they're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17566)|
| 4:52:49| and come to the facility or to the house or the apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17569)|
| 4:52:55| to make sure that they can help resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17575)|
| 4:52:57| and mediate any issues that are happening with the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17577)|
| 4:53:01| So sustainability and system improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17581)|
| 4:53:05| Currently the funding plan is totally ESG-CV funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17585)|
| 4:53:10| And as we saw earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17590)|
| 4:53:13| we have a large amount of those funds right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17593)|
| 4:53:16| but we're not going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17596)|
| 4:53:18| having those funds moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17598)|
| 4:53:20| And so we need funding beyond the pandemic for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17600)|
| 4:53:26| And it will be crucial for it to really stay afloat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17606)|
| 4:53:30| and maintain and be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17610)|
| 4:53:34| A second piece would be to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17614)|
| 4:53:36| using the Affordable Rental Development Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17616)|
| 4:53:41| and the Affordable Housing Trust Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17621)|
| 4:53:43| and allocate units that are developed with those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17623)|
| 4:53:46| directly to the coordinated entry system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17626)|
| 4:53:51| And what that would look like is making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17631)|
| 4:53:53| that of X number of units that are developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17633)|
| 4:53:56| with these funds, a proportion of those units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17636)|
| 4:53:58| are gonna be available solely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17638)|
| 4:54:00| for the coordinated entry systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17640)|
| 4:54:02| so that we can move folks into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17642)|
| 4:54:04| and increase our housing inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17644)|
| 4:54:06| And then the other piece would be to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17646)|
| 4:54:09| proportional access to project-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17649)|
| 4:54:11| and housing choice vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17651)|
| 4:54:13| through the homeless preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17653)|
| 4:54:15| And so making sure that any of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17655)|
| 4:54:18| affordable housing developments that are created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17658)|
| 4:54:21| if they have project-based vouchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17661)|
| 4:54:24| making sure that a proportion of those units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17664)|
| 4:54:26| are again allocated directly to coordinated entry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17666)|
| 4:54:32| as well as making sure that we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17672)|
| 4:54:34| housing choice vouchers that can be accessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17674)|
| 4:54:37| through this coordinated entry system and process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17677)|
| 4:54:41| so that we can link rapid rehousing funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17681)|
| 4:54:44| to HDB vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17684)|
| 4:54:49| Any questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17689)|
| 4:54:55| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17695)|
| 4:54:57| We'll let Mike take over for these next three priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17697)|
| 4:55:02| So this one should look pretty familiar to you by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17702)|
| 4:55:07| We need to increase permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17707)|
| 4:55:10| in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17710)|
| 4:55:12| It's particularly type of housing that's gonna serve folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17712)|
| 4:55:16| who are, that you see out in encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17716)|
| 4:55:19| and have higher need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17719)|
| 4:55:22| The permanent supportive housing that we have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17722)|
| 4:55:25| as it was reported, at capacity or nearly at capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17725)|
| 4:55:30| And that's good because that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17730)|
| 4:55:32| there's not a lot of turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17732)|
| 4:55:36| We've done some modeling and have an estimated number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17736)|
| 4:55:41| of 541 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17741)|
| 4:55:44| This is a number that we're still working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17744)|
| 4:55:46| and may be refined, but that's kind of the ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17746)|
| 4:55:49| that we're thinking at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17749)|
| 4:55:51| that is needed to meet the need for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17751)|
| 4:55:56| We've talked about this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17756)|
| 4:55:58| We need permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17758)|
| 4:56:01| throughout our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17761)|
| 4:56:03| and we really need political will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17763)|
| 4:56:05| We need your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17765)|
| 4:56:08| Part of the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17768)|
| 4:56:09| there was a question about the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17769)|
| 4:56:11| for developing supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17771)|
| 4:56:14| and a significant part of the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17774)|
| 4:56:16| in that has been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17776)|
| 4:56:19| But Chris Martin was talking about where we find a place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17779)|
| 4:56:24| there's objections to that place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17784)|
| 4:56:29| often couched in language that it's a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17789)|
| 4:56:33| but for some reason, the spot that you've chosen is good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17793)|
| 4:56:35| so you need to pick somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17795)|
| 4:56:37| And at some point, we have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17797)|
| 4:56:40| this is a need in our community, we're gonna do it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17800)|
| 4:56:42| but we need to be able to make it happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17802)|
| 4:56:47| without having long protracted public fights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17807)|
| 4:56:50| just to get locations identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17810)|
| 4:56:55| In addition to agencies like KLF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17815)|
| 4:57:00| Chris Martin says they're ready to go to do some more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17820)|
| 4:57:03| which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17823)|
| 4:57:04| We've been looking to see if there are others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17824)|
| 4:57:06| that we can bring to bear that have experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17826)|
| 4:57:10| and we'll find whatever resources we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17830)|
| 4:57:16| whatever implementers we can to get more developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17836)|
| 4:57:19| if we can get the resources in place to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17839)|
| 4:57:22| The American Rescue Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17842)|
| 4:57:24| this is the bill that was just passed in Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17844)|
| 4:57:28| has, I think, my understanding is about 5 billion year mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17848)|
| 4:57:34| for things like supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17854)|
| 4:57:36| that could go to supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17856)|
| 4:57:38| Some of that should come to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17858)|
| 4:57:40| through the HOME Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17860)|
| 4:57:41| which is managed by the Neighborhoods Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17861)|
| 4:57:46| And so we would look to that as one piece of the puzzle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17866)|
| 4:57:49| in addition to the Affordable Rental Development Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17869)|
| 4:57:55| and the Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17875)|
| 4:57:57| One other thing that we've looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17877)|
| 4:58:00| something that was mentioned a moment ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17880)|
| 4:58:02| with the non-congregate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17882)|
| 4:58:05| was Project Room Key in California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17885)|
| 4:58:08| which is use of non-congregate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17888)|
| 4:58:11| to help people move off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17891)|
| 4:58:12| Well, that's being doubled over into Project Home Key,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17892)|
| 4:58:16| where they're working within many of those cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17896)|
| 4:58:20| to convert those hotels and motels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17900)|
| 4:58:24| from non-congregate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17904)|
| 4:58:26| into permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17906)|
| 4:58:27| so that we don't just get people off the street temporarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17907)|
| 4:58:31| but get them a permanent place to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17911)|
| 4:58:33| that's well-managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17913)|
| 4:58:39| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17919)|
| 4:58:44| We'll jump to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17924)|
| 4:58:47| This you heard about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17927)|
| 4:58:49| We need behavioral health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17929)|
| 4:58:52| increase of medical detox, monitored detox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17932)|
| 4:58:55| and other addiction stabilization and treatment services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17935)|
| 4:58:59| We need to prioritize unsheltered homeless access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17939)|
| 4:59:02| to these types of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17942)|
| 4:59:06| It was already mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17946)|
| 4:59:08| I think Mr. Rosen mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17948)|
| 4:59:09| that when somebody's ready for treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17949)|
| 4:59:11| we need to get people into treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17951)|
| 4:59:15| Giving somebody a date to go at some later point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17955)|
| 4:59:19| is not terribly effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17959)|
| 4:59:22| when somebody has that kind of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17962)|
| 4:59:25| We need to find ways to provide behavioral health treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17965)|
| 4:59:30| beyond short-term stabilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17970)|
| 4:59:32| and help people move into housing after treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17972)|
| 4:59:38| All these pieces of the puzzle have to go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17978)|
| 4:59:41| Behavioral health is often not traditionally funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17981)|
| 4:59:46| in a huge way at the local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17986)|
| 4:59:47| which means we also need to be advocating backup bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17987)|
| 4:59:51| to the state level and the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17991)|
| 4:59:54| It was mentioned the closure of Lake Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17994)|
| 4:59:56| Well, that has had a big impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=17996)|
| 5:00:00| We need everybody up the line realizing that this is a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18000)|
| 5:00:05| It's not just in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18005)|
| 5:00:07| It's statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18007)|
| 5:00:08| It's nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18008)|
| 5:00:09| So we need to do everything we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18009)|
| 5:00:11| to do what we can locally here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18011)|
| 5:00:13| but we also need to advocate backup upstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18013)|
| 5:00:16| to get resources for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18016)|
| 5:00:19| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18019)|
| 5:00:20| I guess I'm just gonna jump in in the essence of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18020)|
| 5:00:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18025)|
| 5:00:26| So what are the ways for us to increase medical detox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18026)|
| 5:00:32| Is that something that's within the reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18032)|
| 5:00:34| of city government or is that all kind of contingent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18034)|
| 5:00:39| on legislation and governments upstream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18039)|
| 5:00:44| A lot of the behavioral health funding resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18044)|
| 5:00:49| are gonna be dependent often in help from upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18049)|
| 5:00:55| There are things that we can look at to do locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18055)|
| 5:00:57| but those have been traditionally for public funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18057)|
| 5:01:01| been had come from the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18061)|
| 5:01:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18064)|
| 5:01:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18065)|
| 5:01:05| I know, Mike, you and I have talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18065)|
| 5:01:06| about this at different times, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18066)|
| 5:01:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18068)|
| 5:01:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18069)|
| 5:01:11| For those of you still watching at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18071)|
| 5:01:12| I think that's a good reason to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18072)|
| 5:01:14| your representative, state representative or senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18074)|
| 5:01:20| And then finally, we've talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18080)|
| 5:01:22| a little bit already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18082)|
| 5:01:23| but we are enthusiastic about looking for ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18083)|
| 5:01:27| to increase our collaboration with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18087)|
| 5:01:32| They're certainly stepping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18092)|
| 5:01:33| We're looking for ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18093)|
| 5:01:35| We're looking for ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18095)|
| 5:01:37| We're looking for other ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18097)|
| 5:01:40| So we're looking at a collaboration with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18100)|
| 5:01:42| They're certainly stepping up in a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18102)|
| 5:01:45| They are funding the outreach worker at CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18105)|
| 5:01:48| that was mentioned for serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18108)|
| 5:01:49| doing some of the work at the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18109)|
| 5:01:51| county boundaries and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18111)|
| 5:01:54| They're doing the treasury department homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18114)|
| 5:01:58| prevention, utility and rent assistance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18118)|
| 5:02:02| So that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18122)|
| 5:02:04| And we're looking for other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18124)|
| 5:02:05| to see if we can collaborate with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18125)|
| 5:02:07| on permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18127)|
| 5:02:09| or anything that we can bring to bear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18129)|
| 5:02:11| in cooperation with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18131)|
| 5:02:13| Because as was mentioned at the top of all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18133)|
| 5:02:16| the city is in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18136)|
| 5:02:18| and every city citizen is a county citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18138)|
| 5:02:21| So we wanna find every way we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18141)|
| 5:02:25| to collaborate and cooperate with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18145)|
| 5:02:32| I'm gonna jump in since there's limited time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18152)|
| 5:02:34| I just have to emphasize again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18154)|
| 5:02:36| if we are framing our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18156)|
| 5:02:39| and the importance of our work in terms of complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18159)|
| 5:02:43| that is how we're gonna design the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18163)|
| 5:02:48| If we're not leading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18168)|
| 5:02:50| if we're not increasing city and county collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18170)|
| 5:02:53| because we have an increasing population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18173)|
| 5:02:56| of homeless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18176)|
| 5:02:58| and we as two governments must work together to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18178)|
| 5:03:02| And it's not because we have a surge of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18182)|
| 5:03:06| No, it's gonna impact how we approach the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18186)|
| 5:03:10| That's all I wanted to emphasize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18190)|
| 5:03:13| Yeah, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18193)|
| 5:03:14| I don't think certainly the way I look at the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18194)|
| 5:03:17| that we do is just complaint driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18197)|
| 5:03:20| Certainly we get a lot from both directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18200)|
| 5:03:23| or all directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18203)|
| 5:03:24| but the folks that you've heard from this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18204)|
| 5:03:29| are here because we're trying to help people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18209)|
| 5:03:32| who find themselves in need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18212)|
| 5:03:35| And we're trying to build a better system continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18215)|
| 5:03:37| to serve them and to serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18217)|
| 5:03:48| Yes, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18228)|
| 5:03:55| I think you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18235)|
| 5:03:58| Sorry, I'll follow up on a couple items after this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18238)|
| 5:04:02| but I just wanted to get perspective again after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18242)|
| 5:04:06| around disbursement in terms of dispersed housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18246)|
| 5:04:11| affordable housing, as opposed to concentrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18251)|
| 5:04:15| That's a longer discussion, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18255)|
| 5:04:18| but there's a lot of experts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18258)|
| 5:04:19| So I'd like to somehow follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18259)|
| 5:04:25| The other one we didn't talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18265)|
| 5:04:27| was employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18267)|
| 5:04:29| So as it relates to housing related programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18269)|
| 5:04:35| how does employment make its way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18275)|
| 5:04:39| employment assistance, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18279)|
| 5:04:41| I know certain programs have that, others don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18281)|
| 5:04:45| but we didn't talk much about that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18285)|
| 5:04:47| So again, don't need to explain answers to those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18287)|
| 5:04:51| but I'd be interested in following up on those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18291)|
| 5:04:55| Sure, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18295)|
| 5:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18296)|
| 5:05:00| And I will just address the complaint topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18300)|
| 5:05:07| That's really not where these priorities were derived from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18307)|
| 5:05:13| It is something that the city has to manage and respond to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18313)|
| 5:05:18| but a lot of these pieces of developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18318)|
| 5:05:20| a more robust rapid rehousing system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18320)|
| 5:05:23| and making sure that we can increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18323)|
| 5:05:26| the presence of street outreach workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18326)|
| 5:05:28| to as much of the city as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18328)|
| 5:05:31| and making sure that we're making connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18331)|
| 5:05:34| across the board, those things aren't driven by complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18334)|
| 5:05:39| but they're driven to try and connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18339)|
| 5:05:41| more homeless individuals to permanent housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18341)|
| 5:05:46| and make sure that we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18346)|
| 5:05:47| as many of those folks connected as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18347)|
| 5:05:50| And again, the development of permanent housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18350)|
| 5:05:53| or the development of more medical detox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18353)|
| 5:05:57| and behavioral health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18357)|
| 5:05:59| that's again, that's feedback directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18359)|
| 5:06:01| from our outreach teams as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18361)|
| 5:06:03| They're going out to camps and they have folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18363)|
| 5:06:07| that are asking for treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18367)|
| 5:06:09| and they don't have a pathway to give that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18369)|
| 5:06:15| And so I really wanna reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18375)|
| 5:06:17| that the priorities that we're developing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18377)|
| 5:06:19| and that we wanna follow are about moving folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18379)|
| 5:06:24| into housing and getting folks connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18384)|
| 5:06:27| to our coordinated entry system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18387)|
| 5:06:28| and making sure that we're pushing the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18388)|
| 5:06:30| to the right places to get these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18390)|
| 5:06:33| where they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18393)|
| 5:06:40| I just wanna tack onto that to also clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18400)|
| 5:06:43| it's not all complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18403)|
| 5:06:45| A lot of the calls that I get are, how do I help people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18405)|
| 5:06:50| People really wanna know how to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18410)|
| 5:06:52| and they can't figure out how to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18412)|
| 5:06:55| And they wanna send help to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18415)|
| 5:06:58| when they see them camping or without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18418)|
| 5:07:03| And that's a struggle for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18423)|
| 5:07:05| because we want to make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18425)|
| 5:07:16| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18436)|
| 5:07:18| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18438)|
| 5:07:19| Last questions for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18439)|
| 5:07:21| I know we're running late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18441)|
| 5:07:25| Yes, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18445)|
| 5:07:28| So I feel like this workshop came about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18448)|
| 5:07:33| because we've had a lot of concerns in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18453)|
| 5:07:38| because of the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18458)|
| 5:07:41| with how our homeless population is being treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18461)|
| 5:07:46| By the city of Knoxville during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18466)|
| 5:07:49| And I really appreciate the five and a half hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18469)|
| 5:07:55| of information that was shared tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18475)|
| 5:07:58| Much of it, I hope my fellow council members already know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18478)|
| 5:08:03| I spent time with many of you when I was elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18483)|
| 5:08:07| and sat down and we spent hours talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18487)|
| 5:08:09| about the different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18489)|
| 5:08:12| So this was quite repetitive for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18492)|
| 5:08:14| but I appreciate the refresher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18494)|
| 5:08:15| because there was some new information of new activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18495)|
| 5:08:20| that have been discussed at least since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18500)|
| 5:08:25| But what I see missing is how do we stop the encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18505)|
| 5:08:30| from being cleared when there's nowhere for them to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18510)|
| 5:08:35| That's the question that people want answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18515)|
| 5:08:38| Where do people go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18518)|
| 5:08:40| And why are you clearing encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18520)|
| 5:08:41| when there's no place for people to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18521)|
| 5:08:44| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18524)|
| 5:08:45| That's the only question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18525)|
| 5:08:54| Councilman Parker, I appreciate your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18534)|
| 5:08:57| And I think that what we have tried to explain this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18537)|
| 5:09:04| is the complexity of the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18544)|
| 5:09:06| that you are trying to have answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18546)|
| 5:09:09| That we have a whole system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18549)|
| 5:09:12| that is working to address the issue of homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18552)|
| 5:09:17| and we have shelter capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18557)|
| 5:09:20| There are still people living on the streets who need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18560)|
| 5:09:24| We have a system of services to get them in that pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18564)|
| 5:09:28| to get them to a place of shelter and permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18568)|
| 5:09:32| There are gaps in the system that we've identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18572)|
| 5:09:36| And I think the question that you're trying to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18576)|
| 5:09:39| is one that we are working on every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18579)|
| 5:09:46| This morning, a camp was cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18586)|
| 5:09:49| with a bulldozer in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18589)|
| 5:09:51| a place where people were sleeping hours before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18591)|
| 5:09:56| A bulldozer was brought in to clear that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18596)|
| 5:10:00| I mean, I do international human rights work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18600)|
| 5:10:02| I've traveled all around the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18602)|
| 5:10:04| done work with folks who have lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18604)|
| 5:10:07| for generations in encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18607)|
| 5:10:09| And the human rights issue in that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18609)|
| 5:10:13| is folks are not investing enough money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18613)|
| 5:10:15| so that we don't have generations growing up in encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18615)|
| 5:10:20| Sadly, the city of Knoxville is patting itself on the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18620)|
| 5:10:25| by preventing an encampment to even hold space for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18625)|
| 5:10:31| for fear that folks will get too comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18631)|
| 5:10:33| I don't know, folks will pollute the rivers too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18633)|
| 5:10:36| All of these are issues that we have the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18636)|
| 5:10:39| to manage, to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18639)|
| 5:10:42| We can put out more port-a-potties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18642)|
| 5:10:44| We can divide up encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18644)|
| 5:10:47| We can designate areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18647)|
| 5:10:50| But moving folks, chasing folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18650)|
| 5:10:52| throughout the city with bulldozers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18652)|
| 5:10:54| makes absolute no sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18654)|
| 5:10:57| That's what I want an explanation for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18657)|
| 5:10:58| How does that fit into this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18658)|
| 5:11:01| How does that make any sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18661)|
| 5:11:02| How does it help anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18662)|
| 5:11:05| So I feel really certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18665)|
| 5:11:07| that I'm not gonna be able to satisfy your concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18667)|
| 5:11:11| this evening, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18671)|
| 5:11:12| I do just wanna clarify for council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18672)|
| 5:11:15| and for those who are listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18675)|
| 5:11:17| that we have encampments that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18677)|
| 5:11:20| former encampments that have been posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18680)|
| 5:11:23| They're somewhere on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18683)|
| 5:11:26| somewhere in areas there has been danger identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18686)|
| 5:11:29| Those have been posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18689)|
| 5:11:31| We go through those encampments every single week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18691)|
| 5:11:35| The former encampments every single week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18695)|
| 5:11:37| This morning, there was a cleaning that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18697)|
| 5:11:40| There was nobody present in the tent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18700)|
| 5:11:43| that you're talking about, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18703)|
| 5:11:46| I just wanna make sure that everyone knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18706)|
| 5:11:48| we clean those sites every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18708)|
| 5:11:50| And they're posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18710)|
| 5:11:53| The people who are, we have outreach workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18713)|
| 5:11:58| who are reaching out to folks in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18718)|
| 5:12:01| I know that that's not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18721)|
| 5:12:02| that is gonna be satisfactory to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18722)|
| 5:12:04| but that just is the reality of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18724)|
| 5:12:08| We just had a four and a half hour conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18728)|
| 5:12:11| that proved everything you just said wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18731)|
| 5:12:15| So we've established that outreach workers are not there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18735)|
| 5:12:20| when the camps are cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18740)|
| 5:12:22| We have, I mean, we've established a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18742)|
| 5:12:26| that don't happen that the city says are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18746)|
| 5:12:30| Unnecessarily, this doesn't connect folks with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18750)|
| 5:12:34| So my question is, what good does it do our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18754)|
| 5:12:40| to waste the money to clear encampments on a weekly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18760)|
| 5:12:44| when we could be putting folks into hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18764)|
| 5:12:47| using the FEMA funding, not everybody out on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18767)|
| 5:12:51| I've been out on the streets talking to folks too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18771)|
| 5:12:53| I've met plenty of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18773)|
| 5:12:55| who will be ready to go into a hotel tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18775)|
| 5:12:58| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18778)|
| 5:12:59| It's the service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18779)|
| 5:13:02| home with them and putting them into a bed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18782)|
| 5:13:06| taking them home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18786)|
| 5:13:07| If they can take them home with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18787)|
| 5:13:09| you can put them into a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18789)|
| 5:13:11| So I don't understand the circles that we're speaking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18791)|
| 5:13:14| You sound good, but you're not following through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18794)|
| 5:13:17| on what you say you're trying to do in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18797)|
| 5:13:20| It doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18800)|
| 5:13:22| Please explain to me why we cannot stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18802)|
| 5:13:25| the clearing of encampments until the pandemic ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18805)|
| 5:13:30| as the CDC has recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18810)|
| 5:13:33| and we get a plan in place to put them into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18813)|
| 5:13:36| Why is that not an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18816)|
| 5:13:42| Again, Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18822)|
| 5:13:43| I am not gonna be able to answer this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18823)|
| 5:13:46| to your satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18826)|
| 5:13:47| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18827)|
| 5:13:49| I think we've just spent four hours going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18829)|
| 5:13:53| everything from some of the danger situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18833)|
| 5:13:57| and encampments, our process to reaching out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18837)|
| 5:14:00| to encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18840)|
| 5:14:01| I just explained that when we clear encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18841)|
| 5:14:06| they're posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18846)|
| 5:14:08| If people come back into the encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18848)|
| 5:14:10| there's a notification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18850)|
| 5:14:12| There is outreach that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18852)|
| 5:14:15| So I realize I'm not gonna answer this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18855)|
| 5:14:19| to your satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18859)|
| 5:14:20| I'm happy to continue to have the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18860)|
| 5:14:23| This is an issue that we're struggling with as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18863)|
| 5:14:26| We've identified this is an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18866)|
| 5:14:28| that we're struggling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18868)|
| 5:14:30| We're not the only city that's struggling with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18870)|
| 5:14:32| We don't have all the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18872)|
| 5:14:34| We are continuing to improve the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18874)|
| 5:14:36| that we address homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18876)|
| 5:14:38| realizing that there are areas and gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18878)|
| 5:14:41| that we identified during this meeting tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18881)|
| 5:14:44| that we're continuing to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18884)|
| 5:14:46| And I'm not sure what else after four and a half hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18886)|
| 5:14:52| we can provide to you to satisfy the question that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18892)|
| 5:14:57| I don't know if any other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18897)|
| 5:15:00| or staff from the Office on Homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18900)|
| 5:15:03| would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18903)|
| 5:15:07| I would like to say that two pieces of the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18907)|
| 5:15:11| that we presented tonight are directly targeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18911)|
| 5:15:17| what you're getting at Councilwoman Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18917)|
| 5:15:19| and the development of non-congregate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18919)|
| 5:15:23| and giving people another pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18923)|
| 5:15:26| is something that we're looking to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18926)|
| 5:15:29| and hope to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18929)|
| 5:15:31| And then two, as a direct feedback from outreach teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18931)|
| 5:15:37| that has played into a key role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18937)|
| 5:15:39| why we would like to expand the co-responder model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18939)|
| 5:15:42| to make sure that individuals during these times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18942)|
| 5:15:46| that there is always constantly going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18946)|
| 5:15:49| that social service presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18949)|
| 5:15:51| So these are actively things that we are getting at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18951)|
| 5:15:55| and working at and trying to get implemented right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18955)|
| 5:16:04| Are there other questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18964)|
| 5:16:06| I know we have public speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18966)|
| 5:16:07| that have been waiting to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18967)|
| 5:16:16| I'm gonna ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18976)|
| 5:16:19| So you guys talked about in the priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18979)|
| 5:16:24| not in particular order one through six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18984)|
| 5:16:28| non-congregate shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18988)|
| 5:16:29| needing a partner agency for operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18989)|
| 5:16:32| and using the FEMA funds and a way to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=18992)|
| 5:16:40| What's the feasibility and the reality of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19000)|
| 5:16:44| Is that, how realistic is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19004)|
| 5:16:50| That was identified as priority number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19010)|
| 5:16:55| I know Becky Wade has been on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19015)|
| 5:16:58| with TEMA and FEMA to discuss this, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19018)|
| 5:17:03| And yes, it is an option for FEMA, TEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19023)|
| 5:17:10| to reimburse the city for non-congregate shelter expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19030)|
| 5:17:15| There's certain things that they cannot reimburse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19035)|
| 5:17:18| They cannot reimburse case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19038)|
| 5:17:21| or mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19041)|
| 5:17:22| So that's a piece that the city would need to plan to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19042)|
| 5:17:28| They can pay for room costs, food, security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19048)|
| 5:17:33| things like that to house someone in a motel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19053)|
| 5:17:36| hotel, non-congregate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19056)|
| 5:17:41| They can't guarantee that they can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19061)|
| 5:17:43| those funds to us though until we submit an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19063)|
| 5:17:48| and there are some bars that we have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19068)|
| 5:17:53| We have to prove that this is warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19073)|
| 5:17:56| for the reduction of COVID spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19076)|
| 5:18:02| and backed up by data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19082)|
| 5:18:04| So, whether we're able to do that or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19084)|
| 5:18:09| We're still pursuing this as an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19089)|
| 5:18:13| and we want to reach out to a provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19093)|
| 5:18:17| to see if they would be willing to manage the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19097)|
| 5:18:21| Right now, I'm not sure how that needs to be procured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19101)|
| 5:18:23| We may have to go through an RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19103)|
| 5:18:26| or they may let us do it as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19106)|
| 5:18:29| So these are all questions that are still up in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19109)|
| 5:18:32| We want to move forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19112)|
| 5:18:34| but it's an issue of either the city pays 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19114)|
| 5:18:39| of all this and doesn't get reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19119)|
| 5:18:42| and then continues it after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19122)|
| 5:18:45| or we get some reimbursement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19125)|
| 5:18:48| So, those are still questions in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19128)|
| 5:18:50| The other point is that FEMA will only reimburse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19130)|
| 5:18:53| until September 30th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19133)|
| 5:18:57| So, it's a short-term window and not guaranteed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19137)|
| 5:19:03| but we are pursuing this as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19143)|
| 5:19:08| I also want to remind the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19148)|
| 5:19:10| that the National Homelessness Law Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19150)|
| 5:19:13| has offered themselves as a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19153)|
| 5:19:15| They are the experts on this FEMA funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19155)|
| 5:19:18| and will help the city identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19158)|
| 5:19:20| what might be possible for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19160)|
| 5:19:25| I'm happy to see that we haven't used all our ESG funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19165)|
| 5:19:28| because that's what many other cities are using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19168)|
| 5:19:30| for the support services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19170)|
| 5:19:32| And I can even, I've looked into this a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19172)|
| 5:19:34| and I'll be happy to sit down with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19174)|
| 5:19:37| and share everything that I've learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19177)|
| 5:19:39| because time is limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19179)|
| 5:19:41| I've been pushing for this for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19181)|
| 5:19:43| We're running out of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19183)|
| 5:19:44| to bring this money into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19184)|
| 5:19:47| This is not only for Knoxville as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19187)|
| 5:19:50| but this is to help the most vulnerable people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19190)|
| 5:19:53| in our community recover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19193)|
| 5:19:57| not only from a pandemic, but a horrible recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19197)|
| 5:20:01| And once we bring in these resources to stabilize them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19201)|
| 5:20:05| so that we can access them for vaccines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19205)|
| 5:20:10| so that they can have an address to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19210)|
| 5:20:14| the stimulus money that's coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19214)|
| 5:20:17| the time that we lose makes it more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19217)|
| 5:20:21| for our most vulnerable community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19221)|
| 5:20:24| to recover from this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19224)|
| 5:20:27| And it's hard for cities to make this a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19227)|
| 5:20:30| because the people who are making these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19230)|
| 5:20:32| are comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19232)|
| 5:20:34| We've received our stimulus checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19234)|
| 5:20:36| and are happy to go spend them on whatever we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19236)|
| 5:20:41| But there are people who could actually be using that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19241)|
| 5:20:43| as a first month's rent or to get them out of a hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19243)|
| 5:20:48| This is not just about cleaning up homeless folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19248)|
| 5:20:51| from our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19251)|
| 5:20:52| This is about their recovery from this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19252)|
| 5:21:02| Ms. Wade, do we have a timeline for the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19262)|
| 5:21:08| and being able to set it up to utilize the funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19268)|
| 5:21:11| Well, there's a couple of steps we have to get in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19271)|
| 5:21:14| First of all, we have to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19274)|
| 5:21:16| how to procure a provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19276)|
| 5:21:18| If that has to go through an RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19278)|
| 5:21:23| that could take a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19283)|
| 5:21:26| We have to submit an application to TEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19286)|
| 5:21:29| to see if they'll approve the reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19289)|
| 5:21:32| And then they will only reimburse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19292)|
| 5:21:36| through the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19296)|
| 5:21:38| So I can't tell you exactly dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19298)|
| 5:21:42| that we'll have these things ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19302)|
| 5:21:44| but I would think within 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19304)|
| 5:21:47| we may be able to have some answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19307)|
| 5:21:50| on the FEMA reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19310)|
| 5:21:54| The organization that Council Member Parker mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19314)|
| 5:21:58| would they be an eligible organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19318)|
| 5:22:01| that could apply for the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19321)|
| 5:22:04| or have a conversation with you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19324)|
| 5:22:07| No, we'd need to have a local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19327)|
| 5:22:11| someone to provide case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19331)|
| 5:22:13| and behavioral health to manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19333)|
| 5:22:16| We need the case management piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19336)|
| 5:22:17| to go along with the non-congregate shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19337)|
| 5:22:20| because we need to make sure people are well taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19340)|
| 5:22:26| while they're in a motel room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19346)|
| 5:22:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19351)|
| 5:22:34| I think Council Member-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19354)|
| 5:22:34| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19354)|
| 5:22:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19358)|
| 5:22:39| Just a quick question about the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19359)|
| 5:22:41| Then I assume you would also have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19361)|
| 5:22:43| in the meantime, be looking for hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19363)|
| 5:22:45| that are willing to participate in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19365)|
| 5:22:48| Would you have to find a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19368)|
| 5:22:50| that you would lease a whole hotel or move people around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19370)|
| 5:22:54| So there's also the work that has to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19374)|
| 5:22:59| on finding hotel rooms that would lease for long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19379)|
| 5:23:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19385)|
| 5:23:06| So that'll be also something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19386)|
| 5:23:07| that you're working on at the same time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19387)|
| 5:23:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19390)|
| 5:23:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19391)|
| 5:23:15| Ms. Wade, another question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19395)|
| 5:23:16| you may or may not have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19396)|
| 5:23:18| As it relates to, let's say that there's contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19398)|
| 5:23:21| that are entered into with hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19401)|
| 5:23:25| that would do some long-term agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19405)|
| 5:23:27| what is the transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19407)|
| 5:23:30| Would, you know, do those funds allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19410)|
| 5:23:32| for transportation services to get people to the hotels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19412)|
| 5:23:36| How would that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19416)|
| 5:23:38| Do you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19418)|
| 5:23:39| I don't know the answer to that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19419)|
| 5:23:42| I would assume that has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19422)|
| 5:23:44| that could be covered under wraparound services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19424)|
| 5:23:48| but I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19428)|
| 5:23:51| I can find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19431)|
| 5:23:52| Okay, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19432)|
| 5:23:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19433)|
| 5:23:54| I think if it's deemed a medical service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19434)|
| 5:23:58| in some capacity, FEMA does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19438)|
| 5:24:02| but I'd have to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19442)|
| 5:24:02| into additional transportation services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19442)|
| 5:24:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19446)|
| 5:24:12| Sean, this is Misty Goodwin again with CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19452)|
| 5:24:14| I just wanna say one quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19454)|
| 5:24:16| With regard to the hotel placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19456)|
| 5:24:17| I will say that, you know, we've had success there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19457)|
| 5:24:20| but it has absolutely had everything to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19460)|
| 5:24:22| with the fact that we are providing case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19462)|
| 5:24:25| to each and every one of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19465)|
| 5:24:26| that we're providing service to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19466)|
| 5:24:28| and so, you know, we have had a few families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19468)|
| 5:24:32| who have not been able to stay in the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19472)|
| 5:24:34| because they, you know, there were some behavior issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19474)|
| 5:24:38| there were some uninvited guests that were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19478)|
| 5:24:40| there was drug use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19480)|
| 5:24:42| and so they ended up having to find somewhere else to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19482)|
| 5:24:45| because we couldn't ruin that relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19485)|
| 5:24:48| with the hotel that's agreed to partner with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19488)|
| 5:24:51| for the others that are there and doing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19491)|
| 5:24:55| what they need to be doing to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19495)|
| 5:24:57| So that is definitely a big piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19497)|
| 5:25:00| and I also just wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19500)|
| 5:25:03| most of the hotels that we've partnered with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19503)|
| 5:25:05| will not allow guests to stay beyond 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19505)|
| 5:25:08| and so you have to look more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19508)|
| 5:25:10| towards the longer-term hotels that will work with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19510)|
| 5:25:14| and they are a little more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19514)|
| 5:25:17| but that is another piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19517)|
| 5:25:18| We're moving families, you know, a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19518)|
| 5:25:21| just when they reach that 30-day mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19521)|
| 5:25:24| because the hotels are just not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19524)|
| 5:25:26| to let them stay there long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19526)|
| 5:25:29| Misty, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19529)|
| 5:25:30| In the experience that you've had with families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19530)|
| 5:25:33| or individuals that have stayed 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19533)|
| 5:25:35| what's the success rate in placement for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19535)|
| 5:25:38| after the, at that 30-day mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19538)|
| 5:25:42| Right now, well, it depends on two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19542)|
| 5:25:45| One, what size is the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19545)|
| 5:25:46| So the smaller families, if it's two or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19546)|
| 5:25:49| it is taking probably around 40, 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19549)|
| 5:25:54| To find housing, those larger families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19554)|
| 5:25:59| that are, you know, five and six people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19559)|
| 5:26:01| that takes much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19561)|
| 5:26:02| That's more, that's over a 60-day period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19562)|
| 5:26:05| and sometimes up to 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19565)|
| 5:26:07| probably more frequently than 90-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19567)|
| 5:26:10| So it really just depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19570)|
| 5:26:11| It also depends on credits, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19571)|
| 5:26:14| where we're trying to place someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19574)|
| 5:26:15| if they have been banned from KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19575)|
| 5:26:18| or one of the other public housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19578)|
| 5:26:20| So there's some different scenarios there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19580)|
| 5:26:22| but all in all, we've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19582)|
| 5:26:26| we've been pretty successful with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19586)|
| 5:26:28| Out of the 41, we've placed 25 households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19588)|
| 5:26:31| into permanent housing, and the others are still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19591)|
| 5:26:35| so we're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19595)|
| 5:26:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19597)|
| 5:26:39| I will say, though, that that's because it is families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19599)|
| 5:26:42| you've got families and seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19602)|
| 5:26:44| who are typically a little easier to place than singles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19604)|
| 5:26:48| just because of the lack of affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19608)|
| 5:26:49| for singles right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19609)|
| 5:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19613)|
| 5:26:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19614)|
| 5:26:57| Go ahead, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19617)|
| 5:26:58| Councilor, do we have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19618)|
| 5:27:02| Yeah, sorry, I was just gonna add that I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19622)|
| 5:27:06| thinking about the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19626)|
| 5:27:07| who would be moved from encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19627)|
| 5:27:08| another factor is that a lot of those folks don't have ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19628)|
| 5:27:14| and so then you're adding that other time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19634)|
| 5:27:16| of having to get birth certificate and ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19636)|
| 5:27:19| those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19639)|
| 5:27:20| to get them into permanent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19640)|
| 5:27:22| and so that's just a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19642)|
| 5:27:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19644)|
| 5:27:29| There are no additional questions or comments from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19649)|
| 5:27:32| I do wanna thank everyone for their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19652)|
| 5:27:34| in coming and presenting to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19654)|
| 5:27:36| This has been some really good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19656)|
| 5:27:39| We know that there are no easy solutions, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19659)|
| 5:27:45| but I am encouraged, especially hearing a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19665)|
| 5:27:48| about more collaborations with the county and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19668)|
| 5:27:52| which would add, hopefully, more resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19672)|
| 5:27:55| to what we're already doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19675)|
| 5:27:57| and just continuing to look at additional options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19677)|
| 5:28:00| and best practices, so I just wanted to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19680)|
| 5:28:04| At this time, we'll go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19684)|
| 5:28:05| and if you all are welcome to stay on the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19685)|
| 5:28:07| or if you need to drop, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19687)|
| 5:28:10| I know it's been a long day for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19690)|
| 5:28:11| and we certainly appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19691)|
| 5:28:13| We'll now get ready to start with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19693)|
| 5:28:16| Again, I just wanna reiterate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19696)|
| 5:28:18| for those who have signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19698)|
| 5:28:19| we appreciate your patience in staying on the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19699)|
| 5:28:23| and being able to talk to Council about this topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19703)|
| 5:28:27| or any topic that you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19707)|
| 5:28:28| We, again, ask that you would not use profanity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19708)|
| 5:28:31| or any personal attacks while you are addressing Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19711)|
| 5:28:36| In the event that you do, we will have you muted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19716)|
| 5:28:38| and go to the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19718)|
| 5:28:41| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19721)|
| 5:28:42| Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19722)|
| 5:28:44| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19724)|
| 5:28:45| Our first person is Brady Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19725)|
| 5:28:49| Mr. Watson, I've enabled you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19729)|
| 5:28:52| If you'd unmute and give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19732)|
| 5:28:55| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19735)|
| 5:28:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19738)|
| 5:28:59| Thank you, Mr. Johnson, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19739)|
| 5:29:02| Council members and the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19742)|
| 5:29:03| for a long and fruitful discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19743)|
| 5:29:07| This is, I think, a very important topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19747)|
| 5:29:09| and I know you all are concerned about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19749)|
| 5:29:11| so I appreciate you taking the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19751)|
| 5:29:12| and I think it's important for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19752)|
| 5:29:15| to have this discussion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19755)|
| 5:29:17| So I know you all had a long night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19757)|
| 5:29:20| so I'll try to be brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19760)|
| 5:29:20| but I've heard a lot of good things on this call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19760)|
| 5:29:23| I think it seems we're all in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19763)|
| 5:29:27| that Housing First is really where we need to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19767)|
| 5:29:30| and I think the special zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19770)|
| 5:29:33| that was passed last week on first reading is a good step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19773)|
| 5:29:38| I wanted to kind of just recap some of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19778)|
| 5:29:41| I noticed it sounds like we have some good goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19781)|
| 5:29:45| As a city, homelessness is not acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19785)|
| 5:29:47| for anyone in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19787)|
| 5:29:50| I know some things that were listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19790)|
| 5:29:51| were providing leadership, crisis response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19791)|
| 5:29:54| creating and maintaining access to decent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19794)|
| 5:29:57| appropriate, and affordable permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19797)|
| 5:29:59| I think that one's definitely key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19799)|
| 5:30:01| Economic opportunity and improving health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19801)|
| 5:30:03| and stability in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19803)|
| 5:30:06| There's also been some conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19806)|
| 5:30:08| about balancing homelessness with the broader community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19808)|
| 5:30:12| and I think at one point there was a quote of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19812)|
| 5:30:15| you know, being humane as we can be with the encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19815)|
| 5:30:20| And I know that there are certainly concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19820)|
| 5:30:22| about hygiene and health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19822)|
| 5:30:26| And then Officer Clinton mentioned several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19826)|
| 5:30:29| about some traumas that these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19829)|
| 5:30:31| have faced throughout their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19831)|
| 5:30:33| and some historical choices that may have led to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19833)|
| 5:30:36| being in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19836)|
| 5:30:38| And I agree with him that we need to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19838)|
| 5:30:40| in a compassionate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19840)|
| 5:30:43| You know, I think there are certainly concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19843)|
| 5:30:46| with theft and violence and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19846)|
| 5:30:50| And there probably are situations where these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19850)|
| 5:30:54| may be better off not so closely confined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19854)|
| 5:30:57| in encampments that have folks in unsafe conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19857)|
| 5:31:01| So I think it's certainly a balancing act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19861)|
| 5:31:05| but I know, I truly believe that we can do better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19865)|
| 5:31:08| and try to be more humane to these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19868)|
| 5:31:10| You know, I know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19870)|
| 5:31:12| I hope it's a last resort to sweep these camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19872)|
| 5:31:14| but I just, I guess I can't quite figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19874)|
| 5:31:19| in what situation it's okay to literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19879)|
| 5:31:23| you know, sweep these people's belongings and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19883)|
| 5:31:25| You know, and many folks sometimes lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19885)|
| 5:31:28| the only things they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19888)|
| 5:31:29| which might be very, very little to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19889)|
| 5:31:31| So I know that some of the folks in our group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19891)|
| 5:31:35| that are going and helping these folks move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19895)|
| 5:31:37| when these sweeps are initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19897)|
| 5:31:38| just spoke with some houses folks this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19898)|
| 5:31:42| They were along Cooper Street from Blackstock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19902)|
| 5:31:45| up towards Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19905)|
| 5:31:47| And one individual said that they were told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19907)|
| 5:31:49| they had 10 minutes to pack their things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19909)|
| 5:31:52| And when they mentioned they didn't have enough time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19912)|
| 5:31:54| they were told they only had two minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19914)|
| 5:31:55| and then they just lost everything they had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19915)|
| 5:31:57| including food they just bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19917)|
| 5:31:58| So I just ask that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19918)|
| 5:32:01| we try to have a little more empathy for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19921)|
| 5:32:03| and try to do what we can to avoid these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19923)|
| 5:32:06| You know, I know Lake Shore was brought up at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19926)|
| 5:32:09| I think we have a serious crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19929)|
| 5:32:11| with mental health in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19931)|
| 5:32:12| We don't have the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19932)|
| 5:32:13| We haven't invested in the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19933)|
| 5:32:15| to take care of these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19935)|
| 5:32:17| You know, the closest full, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19937)|
| 5:32:20| system mental health facilities in Moccasin Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19940)|
| 5:32:22| which is way down in Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19942)|
| 5:32:24| and that serves like 40 counties in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19944)|
| 5:32:27| So, you know, many folks can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19947)|
| 5:32:30| an unexpected $500 bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19950)|
| 5:32:33| Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19953)|
| 5:32:34| So it's really many folks are just one bill away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19954)|
| 5:32:37| from being homeless, you know, and I've been there myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19957)|
| 5:32:40| So I guess my point is that I would love to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19960)|
| 5:32:44| you know, let's try to be more compassionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19964)|
| 5:32:47| in these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19967)|
| 5:32:50| And just a couple of things to close up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19970)|
| 5:32:53| I think permanent supportive housing first is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19973)|
| 5:32:57| And it sounds like from the statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19977)|
| 5:33:00| that have been read tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19980)|
| 5:33:01| oftentimes that fills up quickly with the city does have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19981)|
| 5:33:04| And, you know, as one example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19984)|
| 5:33:06| Casswell Manor took 18 months to get built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19986)|
| 5:33:09| And then of course it's full right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19989)|
| 5:33:10| So this is really a problem that takes time to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19990)|
| 5:33:14| and it's really ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19994)|
| 5:33:15| And also, you know, some of these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19995)|
| 5:33:18| aren't able to get into CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=19998)|
| 5:33:20| So I know that's an issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20000)|
| 5:33:22| And then, you know, just getting these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20002)|
| 5:33:24| their stimulus checks that might help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20004)|
| 5:33:26| you know, pay a first month's rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20006)|
| 5:33:28| or just get them out of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20008)|
| 5:33:31| And then also trying to get these folks vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20011)|
| 5:33:33| is also something else I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20013)|
| 5:33:34| that should be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20014)|
| 5:33:35| So I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20015)|
| 5:33:37| And again, I appreciate the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20017)|
| 5:33:40| around finding these folks permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20020)|
| 5:33:42| I think we should put housing first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20022)|
| 5:33:44| and I think we should try to do more to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20024)|
| 5:33:46| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20026)|
| 5:33:48| Mr. Watson, your address please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20028)|
| 5:33:51| Oh, sorry, 229 Haywood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20031)|
| 5:33:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20034)|
| 5:33:55| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20035)|
| 5:33:59| The next speaker will be Tristia Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20039)|
| 5:34:03| Ms. Bowman, I've enabled you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20043)|
| 5:34:06| If you'd please unmute yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20046)|
| 5:34:09| and begin with your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20049)|
| 5:34:12| and you'll have up to five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20052)|
| 5:34:17| Ms. Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20057)|
| 5:34:20| Yes, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20060)|
| 5:34:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20061)|
| 5:34:23| I know that everyone has been here for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20063)|
| 5:34:27| So I'll try to keep my comments succinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20067)|
| 5:34:29| And I do plan to follow up with a written statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20069)|
| 5:34:31| because there are a number of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20071)|
| 5:34:32| that I'd like to address today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20072)|
| 5:34:34| But first let me introduce myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20074)|
| 5:34:36| My name is Tristia Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20076)|
| 5:34:37| I'm a senior attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20077)|
| 5:34:38| at the National Homelessness Law Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20078)|
| 5:34:40| We're based in Washington, DC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20080)|
| 5:34:42| We've been in existence for over 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20082)|
| 5:34:44| and we're the nation's only legal organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20084)|
| 5:34:47| whose sole mission is to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20087)|
| 5:34:48| and end homelessness using the power of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20088)|
| 5:34:52| There are many good things that I heard being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20092)|
| 5:34:56| in the Knoxville community today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20096)|
| 5:34:58| but there are still some areas of serious concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20098)|
| 5:35:02| One of the issues was addressed very early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20102)|
| 5:35:04| in this process that I'd like to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20104)|
| 5:35:07| in my short comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20107)|
| 5:35:08| And that relates to the balancing of harms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20108)|
| 5:35:10| when conducting sweeps of homeless encampments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20110)|
| 5:35:14| It is absolutely true that the CDC guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20114)|
| 5:35:17| does recommend a balancing that's always necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20117)|
| 5:35:20| when the goal is to protect public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20120)|
| 5:35:23| But there are a number of factors that must be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20123)|
| 5:35:27| in order to do an appropriate balancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20127)|
| 5:35:29| And unless those factors are included in the calculus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20129)|
| 5:35:33| to determine whether or not to conduct a sweep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20133)|
| 5:35:36| and the method by which to do it and where people go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20136)|
| 5:35:40| it's not being done consistent with CDC guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20140)|
| 5:35:44| or recommendations from the American Medical Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20144)|
| 5:35:47| and the American Public Health Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20147)|
| 5:35:50| The CDC requires, as people have noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20150)|
| 5:35:52| a balancing of risks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20152)|
| 5:35:53| but the solution is not to close camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20153)|
| 5:35:56| and displace individuals to congregate settings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20156)|
| 5:35:58| or other outdoor locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20158)|
| 5:36:01| It is absolutely critical in order to prevent harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20161)|
| 5:36:03| and to protect public health of all people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20163)|
| 5:36:06| not just displaced campers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20166)|
| 5:36:08| for there to be either individual housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20168)|
| 5:36:11| or other stable locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20171)|
| 5:36:13| where people who are in existing encampments to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20173)|
| 5:36:17| There is FEMA money available for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20177)|
| 5:36:19| There's a non-exhaustive list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20179)|
| 5:36:21| that has been published by FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20181)|
| 5:36:23| That money can be pursued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20183)|
| 5:36:24| to provide individual housing units or alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20184)|
| 5:36:27| consistent with local public health guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20187)|
| 5:36:30| There was a statement made earlier about HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20190)|
| 5:36:33| not permitting use of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20193)|
| 5:36:35| for that type of individual housing unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20195)|
| 5:36:41| if there are shelter spaces available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20201)|
| 5:36:42| And that's just incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20202)|
| 5:36:44| I mean, this is FEMA money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20204)|
| 5:36:46| And I'm happy to send over some, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20206)|
| 5:36:49| some written materials that explain the availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20209)|
| 5:36:52| of that source of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20212)|
| 5:36:53| as well as some of the rationale for using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20213)|
| 5:36:57| Part of the rationale for using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20217)|
| 5:36:59| is described right in the CDC guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20219)|
| 5:37:01| When people are displaced without a stable place to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20221)|
| 5:37:03| services are disconnected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20223)|
| 5:37:06| which is not a good thing for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20226)|
| 5:37:07| It undermines existing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20227)|
| 5:37:09| It also discourages use of the very good programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20229)|
| 5:37:12| that we heard described today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20232)|
| 5:37:14| And it's not a trauma-informed approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20234)|
| 5:37:17| nor is it the type of approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20237)|
| 5:37:18| that has proven successful in other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20238)|
| 5:37:21| Sweeps without a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20241)|
| 5:37:23| and that are done inconsistent with CDC guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20243)|
| 5:37:25| meaning sweeps that are done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20245)|
| 5:37:27| before there is a serious investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20247)|
| 5:37:30| in providing access to sanitation and hygiene services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20250)|
| 5:37:33| at the locations where people are usually in tents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20253)|
| 5:37:38| or other rudimentary shelters that are not ideal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20258)|
| 5:37:41| but that provide for social distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20261)|
| 5:37:43| at least as between tents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20263)|
| 5:37:46| is a really critical part of an approach to homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20266)|
| 5:37:51| certainly during the pandemic and even after the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20271)|
| 5:37:54| because homelessness is always a public health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20274)|
| 5:37:57| Again, in the follow-up written comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20277)|
| 5:38:01| I'll provide more detail about why that's been important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20281)|
| 5:38:05| But most, you know, what I'd like to leave everyone with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20285)|
| 5:38:07| is that the Law Center, since 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20287)|
| 5:38:10| has tracked 187 communities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20290)|
| 5:38:13| And what we have found is that sweeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20293)|
| 5:38:16| done without a plan to increase stabilization of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20296)|
| 5:38:20| rather than to just temporarily displace people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20300)|
| 5:38:24| into congregate settings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20304)|
| 5:38:25| or other temporary emergency settings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20305)|
| 5:38:27| universally fail to achieve constructive policy results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20307)|
| 5:38:31| They undermine the good work that you're otherwise doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20311)|
| 5:38:34| They don't help to connect people with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20314)|
| 5:38:36| Instead, they are ineffective approaches to homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20316)|
| 5:38:40| They can entrench homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20320)|
| 5:38:41| They can worsen the trauma and harm that people suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20321)|
| 5:38:44| They usually come at the cost of life-saving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20324)|
| 5:38:46| and critical property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20326)|
| 5:38:48| All of that undermines an adequate approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20328)|
| 5:38:51| to homelessness, and those approaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20331)|
| 5:38:53| have universally failed across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20333)|
| 5:38:55| There are better ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20335)|
| 5:38:57| I hear a community that is really investing in solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20337)|
| 5:39:01| and it would be a shame to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20341)|
| 5:39:03| to take a punitive approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20343)|
| 5:39:05| or a misguided displacement approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20345)|
| 5:39:08| at the tail end of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20348)|
| 5:39:10| that undermines the other good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20350)|
| 5:39:12| that's being done in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20352)|
| 5:39:14| So I'll conclude my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20354)|
| 5:39:15| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20355)|
| 5:39:17| Ms. Bowman, your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20357)|
| 5:39:20| The address is 2000 M Street Northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20360)|

| 5:39:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20369)|
| 5:39:34| The next speaker will be Dr. Sarah Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20374)|
| 5:39:39| Dr. Hawkins, I've enabled you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20379)|
| 5:39:41| If you'd please begin with your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20381)|
| 5:39:43| you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20383)|
| 5:39:46| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20386)|
| 5:39:47| Hi, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20387)|
| 5:39:49| Thanks for hanging in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20389)|
| 5:39:50| and having this really important conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20390)|
| 5:39:53| My name is Dr. Sarah Hill Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20393)|
| 5:39:56| I am a clinical psychologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20396)|
| 5:39:58| and I work at 538 West 5th Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20398)|
| 5:40:04| I am also here not just as a psychologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20404)|
| 5:40:08| and a citizen, but as a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20408)|
| 5:40:10| of a grassroots organization in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20410)|
| 5:40:14| called HEART, Healing East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20414)|
| 5:40:16| Alternative Response Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20416)|
| 5:40:19| My thoughts are gonna be a little all over the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20419)|
| 5:40:22| because I feel like we had a lot of good discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20422)|
| 5:40:25| about a lot of things that I wanted to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20425)|
| 5:40:29| I'd like to start first by thanking you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20429)|
| 5:40:32| for the opportunity to have public forum for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20432)|
| 5:40:34| I think it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20434)|
| 5:40:39| I wanna comment on some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20439)|
| 5:40:42| that Sergeant Clinton shared a few hours back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20442)|
| 5:40:47| In particular, he mentioned that there's issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20447)|
| 5:40:51| with charitable giving and over helping people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20451)|
| 5:40:54| who are experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20454)|
| 5:40:58| He said something to the effect of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20458)|
| 5:41:00| if we make it so easy to stay on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20460)|
| 5:41:03| and we make it comfortable like all the comforts of home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20463)|
| 5:41:07| then people aren't going to want to leave their situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20467)|
| 5:41:12| They're not going to wanna get off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20472)|
| 5:41:14| And I found that to be a very offensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20474)|
| 5:41:17| and overly simplistic perspective to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20477)|
| 5:41:24| And I would caution everyone here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20484)|
| 5:41:26| that that's his perspective and not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20486)|
| 5:41:30| the perspective of other service providers in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20490)|
| 5:41:34| Regarding the continual destruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20494)|
| 5:41:40| of homeless encampments and the destruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20500)|
| 5:41:44| of people's private property and possessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20504)|
| 5:41:47| much of which is, as someone mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20507)|
| 5:41:50| maybe all that those folks have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20510)|
| 5:41:53| I really wanna emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20513)|
| 5:41:55| that that is neither helpful nor humane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20515)|
| 5:41:59| And it is something that we are all part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20519)|
| 5:42:02| Something that we are all better than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20522)|
| 5:42:05| The CDC, as well as the other organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20525)|
| 5:42:09| that the previous speaker just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20529)|
| 5:42:11| have all said that our mission at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20531)|
| 5:42:13| during the pandemic is to make encampments safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20533)|
| 5:42:16| So let's put in some sinks, some more toilets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20536)|
| 5:42:19| some safe needle disposal, some trash and recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20539)|
| 5:42:23| and let's treat people like people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20543)|
| 5:42:26| FEMA has offered 100% reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20546)|
| 5:42:30| to transition folks experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20550)|
| 5:42:33| to non-congregate shelters through the end of September 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20553)|
| 5:42:36| And as we know, a lot of things have been extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20556)|
| 5:42:38| so this is something that may also be extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20558)|
| 5:42:40| and they are retroactively going to fund activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20560)|
| 5:42:43| from January 2020 until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20563)|
| 5:42:47| So I think this is a really important opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20567)|
| 5:42:49| that our city needs to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20569)|
| 5:42:52| I applaud the efforts of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20572)|
| 5:42:55| to include so many service providers in today's conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20575)|
| 5:42:59| but I strongly caution you against assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20579)|
| 5:43:01| that any of these voices represent the perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20581)|
| 5:43:04| of people who are directly experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20584)|
| 5:43:09| I'm concerned that there were not people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20589)|
| 5:43:12| who are experiencing homelessness, who are peer advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20592)|
| 5:43:17| sharing their lived experiences with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20597)|
| 5:43:19| I think that was a very missed opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20599)|
| 5:43:25| And lastly, or maybe not quite lastly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20605)|
| 5:43:29| Mr. Griffith was reviewing the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20609)|
| 5:43:32| for the Office on Homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20612)|
| 5:43:33| and I wanted to comment especially on priority one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20613)|
| 5:43:37| where he mentioned that there should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20617)|
| 5:43:38| a simultaneous increase in social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20618)|
| 5:43:41| and a decrease in police engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20621)|
| 5:43:43| I wholeheartedly agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20623)|
| 5:43:48| However, the co-responder expansion would not achieve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20628)|
| 5:43:52| I think we all recognize that increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20632)|
| 5:43:54| the co-response model would actually increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20634)|
| 5:43:58| police exposure and involvement and engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20638)|
| 5:44:01| with a vulnerable group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20641)|
| 5:44:04| So I think we need to consider an alternative response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20644)|
| 5:44:08| that does not require police to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20648)|
| 5:44:10| to nonviolent crises related to mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20650)|
| 5:44:13| substance use and houselessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20653)|
| 5:44:15| And finally, my last point, I'd like to remind council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20655)|
| 5:44:18| of the importance of person first language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20658)|
| 5:44:21| and talking about people experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20661)|
| 5:44:23| with respect rather than using homeless as a noun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20663)|
| 5:44:27| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20667)|
| 5:44:30| Thank you, Dr. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20670)|
| 5:44:35| Council, our last speaker is Mr. R. Bentley Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20675)|
| 5:44:40| Mr. Marlowe, I've enabled you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20680)|
| 5:44:41| If you would please begin with your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20681)|
| 5:44:44| you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20684)|
| 5:44:46| R. Bentley Marlowe, 322 Douglas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20686)|
| 5:44:50| Thank you guys for this very informative meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20690)|
| 5:44:53| I learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20693)|
| 5:44:54| A lot of it I've observed and witnessed myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20694)|
| 5:44:59| I'll admit I'm kind of tired and my arm's killing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20699)|
| 5:45:01| I got my first shot today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20701)|
| 5:45:03| Perhaps the Bill Gate nanobots are scrambling my brain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20703)|
| 5:45:06| but I'm quite confused when I'm thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20706)|
| 5:45:09| the meeting I sat through Tuesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20709)|
| 5:45:12| put on by city council movement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20712)|
| 5:45:14| where there were comments such as the city is engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20714)|
| 5:45:17| in social cleansing, police brutality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20717)|
| 5:45:21| and all sorts of things that I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20721)|
| 5:45:24| in six and a half hours, we didn't cover any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20724)|
| 5:45:27| In six and a half hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20727)|
| 5:45:29| we talked about how the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20729)|
| 5:45:31| goes out of its way above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20731)|
| 5:45:35| by any measure that I can reasonably think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20735)|
| 5:45:38| to assist our homeless neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20738)|
| 5:45:41| or houseless as they use the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20741)|
| 5:45:46| I'm really confused at reconciling the differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20746)|
| 5:45:49| in the communication from the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20749)|
| 5:45:53| And I believe that with the breadth of this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20753)|
| 5:45:56| and the breadth and depth of all the experts that spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20756)|
| 5:46:00| that I believe that this meeting is the more accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20760)|
| 5:46:03| more informative and factual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20763)|
| 5:46:09| I just wanna applaud everyone for staying in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20769)|
| 5:46:12| and applaud the city of Knoxville for all their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20772)|
| 5:46:15| And I mean, I'm just really simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20775)|
| 5:46:20| and my simple answer to some of these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20780)|
| 5:46:23| are simply if we need to know where to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20783)|
| 5:46:26| if we're going to break up a camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20786)|
| 5:46:28| and we spend all these millions of dollars on the shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20788)|
| 5:46:32| and I think we heard that there's about 150 empty beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20792)|
| 5:46:37| most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20797)|
| 5:46:38| I think the answer is we've run them to the shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20798)|
| 5:46:41| and if they don't like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20801)|
| 5:46:43| because I mean, let's honor some free will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20803)|
| 5:46:46| And I've heard that we wanna work with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20806)|
| 5:46:49| Well, we've got a jail and you're trespassing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20809)|
| 5:46:53| or you're illegally burning fires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20813)|
| 5:46:57| or you're shooting up drugs or you're stealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20817)|
| 5:47:00| or in possession of stolen property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20820)|
| 5:47:01| or you're indecent exposure, you're defecating in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20821)|
| 5:47:05| I think you just give them an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20825)|
| 5:47:07| That's your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20827)|
| 5:47:08| You can either go over here to the shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20828)|
| 5:47:10| which we, the taxpayers subsidize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20830)|
| 5:47:13| and we've spent hours talking about how these programs work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20833)|
| 5:47:17| and how we're constantly improving these programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20837)|
| 5:47:20| or we're gonna partner with our county associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20840)|
| 5:47:23| and then put you in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20843)|
| 5:47:25| where you at least get three hots and a cot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20845)|
| 5:47:27| and some rudimentary medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20847)|
| 5:47:30| And I'm looking at the jail site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20850)|
| 5:47:32| I have no idea what capacity is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20852)|
| 5:47:34| but they've got several programs inside the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20854)|
| 5:47:37| for addiction and recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20857)|
| 5:47:40| and for getting education and job training skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20860)|
| 5:47:45| I mean, do we have to reinvent the wheel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20865)|
| 5:47:47| Could we not maybe use some of these resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20867)|
| 5:47:50| that our county partners have that are just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20870)|
| 5:47:52| I mean, sitting there and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20872)|
| 5:47:56| between KPD and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20876)|
| 5:47:58| We've got paddy wagons to move people around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20878)|
| 5:48:00| It's just an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20880)|
| 5:48:01| I know it's not what everybody wants to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20881)|
| 5:48:03| but it's an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20883)|
| 5:48:06| I think everybody's in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20886)|
| 5:48:08| The status quo is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20888)|
| 5:48:10| And I for one don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20890)|
| 5:48:12| these encampments are the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20892)|
| 5:48:14| I don't believe they're acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20894)|
| 5:48:17| I hope that we can continue discussing possible solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20897)|
| 5:48:21| and finding the money to push forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20901)|
| 5:48:26| on finding a workable solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20906)|
| 5:48:28| But sometimes I think problems exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20908)|
| 5:48:31| that there are no convenient or right answers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20911)|
| 5:48:34| And we just have to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20914)|
| 5:48:36| that we've got to make the best that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20916)|
| 5:48:38| with what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20918)|
| 5:48:40| And if that's not good enough for certain people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20920)|
| 5:48:42| then I'm sorry, try to find another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20922)|
| 5:48:47| But asking those of us who live in the near downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20927)|
| 5:48:51| asking those of us who have built a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20931)|
| 5:48:55| and our livelihood and the livelihood of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20935)|
| 5:48:59| are all downtown, asking us to tolerate the intolerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20939)|
| 5:49:03| is simply not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20943)|
| 5:49:06| And from my observation, living next to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20946)|
| 5:49:10| the city of Knoxville has given adequate opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20950)|
| 5:49:14| social support, notice before they raid the camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20954)|
| 5:49:19| And I find absolutely no merit to any claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20959)|
| 5:49:22| that there's any police brutality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20962)|
| 5:49:24| or destruction of property without notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20964)|
| 5:49:27| Like that is just hogwash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20967)|
| 5:49:29| And I thank you all for sticking with it all night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20969)|
| 5:49:32| and good night and God bless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20972)|
| 5:49:34| Thank you, Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20974)|
| 5:49:38| Vice Mayor, that's the conclusion of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20978)|

| 5:49:59| if you guys could share your presentations with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=20999)|
