| 0:00:00| but I don't think we're going to create havoc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| So I'm going to continue to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=5)|
| 0:00:06| But I did want to say I think that's why it was left the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=6)|
| 0:00:10| Mr. Chair, if I could, if you don't mind me kind of barging in here with just a couple of observations and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=10)|
| 0:00:17| In terms of what appears to be a focus issue is the fact that we've got a lot of lots in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=17)|
| 0:00:28| that are going to be less than 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=28)|
| 0:00:30| And, you know, there is something to be said for, quote, unquote, fairness issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| That's not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| I think we're still going to have a situation where we have X number of lots that fall under the 250 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=37)|
| 0:00:45| and would not have the ability to apply for one of these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=45)|
| 0:00:51| And looking at what we've presented, we still have some, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=51)|
| 0:00:57| we still have some tight requirements even if you go down to 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| There's still some tight requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| Going to LED technology and being and chairing and staffing the Technology Corridor Development Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=64)|
| 0:01:12| we have started and we have received advice from lighting consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| And all you read nowadays is LED technology is the wave of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| And there are a lot of reasons it is and has a lot of advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| I'm not so sure it's always brighter than what you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| I know that we have found, we're finding in just regular advertising signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| the LED lighting tends to be less obtrusive, less, I don't know if that's the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| but less abrasive to the eye, more visually appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| It is also more energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| And there are a lot of things that speak well to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| So I think based on, and I'm not trying to pull a last minute play here to get you to a pass what NPCs approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=110)|
| 0:01:58| but I want to make sure I got those observations out there because I think there are a lot of things that are going to still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| with us regardless of how much more study we do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| As I say, I think there's still a lot in the ordinance that makes this a lot tighter than what it used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:14| Now, having said all of that, if you do choose to send it back, please be very clear as to what we are to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=134)|
| 0:02:24| I'm hearing some comments about, well, NPC needs to take a look about how to reduce sign clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| You know, that can be, you know, a two-month study or that can be a two-year study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| Please be very clear as to what we are to do and be as specific as you can so that we can get to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=157)|
| 0:02:45| We have a focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| We can get to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| We can come back with some more recommendation because, you know, we want to spend the amount of time that's needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| but we also don't want to let this thing drag out to where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| it's going to take us four or five months to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| We need something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| If that's what you choose to do, we need something that gives us some very specific focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Let me come back to myself in a second to deal with that since I'm the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| Let me go to Ms. Roddy now and then Mr. Woodhull and then myself and then Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| Councilman Pelow and I served on the original Electronic Message Center Study Committee quite a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=204)|
| 0:03:32| I think it started in 2004 perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| And my recollection, I concur with Councilman Bailey, my recollection is the study committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| and the original legislation that came forward to this council dealt exclusively with Electronic Message Centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| And it was, I believe, at the recommendation of Mrs. Cash, she's not with us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| who realized, and I see Mr. King nodding, that the changeable price signs were also a lit sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| They were also a form of an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| And so at some point in all the convoluted process of amending and going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| the changeable price sign language was added perhaps by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| so that we were addressing all types of Electronic Message Centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| And my recollection is there was not a significant amount of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| or study about the specific needs of changeable price signs as differed from Electronic Message Centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:29| In other words, they were just kind of swept in on the tide of the regulation of EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| I do think that there are significant differences that need to be taken into account in our center city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=275)|
| 0:04:44| I know in some of our residential zoning discussions, in Vice Mayor Becker's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| some of the areas that he represents, when you have a 150-foot residential lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| that brings significant issues that have to be addressed differently from larger, more suburban lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| And I think we want to continue to have businesses that can invest in center city properties that are smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:10| And as Mr. Johnson said, that street frontage isn't going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| That part's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| And changeable price signs already exist on those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| It's just that they are forced to use the technology with less energy-efficient bulbs that light up the whole sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| If you can picture them, you know, the message boards where you slide in, you know, the letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| and we've got candy bars on sale this week or whatever, and the whole sign is lit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| If you talk about ambient light into a neighborhood or into a roadway, I'm not an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| but to my estimation, that's more obtrusive than simply an LED number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| not to mention the carbon footprint that you're putting out with the larger signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| and the old-fashioned incandescent bulbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| So I continue to support the motion that I made earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| I'd like to see a compromise position to give some more parity to our businesses that are investing in these smaller lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| that need redevelopment, but then at the same time, look at our greater vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| And as Mr. Johnson said, I think our greater vision needs to be defined tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| but I think that's going to take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| I really resonate with many of the comments of Councilman Pavlis about building a beautiful city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:36| and a well-designed city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| And also, I know that we have taken a lot of time over the past several few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:50| to take some courageous steps in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| and there are going to be some inequities that will be produced in that transition, in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| I actually, and the business community is very adaptable and creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| and I think that they will, the level playing field will occur even in inner city neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| around a more beautiful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| I see establishments in my neighborhood in Mechanicsville operating well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:21| without the use of the signs that we're discussing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| So I don't favor a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| I favor sending this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| Well, I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| In your mind, Vice Mayor Becker, what is the difference between sending it to NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:43| and having a study committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| I'd be curious to know what your thoughts are around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| You sort of proposed it earlier, and then I'm, so what are you thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| I was going to call on myself to actually deal with that very question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| Can I call on you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| It's always a challenge when I'm part of the discussion and also chairing it, so I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| And I was actually thinking in the context of what Mr. Johnson asked about, how much do you want NPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| Do we want NPC to look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| At some level, I think there is a big picture question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| How are we going to reduce sign clutter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| It's sort of the resolution creating the study committee that we could untable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| and that's a big picture item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| Probably a year or more study, a lot of involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| What I would picture with what we're doing here in sending it to NPC is something very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| And I know we ask NPC to consider things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| As the maker, I would think that I would like NPC to come back with something that would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| price changer signs are allowed at 100 feet of street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| I could even see it being a little less or even significantly less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| If they are, say, you know, half the normal square footage or a monument sign or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| something like that that's a very limited, we're getting smaller signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| we're getting less obtrusive signs, but we're having more technically advanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| And I think the difference between that and the study committee is that's a very specific just for price changers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| The study committee, I think, is a much larger, I'm sorry, just price changer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| So the study committee would study what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| I think, you know, given it's a study committee, it would study everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| Toward what end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| I think the task that it was written up as is how to look at new technologies as a way to reduce sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=573)|
| 0:09:43| the visual pollution of signs or sign clutter or something like that, and that's a big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| I mean, it's kind of a medium size, which could be, you know, a deeper look at price changer signs or EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| But I think if we're going to delve deeply into this, it makes sense to look at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| So if we were sending it to MPC, we would be giving them the, as you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| the specific mandate to reduce clutter in the context of fairness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| I think sending it to MPC, not the study committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| Sending it to MPC is a very specific change in language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| Take what we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| And instead of, let me pull this up, the language we have that would say changeable price sign shall be limited to parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=622)|
| 0:10:38| with a minimum of 100 feet of frontage on the street where the property is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| It would be changeable price signs shall be limited to parcels with a minimum of 100, 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| whatever on the street where the property is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| If these signs are, you know, half the square footage of total signage or monument signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| something very limited like that, only for price changers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Mr. Greve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| If you read what MPC has already sent to us in terms of regulations, that basically what you're asking, I think, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:28| is that really a compromise on the frontage as far as the feet frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| and then also really the size of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| If you read in terms of what they're requiring, you know, the changeable price sign to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| I sort of question, you know, where you're kind of headed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| But I think the thing that worries me most about this is that I think we're forgetting about the greater vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| and the greater vision of what we want our city to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| And I think that, again, I go back to the fact that, you know, we banned billboards, we banned EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| and I think we have a situation here where there was a lot of work done to put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| And whether or not we're talking about technology or fairness of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| I think the thing that we really should be charged with is that greater vision of what we want our city to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| and the beauty of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| And I think we're all pretty well versed in the fact of what signs do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| and the clutter and the clutter that we have in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| And we have an opportunity to move forward and to take another bold step, which several councils behind us have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| And one of the things that makes for a better city and a beautiful city is the elimination of clutter of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| And so I think that that's the other thing that we should keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| is that what is the vision that we want this city to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Let me go to Ms. Palmer and then Mr. Dellivope and Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| We've spent a lot of time talking about a study committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| The MPC has asked for some real specific direction because very likely this ordinance that came about was based on a previous request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| What if we decided to have a study committee come up with some specific things we want MPC to do before we ask them to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:22| so that it's really clear and that we have the time as a council to hash this out, brainstorm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| come up with what it is we want them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| And then at that point ask real specific things from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| Let me go to Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| I guess I concur with Councilman Grief that we do need to keep our eye on the vision of what we want our city to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| However, as Mr. Bain pointed out earlier this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| that are not digital in nature, that do not have the LED lighting, that are backlit, are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=838)|
| 0:14:06| I mean, they're out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| And so businesses that are investing in properties that are below 250 feet are going to need to continue to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:19| And so what's going to happen is, you know, are we creating more signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Well, yeah, there's new signs that are going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| They're just going to be the old technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Now, is that more attractive in terms of beautifying our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| Is that more energy efficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Is that the route we want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| I guess I would rather see this motion amended tonight and bring down that minimum requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| so that new investment is at least more energy efficient and cleaner and more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| and then go forward with a very specific request to MPC in terms of studying the changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| Because I think the changeable price signs as a category were not scrutinized in the way that electronic message centers were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| when the four of us that are still in council were part of this extended debate previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| I definitely like when Councilman Roddy says things about cleaner and more energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| But I also think it's fair to say that we actually don't have a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| I mean, technically, we don't have a bullseye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| But many of our actions are implying a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| And so that's why it feels a little confusing to study or to send it to MPC when our vision is still somewhat implied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:47| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| I think Ms. Palmer actually had a great idea, that idea that we ought to talk about what we want before we send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| When I was saying, when I was reading this, I noticed Buzz Johnson writing it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| And I thought, well, that's, you know, he's got what I want, but what do the other eight people want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| And I guess, Ms. Palmer, I guess what you're suggesting is that we, that the nine of us sit down somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| and figure out what we actually want to do with this sort of absent the idea of what's the motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| and be a little more free thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| So I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| I think we've almost talked this thing to death, and I like the discussion of vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| and of some concrete direction that we can come up with as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| I just want to say I've been looking at the zoning regulations, and maybe I'm misinterpreting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| but it talks about, you know, 40-watt incandescent lights and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| and I don't see a single word about LEDs and energy efficiency and all of that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| And I think that's part of what we have to get on paper and send to MPC to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| And I think, I mean, they measure light rays in nits, whatever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| God help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| But, you know, you can have so many in the day and so many in the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| but it doesn't say LEDs anywhere in this regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| So I think it's important to get it straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| Let's sit down and spend the time we need to get MPC to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| and set ourselves short but reasonable deadlines to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| Let's just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Let me, as a chair, Ms. Palmer, I think since I said you had a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| how do you think we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| What's the step to do what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Because I like your idea, and I'm not quite sure how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| Perhaps some independent brainstorming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| and then bring the independent ideas together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| and see what kind of overlap we have, where we're very far apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| And I think figuring out what the vision really is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| because my vision of a beautiful Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| and Councilman Woodall's vision of a beautiful Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| and Councilman Grieve's might be 100 percent alike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| or they might be so opposite that we need to figure out some compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| So I would suggest that we do some independent brainstorming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| and then bring that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| And does your vision sort of somehow say let's postpone what we're talking about tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| Yes, it certainly does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| I thought it was going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| Well, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Was that a motion that Ms. Palmer made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| I did not hear one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| We've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| I thought we had a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| We have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Would a motion to postpone take precedence over Ms. Rodney's motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| that has taken precedent over my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| I will second Ms. Palmer's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| To postpone for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| Four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Everything's coming up then, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| We're going to have another marathon in four weeks, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| Why don't we do it six weeks and that way we can postpone one of the marathons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| So there's a motion to postpone for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| And I guess part of what goes with that is somehow council figure out what we want to do with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| in a little more informal fashion, although a public process fashion, but a little more informal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| I'm sure that Mr. Swanson can help us move along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| Yes, the look he just gave me aged me a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| I guess I was just going to say I think we need to articulate very clearly what we hope to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| in the next six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| And I'm not sure I really hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| It's pretty amorphous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| Would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| I have some thoughts, but please, what's your thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| I wasn't paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| What I think is there are two questions we should deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| One is do we want to take on this big picture of visioning how we want science to fit into a beautiful Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1204)|
| 0:20:15| The second, and I think this is a little more Ms. Palmers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| which is the smaller vision of what do we want MPC to do on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| And I like the idea of rather than saying to MPC, go think about these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| bring back recommendations for us to say this is what we'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| So I would think that it's a, I think, both questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| but a focus on the smaller picture ones, if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Focusing on the smaller issue could be difficult if we don't know what our vision is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| And maybe we have no vision, and that could be the issue that is at the bottom of these multiple hours of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| So perhaps we need to fine tune the vision and then go to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| And that doesn't have to take the rest of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| I don't see any other lights right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| The motion on the floor, as I understand it, Mr. Swanson, is a six-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| And if that fails, then we go back to Ms. Roddy's one to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1273)|

| 0:27:23| We are looking then at the group of 202 monies that are being appropriated by this council for various projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Will we read the captions or what are we going to do so we know what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| Well, I think the idea is that you would vote to approve all of those that are before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| The motion is to approve 12P, excuse me, to vote on 12P through 12Z at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| We're not voting to approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| We're just voting to vote on them at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| It's just a procedural part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Mr. Becker, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Now we're going to go back and vote on 12P through Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Any discussion on any of those items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| These are all the community fund grants from various members of council to various civic organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| We need a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Any discussion then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| I wanted to, after I got out of the big seat there, a couple of thoughts came to me of how we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| with Ms. Palmer's idea of thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| And I actually wanted to ask if there are a couple of council people who would like to think out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| and figure out a process for how we do what we just said we wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| I guess I want to ask Ms. Palmer if she would be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| And I see Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| We do have one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Jim, if you'll come down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:09| Name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Mall Rick 551 English Village Way, apartment 917, zip code is 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:20| I'm going to change what I was going to say a little bit tonight because of what you just spent an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| and a half trying to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| But the main reason I'm here is I think it was the last meeting I spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| And some of the feedback I got from some of the council people is there was a vicious rumor going around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:46| that I'm smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| Did you come back to challenge that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| And it's not out of humility or anything, but I'd like to set that straight, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| I'm a C student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| And that's in my younger years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| I'm probably closer to F now, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| And I don't want people to think that you've got to be smart to stand up here and challenge what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:17| All you have to be is a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| But what I want to do, and it's going to be over the next minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| and when the gavel hits five, I'll shut up and then I'm coming to the next meeting and continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:39| Because what I want to do is point out to you how one citizen comes to the conclusions that he has come to, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:51| And I'm not the only one that's done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| And I'm not very creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| I steal ideas and I don't create ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| The method that I use, for a better word, and it's not a very sexy word, is observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:15| I see with my eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| Doing that, here's what I see, and this will come up later on when I show up, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:31| But I want to point out one because it's fresh in our mind right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| Councilman Roddy came close to the way I would have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| And I was back there cheering, go a little farther, and Councilman Greene jumped in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| I said, oh, you're almost there, but nobody got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| What you've got to decide is what kind of a city you want this to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| Do you want it to be an urban city or a suburban city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| I think we're getting big enough, we've got to go the urban way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| Now, you're talking footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| What you should be at, I mean, if you send something to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| if you say in the policy and you run on a platform you want to make this a more urban city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| they'll give you one answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| If you say we want a more suburban city, they're going to give you a different answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:28| But right now, they don't know what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| So we're arguing over 100 feet or 250 feet, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| Now, the 100 feet, he's trying to do something in the urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| And we talk about beauty, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| When I go out to Turkey Creek, and I don't know what anybody else thinks, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| But when I go out there, which is the only time I go out there is my son wants me to deliver something out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| And every time I go out there, I want to fill up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Now, you know, everybody else may think that's the most beautiful place on earth, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| Because all that is is suburban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| You can't compare what he's doing with Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| Nobody can even tell you where the center of Farragut is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| It's not an urban city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| It's not trying to be an urban city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| And, you know, I wasn't there when the 250 feet was figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| But I'll lay money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| The majority of people there were suburban people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| And not urban people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| And the other part, and we got to make that decision, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| Because as I talk about some of these other issues, you're going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| you got to decide which way we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Because right now, I think we're going suburban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| And, you know, we got to make that decision first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| And then I think you'll see this stuff roll in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| And the things that I'll be talking about, okay, around the issues, you know, about city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:25| what I see now and what I see before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| we'll talk about public participation or we are, you know, in other words, we are not being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| We heard that a little last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Parks and public space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Homelessness and sovereignty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| And the way it will work, I did something similar to that in a previous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| I think Councilman Pavlis was the only one that was sitting on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:57| What was the subject, Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| He don't even remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| About 30 more seconds, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| The book you gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| And, you know, then I can just continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| Now, let me point out one other thing for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| Look at the city buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| You got traveling billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| Now, I don't know if any of you got any complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| I don't know if her organization has complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| I complained on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| And I had a big fight with Tad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| I sit on that advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| And I lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Now, she'd tell you or she calls you tomorrow and she looks at them and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| I don't know how you miss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| They're traveling billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| She'll say they're not beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Now, Sam Anderson can tell you why I said not to put them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| Two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| But and why do you have them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| For the same reason he wants to put a sign up for revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| You can move toward a conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100504part2?start=2173)|
