| 1:21:34| are appropriately trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| for the protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| of these rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| I would like to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| the other insure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| But I'm open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| to suggestions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| Ms. Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| Would the insure situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| need to happen first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| I'm okay with having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| that discussion first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| and then going after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| It doesn't seem like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| anybody put their lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Then I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| In my experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| both as a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| with two children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| in Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| and also as a board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| we have some really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| excellent teachers and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| that I'm so grateful for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| that have helped me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| and my children so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| but also my parental friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| and their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| and that we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| have some great educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| And I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| also as a board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| and walking into schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| and having school visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| and seeing the positivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| and the effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| that they put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| I really, really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| all of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| and then also the stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| that they go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| when we have certain lockdowns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| So I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| I've read through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| and this feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| it really supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| our annual plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| of great educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| in every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| and retaining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| I would love to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| our teachers more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| and I would love to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| from them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| I heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| a few teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| who are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| West High School teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| but who have children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| at West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| and over the last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| and they were really afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| and speak publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| because of retaliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| and I really thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| that their words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| were important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| and I would have loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| to have had them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| to be able to speak publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| and for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| and their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| and I think something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| like this would empower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| them to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| and the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| with last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| I think there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| a couple letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| that were read anonymously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| from some of our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| and I would have really loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| to see those teachers' faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| and hear their voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| to say those words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| instead of someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| doing it for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| just so that they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| retain privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| so for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| I support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| and I would love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| to hear from teachers more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| I'm not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| opposed to the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| or the intent behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| but you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| I just would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| to note that the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| does govern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| through policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| just going into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| an election year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| I think we have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| some interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| in other elected bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| it kind of makes me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| just a little weary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| of resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| these days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| you know I certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| don't want to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| into a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| where we're considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| new resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| like I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| it's not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| with this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| but we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| policies in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| I do think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| to be mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| Thank you Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5106)|

| 1:25:31| any resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5131)|

| 1:25:38| that I disagree with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5138)|

| 1:25:41| I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| some ability to place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5143)|

| 1:25:48| any legal binding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| we would still have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| like if we felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5150)|

| 1:25:56| bring it up for a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5156)|

| 1:26:06| with using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5166)|

| 1:26:11| I'm very leery of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| the word insurer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| that equals a guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| guarantees are hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| to come by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| I did talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5181)|

| 1:26:24| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| and frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| should have talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5189)|

| 1:26:32| Tuesday about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| so I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| my concern was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| to reword it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5196)|

| 1:26:39| both of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| I had some suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| language but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| her resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| it's her resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| you feel that it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| have some legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| like I would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| the board making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| the statement to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| teachers that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| have a right to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| I agree with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| and I support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| to take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| and create some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| legal responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| that now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| he's got to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| based on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| if we as a board decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| that there needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| some procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| we can have a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| and do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| this does not create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| legal binding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| on the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| but it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| for the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| that they have the freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| to come here and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| without retaliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| and that's my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| I mean you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| if some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| let's say retaliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| occurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| at a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| by a bad actor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| what's going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| is in that lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| try to hold the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| superintendent responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| if we take out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| the second insurer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| eliminate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| I think that helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| but I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| my preference would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| to take them both out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| so take out both insurers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| I'll leave this to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| but I would prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| to take out both insurers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| I support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| and the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| but I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| that I'll vote for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| if both those insurers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| are in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| but I'd be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| to vote for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| if we remove both of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| I'd have to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5294)|

| 1:28:41| not the second one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| I was good with the second one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5322)|

| 1:29:01| about insurer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| I felt like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| the first insurer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| is the superintendent's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| responsibility anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5347)|

| 1:29:17| I felt strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5358)|

| 1:29:27| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5368)|

| 1:35:44| there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| a recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| of Pittsburg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| 55,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| in the District of Columbia, we are only short 48,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5758)|
| 1:36:05| We worked with US Department of Labor's data three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| You should have gotten a copy of our five-year national teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| shortage projection, but we show it this year at 366,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| It will only get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| Of that data, the most startling thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| is 40% of all new education grads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| will never go to work in a classroom after graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| I don't know if it's because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| a 26% wage gap between what teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| make and any other major, or if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| because we believe that six to eight weeks of student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| teaching the second semester of their senior year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| is adequate to prepare them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| But today, UNESCO released a report that said, by 2030,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5812)|
| 1:36:59| worldwide, we will need 44 million teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| And so there are a couple of things, really quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| I'm going to suggest to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| First, I shared with you a metric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| that we use that helps you monitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| are we doing what we need to do, and is it getting the result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| Second, I would encourage you, on a quarterly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| to do an ROI on your Title II Part A money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| specific to recruiting and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And the third thing is be in your schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| Go do lunch duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Go do bus duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| Encourage your churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| Encourage those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| And finally, if I just might have 15 more seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| a couple of years ago, I got to meet Eminem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| And I wanted to meet him to ask him why it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| three years in a row, in ninth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| he returned to Detroit Public Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| And he was just as surprised to meet me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| and that someone asked him that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| And he said, in all sincerity, I kept thinking I'd show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| and there would be someone who cared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| someone who really cared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| This teacher shortage is a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| And so as you look at your staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| I would encourage you to hire those people in our buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5903)|
| 1:38:29| in our classrooms, in our janitorial staffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| in our cafeterias, and on our school buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| to hire those who really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5921)|
| 1:38:41| Thank you, Renee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5921)|

| 1:38:46| Is Melissa here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| Melissa is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| Alexis Rhodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Alexis, if you will state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| and then you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| My name is Alexis Rhodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| I am a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| And due to my limited time to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| and my hatred of public speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| I find it best to be blatantly honest with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| I thank you for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| But to be frank, I'm not happy to be giving you my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| This time I'm giving you belongs to my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| The fact that I feel the need to be here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| further is what KCS continues to take from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| Six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Six minutes is all the time my son had from me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| My son arrived home on the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| And six minutes later, he begins his therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| He was still partaking in that therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| when I left to come here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| And he'll be sleeping when I get back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5980)|

| 1:39:44| And last year, I had to fight for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| just to get those six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| You see, my son started kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| And he wanted to ride the big yellow school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| We had concerns regarding some safety protocols of KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| And so we requested an IEP meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| to accommodate those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| At that meeting, we were told that the least restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| environment was not required, nor would it be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| Six months later, after more meetings, emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| and administrative complaint filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| with the state in the resulting training and corrective actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| for KCS mandated by the state, my son now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| rides that big yellow school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| But it shouldn't have taken me six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| to get those six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| The task force outlined a cultural resistance issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| within Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| This culture runs deep and is like a cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| It has invaded nearly every administrative person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| I have interacted with at KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| And although I don't have time to go into specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| six days after this board passed a measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| to improve special education, Lisa Wagner and Alicia Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| wasted no time in maintaining this culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| After expressing my concerns as to their disregard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| for the private practitioner policy implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| for ABA services within the school setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| I again found myself spending countless hours sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| dozens of emails, fielding their hostile phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| consulting with an attorney, all to have my original concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| finally not just be considered but resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| by Mr. Jason Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| My point is that this culture of resistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| doesn't stop with the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| Rather, that's really just where it begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| It continues on with us parents and advocates continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| being treated like uneducated nuisances in our attempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| to have our children's basic needs met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| But the years of chess that KCS has made us play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| in special education have turned us into grandmasters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| And this culture of resistance will end with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| My son's needs will not be sacrificed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| to help balance a budget or soothe an ego no longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| It's exhausting being a parent to a special education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| student at KCS, and I am tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| But so long as my community needs advocating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| I will find the energy because my son deserves more than six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| minutes of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| With that, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231004?start=6123)|
