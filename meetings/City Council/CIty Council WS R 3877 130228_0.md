| 0:01:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Well, we've got just about everybody here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| First up, we're going to we've got two issues to speak to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| And just a point of order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| Do we want to I would suggest that we do public forum after we discuss the courtyard developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=100)|
| 0:01:48| because everybody here may not be here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| And they may want to sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| They may not want to sit through the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| So if council agrees with that change, we'll okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| Seeing heads shaking, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| We're going to deal with the courtyard development first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| And I think we've got a presentation by Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| I'll just review how we've got to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| Let's start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| NBC staff for a number of years has been working to create a new zone district that we're calling R1HK for R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=140)|
| 0:02:32| Heart of Knoxville to be utilized in those neighborhoods that were developed prior to World War II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=152)|
| 0:02:41| in a development pattern that is basically inconsistent with our R1 zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=161)|
| 0:02:51| which is ruled by a minimum lot width of 75 feet and a minimum lot area of 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=171)|
| 0:03:01| Our draft R1HK zone district allows lots to be created much smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=181)|
| 0:03:10| We're basically reverse coding some of the Heart of Knoxville neighborhoods where lot widths are as narrow as 40 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=190)|
| 0:03:19| and lot areas as small as 4,000 or 5,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| and neighborhoods that have a variety of housing types within the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=204)|
| 0:03:34| We've also incorporated some of the design standards that are currently reflected in our infill housing overlay zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=214)|
| 0:03:44| district so that a new R1HK zone could replace both the base zone and the overlay zone in several neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=224)|
| 0:03:58| and still provide design standards that are compatible and reflective of the housing types of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=238)|
| 0:04:11| So we've had that in the works for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| We haven't moved forward with it at the request of previous administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| And upon learning about the provision in it for courtyard developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| which are one of the housing types that we would like to allow within the R1HK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| City Council requested that we take a look at considering courtyard development as a use permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=273)|
| 0:04:43| within any of the residential zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| And the recommendation, so we've taken the standards that were proposed for courtyard development within the R1HK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=288)|
| 0:04:58| and isolated those and the Planning Commission recommended that the courtyard development be listed as a use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=298)|
| 0:05:09| permitted on review, which requires site plan approval by the Planning Commission prior to any permits being issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=309)|
| 0:05:23| For zone districts including R1A, RP1, which is the planned residential zone district, R2, R3, R4, and O1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=323)|
| 0:05:36| which includes the uses of R2 by reference then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| So I have to make sure that listing is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| RP2 and RP3, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Yeah, all of the RPs, RP1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| We did not recommend for the R1E, R1, EN1, and EN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=355)|
| 0:06:05| One reason is that EN1 and EN2 already have a provision for infill development through the use on review process through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=365)|
| 0:06:14| which you could get to a courtyard style development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| One of the reasons for including the R1A is that currently many of the neighborhoods within the heart of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=379)|
| 0:06:28| where we were looking at utilizing the R1HK zone district are a combination of R1, R1A, and R2 zoning currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=388)|
| 0:06:40| and some of which are such a mixture that it's almost a checkerboard of R1A and R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=400)|
| 0:06:49| So we would like to provide the opportunity for courtyard development in those types of neighborhoods as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=409)|
| 0:07:05| So I would expect that, you know, we had pushback on R1A at the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| and I would expect that you'll hear of that today, but it's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| Our initial intent was to include this as a provision in this new R1HK zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=439)|
| 0:07:29| which would probably have a very limited possibility of being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| limited to those neighborhoods that were in the city prior to 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=456)|
| 0:07:51| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| Mark, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| One, if you would go back, you were saying that R1HK was sort of the picked up the tone of the pre-World War II kind of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=475)|
| 0:08:06| What caused the shift to specific zones with sort of comparable type housing so that R1 was single family, one on a lot, and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=486)|
| 0:08:16| In other words, was there a trigger for the change later on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| We have two different systems in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| Well, we've had multiple development patterns with only one system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| The initial zoning ordinance that was put in place I think had just R1, R2, R3, and R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=511)|
| 0:08:42| It might have even had just two residential zone districts, R1 and R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| But that was applied post-development to the neighborhoods that were already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=528)|
| 0:08:56| and the R1 is I would characterize it as a very suburban zone district with the minimum lot widths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=536)|
| 0:09:04| and minimum lot areas that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| And most of the neighborhoods in what we refer to as the heart of Knoxville, you know, Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=547)|
| 0:09:17| Fourth and Gill, Old North, Lonsdale, Wood Lincoln Park, South Haven on the other side of the river, Morningside, Park Cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=557)|
| 0:09:26| All have lots that are smaller, much smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| You know, the average probably is a 50-foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Well, that takes me to the first one was historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| As I read the material that you had provided for MPC and now for council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| I get the sense that what drives this is infill housing and the desire for some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=586)|
| 0:09:54| That seems to come through and there's talk about, I don't know, maybe a sense of neighborhood community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| or something by grouping houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| I see that coming through, but I wonder how that interfaces with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| neighborhoods that have traditionally one house on a lot whether the lot is big or whether the lot is small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| And that seemed to be where the objections were coming in before MPC when community members came in and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| well, you're increasing the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| All these zones that we're talking about, at least the R1 and the R1A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| and those were, you know, up to six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| I guess a lot of them were built with one unit per lot, however big the lot is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| But I don't know of many lots other than in that inner city that are smaller than about a quarter of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| And when you build a subdivision, maybe they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| But it comes down to how do we get, once we get R1A, for example, into this storyline of courtyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=646)|
| 0:10:56| we can get densities up to 12 units an acre by definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| even though theoretically they are low-density residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| So we have this sort of conflict, this courtyard activity allows you to double the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| That seems where the tension comes in about how much are we changing the character of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| If you were to conflate possible with probable, that, you know, you could talk that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| But that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| Just because something is allowed doesn't mean that it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| We've had one regime of economic development that rezoned all of the land within a thousand feet of the railroads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=695)|
| 0:11:43| to industrial, and we're still trying to get rid of that after 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| We had another regime that came in and rezoned all of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| or a lot of the neighborhoods to R2 to encourage redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| And that never happened, and we're trying to get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| And we've had in the established neighborhood zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| we created the possibility of accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| So we have three square miles of established neighborhood zone districts that have been in place for three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| or four years now, and we haven't had a single application for use on review for an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=736)|
| 0:12:24| It's like the mother-in-law house building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Yeah, which could double the density of a lot of one-unit-to-the-acre subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=746)|
| 0:12:35| It doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| The data suggests that over time, one of 100 units might have an accessory unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| That's been the experience around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| So as a use permitted on review, it does create a barrier to that general possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=766)|
| 0:12:56| It allows a tool to manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| And frankly, in the mind of planners, neighborhoods with a diverse style of housing are more stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| and more sustainable than neighborhoods with a single style of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| And it's something that we ought to encourage in appropriate places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| and the use on review process is a way to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| I was just picturing the 12 houses on a one-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| It sounds like a lot of houses to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Now, I know we have condo developments that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Well, and we already have within the R1A zone district, we have apartments as a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=812)|
| 0:13:40| at up to 12 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| They occur sporadically on smaller lots so that you might have a fourplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| or a sixplex on a lot that's not an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| So is this a horizontal apartment now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| We've got a series of 12 units sitting on an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| Well, we've got a little bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| It's kind of scattered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| I don't know that there's any one particular type that's developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| but it happens very, very rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| And courtyard development is a niche market that will happen very, very rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Well, let me sum up my question this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| If I've got 12 houses on a one-acre lot, it seems to me there's not going to be very much courtyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| for all this public communal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| I mean, I could picture several houses in a cluster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| but some reasonable amount of green space where people gather, grow little things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| and, you know, chat instead of neighbors reaching out and grabbing the cup of sugar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| from the house that's almost touching them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Well, let's just go through the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| and we'll use 40,000 square feet for an acre rather than 43,560 because it's easier math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| Yeah, because we can do it in our head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| And we'll use 10 units to the acre instead of 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| So you could create footprints for small houses of about 1,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=895)|
| 0:15:05| That's fairly typical for courtyard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| That's your maximum, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| Under the regs, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| So you have a footprint of 1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| and you have a lot created that's twice that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| So you've got a 2,000-square-foot lot times 10 is 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| You've used up half of the acre with your lots that have been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| You're going to use up some of the balance for a parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| because the most common pattern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| to cluster the parking spaces off of the individual lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| although many of them have a mix of a variety of types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| So that leaves you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| half of your land area capable of being either the courtyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| or utilized for common uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Many of them will have a common storage building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| or a common clubhouse and a common parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| What keeps you from or what standard do you use to decide when my plan comes in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| well, this is a nice and attractive and functional courtyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| and this is an awful attempt to squeeze too many units on a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| and take advantage of the neighbors kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Well, we do have some standards built in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| and criteria for making that evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| which allow the planning commission to compare the proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| to the development styles that are adjacent to it in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| and mimic the setbacks along any street and the roof patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| and the porch patterns that may exist within the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Why don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| I just wanted to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Let me go to Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Councilman Saunders, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| I guess my initial, just what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| it's a niche zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| So, I mean, there's really, I mean, how much, how do you judge how much demand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| I mean, if you had people come in and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| I mean, I haven't had anybody call me and say, hey, I think this is a really good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| and I'm really a proponent of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| So, I mean, are you getting people asking you for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| I guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| We've had a couple of inquiries about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| and a couple of people are monitoring this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| I see, in my opinion, I see some of the best use in what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| a mixed use in a new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I would be afraid of the incompatibility with existing neighborhood stock to put in this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1058)|
| 0:17:47| Even a lot of your duplexes and your fourplexes and your sixplexes are not compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| and they stick out and, you know, they always run afoul to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| A lot of times they run afoul to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| So, I mean, I see it in, when you said a mixed use, I see it in a new, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| as a step back from commercial to office or the bridge from multifamily to office or office back into residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1084)|
| 0:18:13| I mean, I see it in a mixed use and a large style development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| But I'm really afraid of it in the R1 zones and certainly R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| I'm afraid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| I just don't see it fitting in and being compatible with your existing stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| It's easy to take four or five houses, tear them down, they're vacant lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| and the next thing you know, you're right in the middle of a neighborhood where it just wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| And it's up to use on review, if I understand it, to determine whether it's compatible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| And one of the very common configurations that's being utilized is to take lots that are along a street frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1122)|
| 0:18:54| and put new houses that literally are identical to all of the houses along the street frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| and put cottages behind them, either an additional cottage or two additional cottages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| or sometimes even three additional cottages behind a house that faces the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| that absolutely mimics what you see up and down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| I've seen that in Minneapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| We've seen it elsewhere throughout the Midwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| And then in the Northwest, they're actually using it in situations where you have kind of an estate-style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1166)|
| 0:19:36| development with very large lots, five-acre parcels with a mansion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1176)|
| 0:19:44| And people are going in, buying the existing house and doing cottage development on a five-acre parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| again, putting structures that orient towards the street that mimic what you see along the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| but then having a different housing style hidden behind that major house that is on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1200)|
| 0:20:09| So there are any number of ways that you can go about doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| I think one of the things, a couple of things that are good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| there's a book out called Pocket Neighborhoods that everyone ought to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| in terms of what is happening around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| I think it was interesting, Mark, I know up in the Grosse Pointe areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| when I was living up in Detroit, that that's what's happening up there, the large mansions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| They're keeping the mansions, but then they're putting the clustering around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| And I think one of the things that we need to realize is that we're not talking about the typical duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| or fourplex that we see right now, that, again, if you take a look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| we're really looking at a whole different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| It's like what you're saying, Mark, where you keep the street front the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| which is within the neighborhood, and then depending on the amount of property you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| you know, putting the houses in behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| I mean, I think it has possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| And, again, I think it's just another opportunity in a way in which housing can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| I think the big question is where do you allow it in what particular zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| But I think it has a lot of possibilities in terms of what could happen as far as future housing goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| I agree with Councilman Grieve that I see some real possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| and I also see some real black holes in this concept and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| I'd like to know some of the cities in Tennessee that have adopted courtyard housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| and how has it worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| Nashville has several examples of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| I think Mike's been by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| But the typical configuration that we're seeing there is that they are using it in an infill-type situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1311)|
| 0:22:01| where they're maintaining the existing pattern along the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| and then filling in behind it with cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| But that's in their existing older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Yes, Germantown and East Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| Germantown is Memphis, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| There's a German village in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| The context of those neighborhoods is very much like Forth and Gill, Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1350)|
| 0:22:43| I don't know if you have the illustration here that was in an early draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1363)|
| 0:22:53| This is eight houses on probably 24,000 to 30,000 square feet and a small courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1373)|
| 0:23:03| But generally what they've done in those areas is they'll put the houses at the same distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| back from the street, four in a row, and then put the cottages back behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| The one in German Village has been exceptional as far as sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| The original price of the cottages was $180,000, and now they've become so popular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| because it's in-town living and people don't have to commute from those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| It's gone up to $250,000 to $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| It's just about two or three blocks from the capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| So if you all will remind me, I'll go take some pictures and bring them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| You'll bring us dinner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| They've got good restaurant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| It's worth a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| I have, in light of what Mike has said, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| As I have looked at this type of housing in many places, it's often very attractive to seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| And it's not necessarily in the $180,000 to $250,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| So my question is, are we looking at this as a possibility for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| or are we looking at this as a possibility for high-end housing or is it mixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| It literally satisfies several of those niches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| And in addition to that, there is a growing movement that's categorized under the phrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1468)|
| 0:24:38| aging in place, where communities are trying to provide a variety of housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| to accommodate households as they age through their life, from newlyweds to young families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| to mature families to empty nesters to widows and widowers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| so that folks can move to a variety of different housing styles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| without disrupting the relationships that they've developed with their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| over the life of their household, from their churches to their doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| to the pharmacy down on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| And that is a growing theme in the planning world and in the health world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| of making accommodations to allow households to age in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| I live in a neighborhood that is, you know, one unit to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| I know five widows who would love to live in a little cottage in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| and stay in the neighborhood, but it's not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| Yes, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Yes, thank you, Mr. East Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| I used to live in East Nashville, and I'll ask you later, other than the Germantown section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| where those houses are, but I want to ask you here locally, do we have any examples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| I think we had some information in one of our previous packets of courtyard development already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| There's a little area off of Sutherland that was originally developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| with houses around a little circular drive with an open area inside the circular drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| that would kind of fit this definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| Currently, they're being used as offices, because that particular neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| is kind of making the transition from housing to more commercial activity in the form of offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| But the road that provides access to those offices is literally a gravel driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1602)|
| 0:26:51| through this courtyard, what acts as a courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| And the units face into the courtyard rather than out to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| Well, the key to me is what I'm hearing is it's going to be a more dense situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| And I'm trying to get my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| What is the upside of creating more density in neighborhoods, especially in older neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1631)|
| 0:27:20| What's the upside of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| Well, in our mind, there are a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| It'll probably take a while to cover them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Well, you can just cover one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| We don't want to be here all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| One, the idea of encouraging infill development is a way to minimize the need for greenfield development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1652)|
| 0:27:42| extending your infrastructure out beyond where it currently is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| by utilizing the infrastructure that's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| It's a way to encourage investment in neighborhoods where we may have seen disinvestment over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| It's a way to encourage a more sustainable density than the density that is currently there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1677)|
| 0:28:06| If you look at the single family housing stock in Knoxville, it is about one unit to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1686)|
| 0:28:17| Whereas we've got pockets of the community, such as Fourth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| that's probably at eight or nine units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and becoming less over time as people reclaim those houses from small apartments to big houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1708)|
| 0:28:37| But it is a way to increase the number of taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| who are supporting the infrastructure that already exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| rather than increasing taxpayers and having to pay for new infrastructure to provide services to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1728)|
| 0:28:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| I was just going to say, Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Forest Court off Sutherland Avenue is an example, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| of where they tried to make that attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| But I think also if you go along Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| you have Boxwood Square, which could have been what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| but instead they went in and divided the whole thing up into lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| and have individual houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| But they could have easily done the perimeter and had the center area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| like what we're talking about with the possibility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| I also know that there is another place there on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| that there's several of us looking at that are interested because we are, believe it or not, getting older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| And so we were talking about wouldn't it be nice to be able to take one of the old houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| and that could be a place where, you know, it would be a place where it would have some bedrooms in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| and maybe, you know, a rec area and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| But then we would still have our individual cottages around the grounds and have the open area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| Some of the folks that are interested in this want a little garden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| and some want for flowers and vegetation and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| And so I think it has a lot of possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| And I think it could happen in a lot of different community areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| or a lot of different neighborhoods along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Another area on Kingston Pike is Anttila, which is on down the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| which is not what we're talking about as far as the courtyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| but it was an attempt, I think, where it was a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| And what happened is they went in and they divided all the land up into individual lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| So you don't really have that courtyard type feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| But, again, I think it's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| And I think with use on review it, you know, could possibly work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| But I think the other thing is like you're saying is how much real demand at this particular time is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| versus, you know, five, ten years down the road, which is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| I was wondering, I saw a reference in the MPC public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| or general meeting you had with the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| And there was a commendation to Laura Cole for suggesting why don't we build one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| or allow one of these and spit shine it and let it be the shining example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| that we can all decide if we love it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| And everyone said, great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| And then you put it in eight different zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| And I'm thinking, well, that didn't quite seem like we were going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| And so I guess I wonder, I mean, I hear this side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| And I did look at the pocket neighborhood book that Mr. Holquist circulated, very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1886)|
| 0:31:34| But what keeps someone from going in and doing sort of, I don't know, you go into a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| you knock down one or two houses, you maybe put the one facing the street, like you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| that mimics somewhat the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| And then you build a bunch of second, I don't know, section eight bungalows in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| that you're renting and you've changed the character of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| I mean, how do you keep it from crossing the line from, gee, that's interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| we've got a spot that's flexible that we allow, you know, maybe older folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| or empty nesters to move into smaller space and not leave their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| to now we're going to come in sort of with a wrecking ball in terms of the sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| of private home ownership as opposed to rental units or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| Maybe there's a control in here, but that's the part I'm struggling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| Well, rental versus owner is always going to be a struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| We cannot control that through the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| But city council can manage this through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| The zoning ordinance provides the authority to approve uses on review to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| but any decision of the planning commission is appealable to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| So the use on review tool is a very good way to monitor what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1969)|
| 0:32:57| If we got a huge demand for it and we had a pattern of less than desirable standards being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1977)|
| 0:33:08| we could incorporate design standards that are greater than what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| But we do have, in fact, some standards and criteria for design features that are incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| in the use on review process to at least take a look at what's being proposed on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2000)|
| 0:33:29| and make sure that it mimics what's, you know, surrounding it in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| I see the planners collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| They're moving towards form codes and mixed uses and more of like a village type kind of development idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| as new areas get worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| And I understand that there's some value to that of, in essence, building a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| I just was concerned about the downside and how we could control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Well, I'm just going to counter back to my friend Duane over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Comparing it to Boxwood Square is a stretch in Antela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| Because what I've seen, I mean, that's not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| Those are all individual lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| It didn't have any common area whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| They could have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| I'm in good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| But they had a struggle with the market they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| I mean, even when Boxwood Square was built, it was not popular right off the bat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| because it was all two-story houses on those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| And then Antela had its own struggles as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| So it wasn't overly popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Now, I mean, right there off of Sutherland, it's Century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| It's right there in front of Finbar's neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| What's the street there right to the left, Century?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| Oh, Century Court north and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Now, Century Court would be a lot closer to what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| where they have a common area out in front of the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Century Court north, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| That is probably a lot more, is a lot closer to what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| It makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| I have no problem when you're looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| My problem is the infill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| It's not compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| I don't see it being compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I see too many places where you can tear houses down or houses are already torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| You can grab a few lots, and it almost becomes a spot zoning somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| That would be my fear of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| In a new, some of the other places you're talking about it, it might have appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| Not, I don't know, but the infill is probably my biggest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| So the R1A is the one, is the piece I have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Councilman Steger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| That's sort of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| I mean, is everyone, do we all sort of feel the R2, R3, R4, and the rest is okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| The issue is sort of R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| I guess my question is, for Mr. Donaldson, is what is the advantage and disadvantage of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| or not having R1A included in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| R1A is currently a zone that we recommend for use within those parts of the land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2166)|
| 0:36:14| that we classify as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| And it's used broadly throughout the heart of Knoxville neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| which are classified as low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| And it, by including R1A, you eliminate the need to amend the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2187)|
| 0:36:37| both in the sector plan and the one-year plan, in order to do a project such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| So if it's, if we didn't have R1A there, what's the drawback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| What's the downside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| If you had a site that was appropriate for it and it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| and it's classified as low-density residential in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| and the one-year plan, the applicant would have to go through three approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| rather than a, three zoning approvals, rather than a use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| And it would, in fact, lead to spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| Well, I guess my other question is, if R1A is a low-density zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2241)|
| 0:37:29| it's a low-density, not a zone, but overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| How could we allow this, which is 12 units per acre, which would not be low-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| in the low-density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| The same way that we currently allow R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| R1A currently allows small apartments to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| at a density up to 12 units to the acre on their particular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| But keep in mind that the overall density of a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| may go from 1.1 unit to the acre to 1.15 units to the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| as a result of that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| So for that particular neighborhood, could there come a point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| people could not add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| That certainly could be a factor in the approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| for a use permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| is that we are approaching that point where there is too much density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| and it no longer fits, generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| within the classification of low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| But in that case, would you have a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| where one property owner is treated different than another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| One property owner is able to have, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| another dwelling unit on their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| but once you reach a certain limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| then you tell this other property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| that they cannot have another dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| and that doesn't bring up any legal ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| You mean like equal protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| As long as you have a rationale for making that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| and you've gone through the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| I'm just trying to figure out how the zones match up with the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| Fourth and Gill is much greater than six units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| We love it, and the land use plan says low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| I'm just trying to figure out how the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| and the sector plan and the zoning map all work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| and how this fits into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Couldn't we always, if we wanted to proceed with this less the R1A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| we could come back and amend it and put it back in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| if the sky wasn't falling and the demand...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| You could do nothing and wait until R1HK is in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| and act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| I'm just saying it's just an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Could we also reduce the density from 12 to, say, 8 or 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| and have this be a reasonable type of zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| Because it seems to be a concern to have such density on an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| So if we decrease the number of units from 12 to 8, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| then that would decrease the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| If density is a big issue to you, yes, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2426)|
| 0:40:35| I don't see any more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Back to that comment you just made about just put this on the side for a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| and wait until the R1HK comes before us because I was not aware that that was in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| If it is, that to me is a very interesting concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| and begins to, in my mind at least, better define at least where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| And especially in neighborhoods like you mentioned, Forth and Gill and perhaps parts of Old North, Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| they do have, parts of it have pretty high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| As a matter of fact, there are some areas, interestingly, in Sequoia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| in Old Sequoia right in the middle, down off Scenic Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| where there is a huge park and a bunch of very small houses on very small lots all around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| Those were developed, I guess, post-Second World War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| I'm assuming that was the Deaver development out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| You're very familiar with it, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| And there's another development kind of off Southgate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| Beyond the library and around where there is a, it's not a courtyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| but it's a little cul-de-sac and about six homes around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| George, you might know the way to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| Anyhow, the heart of Knoxville thing appeals to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| And I would like to know a whole lot more about it than what the proposed definition is and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| And you've mentioned a lot of the neighborhoods that it might include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| We will move to, seeing no other lights, we will move to the public forum discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| And if you'll give your name and address and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| Thank you, members of Council, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| I seem to have been at this for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Let me make something very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Everybody knows you, but you still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Oh, Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| Let me make this very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| I think Knoxville should have every possible type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| I just don't agree with Mr. Donaldson that it should all be on the same block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| and that if it is all on the same block that that's the strongest block in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| because that's not been my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| When you have a single family detached home sitting next to a small apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| sitting next to a single family detached home on a larger lot sitting next to a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| I will bet you those are the low value streets in this town, not the high ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| Now, maybe in some other towns, and I've lived in some other places where that may be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| but that's not here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Let me also make some statements about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| The one-year plan is what controls density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Low-density residential, less than six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| Medium-density residential, I think it's up to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| Several of us in the community wondered when R1 and R1E were recommended for courtyard development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| inclusion of courtyard development at 12 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| how they were getting around the one-year plan, if they just overlooked it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| And we're glad they were taken out by MPC, the R1 and R1E zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2626)|
| 0:43:54| because that made absolutely no sense because R1, R1E are only in the low-density residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| R1A is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| It's in the low-density, the medium-density, and another thing called traditional neighborhood, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2644)|
| 0:44:14| Regarding apartments in R1A and low-density, apartments, multifamily, in R1A is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2654)|
| 0:44:25| The first standard for use on review is that it shall follow the one-year plan, the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2665)|
| 0:44:33| So it's my position that if you're going to put an apartment building in a R1A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2673)|
| 0:44:41| the density has got to be less than six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| If you want to put in greater density, the use on review for the multifamily would mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2685)|
| 0:44:53| that the one-year plan would be amended to medium-density residential to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| Let's also be very, there was a statement made at the MPC meeting in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| that we needed R1A because it was a way to get the higher density without amending the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| I stood up and said I was absolutely opposed to that, and I remain absolutely opposed to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| and I don't think that's what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I think that's an end run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| And now we understand, according to the one-year plan meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| that MPC is considering recommending getting rid of the one-year planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| which will take a vote of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Obviously, we're going to be down here opposed to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| Density is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| It's not an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| It is what characterizes a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| It's wonderful to talk about infill and then talk about keep the mansion and build behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| I'm sure that's on more than an infill-sized lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| And I have to agree with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| This makes me very nervous when it comes to infill because what you're going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| especially in the less expensive neighborhoods, which includes mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| where you still have some R1A zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| if someone can come in, take down one house or two houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| build 12 units per acre, rent them out, sell them, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| that there's no resemblance, is in no way in character with what else is on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2779)|
| 0:46:27| They may be small houses, but they're single family detached on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| The other thing that, aside from the density issue that was raised by Courtyard Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| was the whole idea of how much protection is offered by use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| MPC would like to believe that with use on review all your problems are solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| If you don't like it, it can be turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| That's not my understanding from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| And, in fact, the zoning ordinance says that MPC shall give substantive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| factual statements as to the adverse impact in turning something down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| And there's similar language for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| So one can't just say, oh, it's use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| So if the materials look too cheap, you guys can turn it down because that doesn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| Also statements that, oh, yeah, the facade has to match whatever's in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| but there are no standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Now, I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| But I've been around this long enough to know that saying something has to be kind of sort of similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| and change this and change that with no clear standard is an awful hard thing to uphold in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| That is why overlays have very clear standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Specify the roof pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Specify the types of windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| It can't just be kind of sort of in the eye of the beholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| Kind of got to look like some kind of eclectic neighborhood with 14 different housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| So let's not kid ourselves as to what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| Regarding the exact language, which I haven't dealt with, particularly regarding this, let me tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| it's a pig in the poke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Almost every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| You're going to have to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| I shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Almost every single standard that's in here can be waived by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| I didn't have this list before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| Joe Holquist, 2240 Fisher Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| I think a few of you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| As someone who's been advocating for this, Councilman Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| the question about whether or not this should be strictly put under HK, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| a new zone that's not yet been created, I don't think it's an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| I think there's a clear justification for taking a close look at that and perhaps proceeding in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| There's a lot of rationale for going with the HK zone to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| and perhaps use for rezoning existing neighborhoods that would fit better than the current zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| especially R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| But that generally, I think, will take place in general rezonings where you MPC may initiate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| or council may initiate it or council member may initiate it, like I know I did in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| in at least one neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| But you're not talking about necessarily a small area, but probably a pretty good area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| perhaps a whole neighborhood at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Those are going to be very slow in coming and difficult at times, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| just like any general rezoning would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| So I think that that's something that has to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| And I know from looking at this and thinking about it a lot and thinking about parcels that I'm familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| especially in the district that I used to represent, which is mostly South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| there are some very unusual parcels sprinkled around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| and I know it's not true just of South Knoxville but the entire city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| that don't really fit the communities around them real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| There's not, you know, the existing street grid, the street pattern, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| Sometimes those streets literally terminate at these parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| And I can think of one that's very close to where I live, not in Island Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| but very close in South Haven neighborhood that is about five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| And the owners say that eventually they'll redevelop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| They don't know what they're going to do with it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| But it would, the older streets terminate to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| It doesn't really fit any kind of layout that exists now, and you wouldn't see it from the other streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| It's a unique example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| And I think that's why we need this to be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| this approach to the courtyard or pocket neighborhood development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| Allowances to be codified in the zoning ordinance so that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| we have the flexibility of allowing it where it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| And I think that there are unique examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| Now, in terms of appropriate zones, you know, there are 1A arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| I agree with what former council member Malone says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| And I think she has a very, makes a very strong argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Do I agree with her 100 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Well, maybe, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| We have yet to sit down and really argue this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| But I have tremendous respect for her, and I know where she's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| I understand those concerns and her insights based on a lot of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| So I would go with what some have said, Councilman Wallace, Vice Mayor Pavlis, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| suggested that R1A be left out at least for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| And I think that would be my recommendation because I think that's sort of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| that seems to be the feel for what's coming here, a political reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| is that maybe council as a whole might not be comfortable taking that step because there really are some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| that are going to be there until there's a higher level of comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| And I don't think that comfort level is there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| So I would suggest that council move on this, adopt it, with the exception of R1A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3127)|
| 0:52:16| and that can always be addressed and added in the future if once we get some experience under our belts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| collectively and decide whether or not this is really a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| And if somebody wants to go that route, it's a little more difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| but they can go through a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| And, again, that gives that extra level of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| And it definitely comes back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Parenthetically, I'll say that I understand former council member Malone's concerns about use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3159)|
| 0:52:47| And I think I said this to at least one or two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| And I know Mr. Donaldson wouldn't be real happy with this without additional funding to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| But I'd like to see consideration at least of a change where council, even an individual council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| or perhaps all of council or perhaps two or three members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| however it could be structured best, could essentially reach down and take something that has been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3185)|
| 0:53:12| under use on review and bring it to council for appeal without the citizens having to pay the fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| and initiate the process so that council itself could initiate the appeal process on use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| And Mr. Donaldson tells me he's not real happy with that thought because it's going to cost them more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| And I think that's a very legitimate concern, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| At that, I will conclude my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Martha Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3221)|
| 0:53:51| My name is Martha Olson at 2809 Scottish Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| I think most of you know me as a community activist, but I'm also a landscape architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| And I have gotten my contractor's license, and I'm hoping to start building small houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| And there seems to be a lot of interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| And so this is why this particular issue is important to me because I've been following a lot of the email groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3251)|
| 0:54:22| and discussion groups on small houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| And there is a big demand for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| One of the very common things you'll see is people wanting a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| And a lot of it, as you talk about, is the downsizing people, the downsizing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| the aging people wanting something less maintenance and wanting to have the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| So that's why I will urge you all to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| I think this is something that we're coming to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| It's not something we've done, you know, just because we haven't done it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| But I think it's one of the trends that we're going to be seeing in housing over the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| And if we can have it to where you can have the courtyard and actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| design it to promote community, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| I'll put in a plug for my profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| You could require a landscape architect to stamp it, and that might, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| give the wood maybe a little extra for the people just trying to slap something together as some are concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3319)|
| 0:55:29| So I've been buying some property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| One of them is in one of these overlay zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| It's off central, I think, I want to say traditional neighborhood or neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| It's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| They have a very, very well-defined spelled out, you know, what they're looking for in the way of siding and roofs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3342)|
| 0:55:53| and all that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| And so I'm a little confused because I was under the impression that something like that would go along with the courtyard zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| I mean, it's not, you know, sort of a ñ it's pretty well specified and you have to put in an application and you have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| you know, go before a board and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| So I think that, you know, I think I would imagine you would have something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3371)|
| 0:56:21| But admittedly, that's not something I'm too familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| I think this is something that can be an asset to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| And there can be kind of odd lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| And it sort of depends on the neighborhood to neighborhood, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| You might have a neighborhood that's struggling, that having an influx of new homeowners might really bring the neighborhood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3397)|
| 0:56:44| And so, you know, that's ñ I absolutely agree that it should be a use on the ñ you know, there should be neighborhood input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| There should be a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| And if this, you know, it needs to be compatible with the neighborhood and it needs to have the support of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3412)|
| 0:57:03| Personally, I would ñ you know, I absolutely agree that the R1 ñ it doesn't belong in the R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3423)|
| 0:57:11| It doesn't belong in the EN and all the estate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| It doesn't belong there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| I differ in that I feel that it should be allowed in the R1A just because if someone has a piece of, you know, two lots or three lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3437)|
| 0:57:31| and they might be suitable for this kind of development, it would be a whole lot easier to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3451)|
| 0:57:39| I want to get it rezoned R1A than if they say, well, I'm going to get it rezoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| Well, the neighborhood would be justifiably concerned that, hey, this is, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| That something could happen and it would just be one of the standard apartment buildings like we see all over, you know, the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| So I also ñ I'm also confused about the density, about the 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| I think that's a good density, but no more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| But, you know, if you have to rezone it to allow 24 units per acre in order to have that, that's a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| because neighborhoods aren't going to want to go along with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| even neighborhoods that are supportive of having this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| You know, the developer could, you know, it could change hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| So I think that's something that needs to be looked at, but I am very supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| and I feel like just because it hasn't been a real big thing in the past, I think it is going to be very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| And the things I'm reading on the Internet, on the, you know, blogs and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| is that there's going to be a lot of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| And this is something that Knoxville could really stand out by having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| and providing this kind of opportunity to seniors from around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| who are looking to relocate and want a nice climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| And they're going to want it to be close to stores and bus lines and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| So I think it really would be good to be able to make it comfortable so it's compatible with infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3543)|
| 0:59:11| So ñ and infill in existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| And I think we just need to have good standards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| I don't know whether Mr. Frost or Alva or someone else can explain this, maybe Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| But what is the ñ I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| What is the input that the neighborhood has outside of, like, a one-year plan or a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3572)|
| 0:59:41| when it's just purely a use on review activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| In other words, how does the neighborhood get involved in that process as opposed to deciding how the plan looks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3584)|
| 0:59:53| Is there a restriction in terms of the invitation for comments and hearings and all that type of stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| Well, generally speaking, your meetings for a one-year plan or, you know, plan updates, those address whole areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3599)|
| 1:00:08| They don't necessarily get down to the minutia of little properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| The plan has lot-by-lot changes, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| But when you get to the use on review process, that's, you know, the rubbers meeting the road a little bit more right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| because you're talking about a specific proposal for a specific piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| And, you know, the folks who oppose or support the project, that's when they would, you know, could say their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| And depending on outcome, they could appeal to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| Mark, do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| We provide public notice for uses permitted on review in the same manner that we do for individual lot plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3642)|
| 1:00:50| and changes to the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| We publish in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| We publish on our Web site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| We mail notices to adjacent property owners within 200 feet of the edge of the proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3657)|
| 1:01:05| That's one lot in each direction, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| One or two lots in each direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| And then we post a sign on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| And do you allow time for comment on the specifics of the plan, including the appearance of the sign and the details?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| We hold a public hearing for every case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| Let me recognize Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| My name is Len Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| During one of the public meetings concerning courtyard development, I asked a very naive question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| And the question started out, I've got no problem with courtyard development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| If people want to have it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| It's another tool for builders, for developers, and nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3712)|
| 1:02:00| In talking about some of the problems, I said, well, why don't we just create a courtyard development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| You get it rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| And we can, if somebody wants courtyard development, you get it rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| Everyone knows what's coming and that takes care of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| And staff corrected me and said, oh, no, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| That would be spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| Well, I think we're looking for a legal way to do a little spot zoning here and just not call it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| It's a wonderful tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Let's don't mess with the whole town starting this thing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| Let's get rid of R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| Councilman Wallace made some good points about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| If people with R1A need it, we can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| We can change the zoning ordinance again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| On the R1A business, to clarify, because it's very murky, R1A can be in two different types of land use classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3770)|
| 1:03:00| It can be in low density, which would give you up to six units per acre, no matter what you call the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3780)|
| 1:03:08| It can be in medium density, which will give you 12 units per acre if you have the acreage for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| That's the thing to remember about R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| Just because you say it's now courtyard development does not automatically give you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3798)|
| 1:03:25| as long as we have the one-year plan, which controls, read the MPC website, read their handouts that they give out every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3805)|
| 1:03:36| one-year plan still controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| I would urge council to go slowly on this, to either hook it to the new upcoming zone for the older city areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3819)|
| 1:03:50| and Mr. Dela Lope, to answer your question, when did zoning change to parcels instead of just everything together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| It changed in 1938 when we got a regional planning commission in this town for the first time, and we've had it ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3837)|
| 1:04:05| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| There you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| We'll see you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Mark, why could we not have it as a separate zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| That's the same question I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| Well, if you created a zone where the use by right was courtyard development at up to 12 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| that takes away the discretion of the planning commission to control that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| and you would in fact have to go through a plan amendment of both the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| and the one-year plan to utilize a 12-unit-to-the-acre zone district in an area that's classified as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3886)|
| 1:04:58| If you found a parcel within an area that was zoned R1 or R1A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3898)|
| 1:05:06| and had low-density residential land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| and everybody agreed that that would be a good spot for a courtyard development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| you would have to amend the sector plan, amend the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| and amend the zone district in order to allow that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| and it would be a spot within that general classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| But if I could just respond to the previous comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| the Metropolitan Planning Commission was created in 1956, not 1938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| The first city planning commission was back in the 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| Ben?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| Okay, we have one more question here, and we're going to move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Yeah, I was just going to address it maybe to my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| and that is, you know, there's a lot of interesting aspects to this proposal that we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3953)|
| 1:06:02| but I don't see any harm in going in sort of light and then changing as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3962)|
| 1:06:10| I mean, if it turns out to be a really wonderful thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| then we can increase the number of zones you can do it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| We can raise the density, but why do we have to be all in at first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| And maybe we could have it crafted so that the maximum density is six, eight, ten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| something like Councilwoman Palmer said, eight, unless they show, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| sufficient reason and evidence to MPC why the density should be increased on a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| But I would rather see us go in light, tread softly, see if it's working and desirable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| and then we can always come back and say, let's broaden it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| Once we throw open the door, we're going to have grandfathered parcels everywhere that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| or may not prove useful to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| So I'd like to see us just step in lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| If anyone's interested in changing the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| or eliminating a particular type of zone, at Tuesday's meeting, this is on Tuesday's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| submit that they make a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| If you're wanting to delete R1A, you just make a motion to amend it to delete its applicability to R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4036)|
| 1:07:25| That wouldn't mean it would have to go back to MPC or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| And for the density issue, if you wanted to make it less dense, you'd make a similar motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| but they probably ought to be two separate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| With that, we'll move on to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Again, Carly Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| I think it's very important that we pay attention to the one-year plan, to the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| to the low-density residential versus medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| I'm just going nuts at the idea that somehow if we look at it sideways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4076)|
| 1:08:05| and squint, we can get 12 units per acre or 8 units per acre in low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| because we call it SI versus MI, and that somehow that doesn't violate the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4091)|
| 1:08:20| I mean, the one-year plan, low-density residential, up to six, less than six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| Regarding R1A, if you want courtyard development at 12 units per acre in R1A, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| Just amend the one-year plan to show medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| I believe in truth in advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| If you're in for 12 units per acre, don't say it's low-density residential because you found some way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| Say it's medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Have a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| Let people decide whether or not they want to do it publicly without squinting and nodding and blinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| That's my only position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Can I add one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| If we take R1A out, for example, we'll have R2 and other ones that allow medium density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| so we can solve that problem by not walking into it headlong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| Because I was troubled by that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| I mean, you have your communities that get together and look at the one-year plan with MPC and the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4164)|
| 1:09:31| and then that's laid out and it's sort of a zone of protection in terms of what's going to happen on individual parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| that come up, and then we'll have this conflict if we sort of violate that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| What she's saying is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Twelve units per acre is not low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| It's medium-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| R2 is medium-density, and that's really what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| Just call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| It's R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| We eliminate R1A, and then we go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| And I think that's really my biggest stumble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| That eliminates a lot of the infill opportunities that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| So now they have an R1 property, and they're here to do courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| They're here for a rezoning to R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| Then we can decide whether it's compatible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Tune in for more Tuesday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| Sounds like it's going to be a doozy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| We'll go to number five on the agenda, which is, again, Mr. Donaldson, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4228)|
| 1:10:38| They have led a little more tortured path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4238)|
| 1:10:48| I see a November 2011 date suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4248)|
| 1:10:56| There have been amongst a whole number of considerations of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| But the last recommendation that we made was after a city council workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4261)|
| 1:11:10| and after amending staff's recommendations at the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| to reflect comments made at the meeting by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4276)|
| 1:11:25| Frankly, it's been so long I can't even remember them to summarize them very succinctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| The gist was that rather than managing crematories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| we were going to manage funeral establishments as a use permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| and we were going to reduce the number of zone districts that funeral establishments were permitted in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4303)|
| 1:11:53| acknowledging that facilities for cremation were considered a part of a funeral establishment by state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4313)|
| 1:12:04| that has been supported by a fairly recent court case and one really old court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4324)|
| 1:12:15| And then in doing so, we created definitions for a variety of the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| that we needed along the way, cemeteries, columbariums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| and provided for memorial gardens, columbariums within cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4349)|
| 1:12:41| We also made a provision to consider crematories and animal crematories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4361)|
| 1:12:49| as uses permitted on review in the industrial zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4369)|
| 1:13:03| What else do you want to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4383)|
| 1:13:11| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| I understand that some of the language has been adjusted, and this is directed to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4393)|
| 1:13:20| Do you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Is this a good time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| Angela Halver and I spent some time talking about these different issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| and I definitely want to say we think MPC has done a yeoman's task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| in working to grasp a very difficult topic matter that sometimes can seem like Jell-O because it's morphed over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4419)|
| 1:13:54| And a lot of time has passed since this originally came up, and we had a workshop that was snowed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| I thought we were going to have that again this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| But there are some things that when Angela and I have spoken, we'd like to politely suggest some further tweaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4443)|
| 1:14:14| some things that, you know, at the very first workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| a large amount of time was spent covering a large amount of material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| and some things might have been lost in translation or, you know, just simply misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| And we want to, you know, take an opportunity to talk about those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| and also take into account, you know, some of the suggestions of different community groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| some of which, you know, they heard what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| and Angela think council's intentions were, but it didn't necessarily match up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4487)|
| 1:14:56| One thing that we need to remember is that these structures are, by Tennessee State Court of Appeals law, crematoriums are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4496)|
| 1:15:12| They're part of the funeral business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| We're not able to regulate them as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| They're going to be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| So suggestions that we call them an accessory use are really going to be ineffective for trying to appropriately site these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4523)|
| 1:15:39| You know, we looked over what NPC came back with at their most recent meeting, which it was in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4539)|
| 1:15:51| It's been going along for that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| And, you know, looking at Town Hall's suggestions, they were wanting to talk about the crematoriums need to be certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4554)|
| 1:16:09| and that language was missing from what NPC said or suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4569)|
| 1:16:17| Crematoriums have to be certified by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| No matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| It's not necessary that that language be in the city ordinance because they have to be licensed in order to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4582)|
| 1:16:32| licensed by the state of Tennessee, excuse me, in order to be in business at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4592)|
| 1:16:40| They also talked about the definition of a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4600)|
| 1:16:47| And, you know, I'll definitely get together with Mr. Donaldson at a near date in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| And, of course, Mrs. Halber can come along, too, for her input as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| But, you know, we've got some permissive language in some of the definitions when we respectfully submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| We need some mandatory language, changing some mays to some shalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| It provides better clarity for people who would perhaps like to make a crematorium in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| and also provide a little clarity for those in whose vicinities these might want to be cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4642)|
| 1:17:37| Further going on, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4657)|
| 1:17:44| There's a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Town Hall takes or brings to our attention the definition of a funeral establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| and specifically Part E facilities for cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| Mrs. Halber and I would submit that that probably can be eliminated because it's not well defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4677)|
| 1:18:05| A very general tenet of law is you can't regulate what you don't define.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4685)|
| 1:18:13| So, as she'll talk about here in a little bit, a new topic has come up, which we think you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4693)|
| 1:18:25| Well, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| I've worked it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| Like I mentioned earlier, Town Hall was suggesting crematory be an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| The Court of Appeals decision, you know, we wouldn't be able to allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| One thing that we think was lost in translation was the distance requirement, the 500-foot distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| You know, originally it was suggested over 2,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| We didn't think that that was possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| There was talk about 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| Maybe it was Councilman Della Voppe who talked about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| if scientific standards could prove that you could cite it closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4745)|
| 1:19:13| That would devolve into a battle of the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| And, you know, you could have a situation where someone, a proponent of these, could find an expert that would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4757)|
| 1:19:28| well, this technology is so clean you could live 10 feet from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| I don't want it any closer, so it wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| But you have a situation where you could have a community, business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| or group that can't afford to go out and hire an expert to look at the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| So I think the idea of what we talked about that maybe got lost in translation was that it was going to be a 500-foot standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4792)|
| 1:20:00| and that hard number you would do away with any experts that might have different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4800)|
| 1:20:11| And if you just put it at 500 feet, you made a clear standard that the person wanting the crematorium could understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4811)|
| 1:20:19| and the people in the vicinity could easily understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| The variance process is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| For some reason, you can prove, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| I don't understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| I mean, are you proposing that we're going to postpone this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Or rewrite it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| No, there's some suggestions that we're going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| And Angela and I think, yeah, we're going over it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| And it's ultimately because of these changes, we'll unfortunately have to go back to MPC one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| So eventually this will get done, hopefully sooner versus later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4849)|
| 1:20:58| Other language that we think needs to be changed regards, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| the funeral establishment to better define what one unit is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| We also need to improve the definitions concerning what things are primarily related to cremations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4869)|
| 1:21:18| versus primarily related to the funeral business because we've talked about one-third of the total floor space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4878)|
| 1:21:26| There's a little ambiguity in there that needs some further refinement to what I think was the intention of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4886)|
| 1:21:36| at our previous workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4896)|
| 1:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| So the document in front of us is not what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| Well, I mean, the document in front is what everything's going to be based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| I mean, we're needing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| You're tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| You're not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| We're tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| We're improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| We're not ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| So then we should just go to public comment and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| I'd like to discuss one aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| In just looking at this quickly without regard to the details that they're going to get into in fine-tuning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4936)|
| 1:22:23| it strikes me that when you look at, what is it, Article 5, Section 3 under funeral establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| I think we need to have more clarity in the floor space sort of designated for the cremation aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4949)|
| 1:22:41| It seems to me that that's really loosey-goosey in terms of what we're trying to restrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| But I think that it should say that if we're going to use the 33 percent floor area of a funeral establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| we should say that it's, add to the devoted to, that it's the entire process of cremation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| whether it's the facility unit itself, whether it's the bone grinding feature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| whether it's the floor display area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| But in other words, the idea of cremation could take up a third of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| But the unit itself, I've seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| They're probably three feet wide and 20 feet long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| and you're never going to be more than 33 percent of the building if we focus on the little burner thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| I think we have to take the floor space dedicated to cremation as the cut point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| between something that's part of a funeral establishment incidentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| and something that's primarily a crematory that goes to the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| And that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| We ought to look at that aspect of that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| And that's, you know, the very last page of our comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| Because there are some uses in a funeral facility that will be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| whether it's for the public service or traditional burial or cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5037)|
| 1:24:05| All those chapels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| That's why we came up with a proposed language to further hone that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| where it better defines what things look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| You know, Council was wanting to address one-third of the floor space for things primarily associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| with the services dealing with cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| But I'm just suggesting as you look at the wording that you not focus simply on the device itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5066)|
| 1:24:32| because there are other adjunct activities and floor space used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| And if you don't take that into account, anybody can say it's less than a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| I mean, I think you just throw the doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| I don't see any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| No other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| We'll go to the public forum section then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| I think we've obviously still got some work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| And I feel like we're aging in place as we continue this with crematorium maybe dying in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5102)|
| 1:25:10| But I appreciate the work that's been done by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| I think this has come a tremendous distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| And also the work that's being done by your trusted legal counsel in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5117)|
| 1:25:25| Our main concerns at Fountain City Town Hall is to make sure from a legal standpoint that something that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5125)|
| 1:25:37| principal use, and we're talking crematory as part of a funeral home, not freestanding industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| but as part of a funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| We want to make sure that as a principal use that crematories in a funeral home can be limited in space relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5146)|
| 1:25:58| to the other services offered at the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| In other words, that you can enforce legally the 33% or whatever percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| And we assume that areas devoted strictly to the cremation process as well as viewing areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5168)|
| 1:26:16| and any other maintenance areas specific to cremation will be part of that 33%, not just the crematory box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5176)|
| 1:26:27| But I've tried to think of other areas where we've said the principal use can be limited relative to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5187)|
| 1:26:38| principal uses on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Like we don't tell Walgreens that their pharmaceutical area has to be no more than 33% or no less than 50% compared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5200)|
| 1:26:54| to their skin care and hair care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| Or with Kroger, you don't say your vegetables have to be a certain percentage compared to meat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| or that you even have to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| And that's why the accessory use thing was so appealing, and I understand it from a legal standpoint based on lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| We're not able to use it as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| An accessory use by definition is subordinate in size and use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5234)|
| 1:27:22| So one of our concerns, because we don't like surprises, is just we want to make sure that from a legal standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5242)|
| 1:27:29| everything is buttoned down and that we can limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| Because you'll also notice in the definition of funeral establishment, it says you can have all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| you know, chapels and areas to view the deceased and all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| It doesn't say you have to have any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| And what I know you don't want and what I know our neighborhoods certainly don't want is to suddenly wake up one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| and there's the crematory on the hill saying funeral home and it meets all the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| and we can't do anything more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| We just want to make sure that, you know, our expectations and your expectations are legally grounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5280)|
| 1:28:07| And, again, I appreciate all the work that MPC, the law department, and city council has done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5287)|
| 1:28:15| We feel it's also very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| We agree with Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| The 500-foot thing from a daycare center or existing home or whatever should be an absolute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5302)|
| 1:28:29| that can get a variance but not be arguable, bringing in the need to hire experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| What I was going to say, I was going to offer, when Mrs. Halberd and I talked, I made notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| As I did last time, if people, if you all would like to try to decipher my notes, I'm happy to provide them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5327)|
| 1:28:56| I mean, it's some, it's some, we had some legal conversations about going on how to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| give certainty to people if they want to go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| So there's some, you know, some minutiae and some things that need to be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| Charlotte Davis, 104 Crawford Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| I just want to make a very brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| I would ask that before a crematorium becomes a part of any community that the residents of that community be involved in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5359)|
| 1:29:31| This is a courtesy that was not extended to the residents of Fountain City when the crematorium was added to Gentry Griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5371)|
| 1:29:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| Let me just say, I know that there have been some questions about the 33 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| And the reason that the city and Rob, we believe that that's enforceable because we have used it as a standard for other zoning matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5396)|
| 1:30:06| And one example is with sexually oriented businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| In order to be defined as a sexually oriented business, a business has to have a certain amount of its business devoted to sexually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5412)|
| 1:30:27| oriented materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| And that number that we use to trigger that is 33 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| Can I just ask, is that part of the zoning ordinance or part of some other regulation set of laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| It is a police powers ordinance, but it is also considered to be a land use regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| We have two different ordinances that regulate sexually oriented businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| And in most jurisdictions, the sexually oriented business regulation is part of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5452)|
| 1:30:59| In ours, we did not do it that way, but we did send it through MPC for consideration because it was considered land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5459)|
| 1:31:07| But it has elements of police power ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| So it's a unique feature in Knoxville's ordinance, but typically it is a zoning ordinance in other jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5471)|
| 1:31:20| and has been upheld throughout the country as a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| I was wondering two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| One, it looks like we have put, even in funeral establishments, this is a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| and so my original question earlier in the courtyard is there will still be some notice and opportunity to participate to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5497)|
| 1:31:46| Ms. Davis' question vis-a-vis that use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| Or Mr. Donaldson, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| For any new funeral establishment, that would be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| About the existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| The existing funeral establishments would be not subject to the use permitted on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5522)|
| 1:32:10| for any expansions or interior modifications or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5530)|
| 1:32:17| This goes back to that general state law that the billboard people put in place that said once I got it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| I can fix it, change it, grow it, and all that other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| It's grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| Pretty much, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| Under the general heading of grandfathering, yeah, you're subject to those regulations that were in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| when you were established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| We've got to get a good lobbyist in Nashville to exclude this, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| We're going to have what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| A deferral if five council members agree at the council meeting so that the additional language will come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| Or will we have it by Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| I mean, that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| You have to actually publicize the new language, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| No, I mean, we'll have to get with Mr. Donaldson, and they'll have to have it at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| Well, council connects first and then send it back to MPC as a finished product, can't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| I mean, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| You can pass it as your ordinance and then ask them to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| It's either or, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| You certainly could draft it, but you cannot act on it until there's a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| and that may be the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Is there any other business to come before us this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| If not, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130228?start=5613)|
