| 2:25:55| and we're going to single out one type of offense, someone whom you have political disagreements with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8755)|
| 2:26:02| someone of a party that you have political disagreements with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8762)|
| 2:26:06| we're going to single it out and we're going to pass an action that affects one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8766)|
| 2:26:11| that says they can never, ever serve in Knox County government again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| yet at the same time allow people who are convicted for selling drugs to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8775)|
| 2:26:23| I think it's hypocritical, and I think that we need to look at this for what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| It is a shameless publicity stunt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| and I think we need to vote this down and throw it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| and I think we need to quit bringing stuff like this to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8795)|
| 2:26:39| Mr. Lambert, I would agree that it's a shameless publicity stunt on your part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:43| and that you are the one who is making this about one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:48| I would like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| So tell me, Ms. Boyles, who else does this apply to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| I figured it was going to get out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| I'm finished, but I'm saying that if this is not about one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8820)|
| 2:27:03| then I challenge Ms. Boyles to tell me who else this applies to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| Commissioner Fondas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| While I agree with the sense of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| will this affect any one person on any of our commissions right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8836)|
| 2:27:22| No, this does not affect anyone who is currently serving on any board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8842)|
| 2:27:27| If this is about the future of Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| are we going to continue to move it forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| and make it a respectable government again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| or are we going to continue to operate by the old boy network?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| I think Amy may have answered one of the questions I had about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| and this came up in the Finance Committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| which Commissioner Shouse brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| I do have a problem with an ex post facto, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| passing a law that affects something that someone did before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| and I think we've made it clear this does not apply to an ex-commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8882)|
| 2:28:06| This would have nothing to do with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| If for some reason this commission decided to remove him from the board that he sits on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| then we would have to do it through the public process that the law director just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| And if we pass this, it has nothing to do with him, you know, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8896)|
| 2:28:22| I think there are some reasons to have this and to counter maybe some of what Lumpy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| and I think he had some points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| But there's a difference when you commit an offense when you're not in office, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8910)|
| 2:28:36| particularly if you were young or something that's not related to the time you're serving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| rather than someone who has a breach of the public trust to the point where he's ousted from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8920)|
| 2:28:48| To me, that's pretty serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| And I think that those people who have demonstrated that they can't be trusted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8930)|
| 2:28:56| they should not be allowed to serve on boards, either now or in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8936)|
| 2:29:01| because of what they did in their office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| That's one of the reasons that I would support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| And I think that Commissioner Pinkston makes a point, well, if we want to remove them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| if the commission wanted to remove them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| they could go through that process that the law director mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| is where you could tell the person to have a public hearing and then vote to remove them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| The problem with that is that we don't know what the commission is going to be four years, six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8959)|
| 2:29:25| or 20 years from now, and you could very well have a commission that's been politically manipulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:31| to the point where they would not remove someone from a committee that needs to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| And this ordinance or this resolution would take care of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| and it would not allow someone that has had such an egregious breach of the public trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| that he has to be removed from office from continuing to sit on other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| And I think that removes some of the politics from it if we have this ordinance on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8988)|
| 2:29:55| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| Although I agree with some of your sentiment, Commissioner Burroughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9000)|
| 2:30:06| what Commissioner Brake said, we may be talking about commissioners 10, 20 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9006)|
| 2:30:16| I don't feel like this commission needs to tie their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| They wish to appoint someone or not appoint someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| That's their decision at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| And if it's been so politically, I forget the word Commissioner Brake just used, but twisted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9026)|
| 2:30:34| or that they want to appoint someone that most of us may find a disliking to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9034)|
| 2:30:42| they can simply vote to do away with the resolution with a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:47| And so I just don't think we need to be telling future commissioners what they have to do or not do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9047)|
| 2:30:58| because they've been elected and they'll make the decision on their own who they feel is best at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9058)|
| 2:31:06| And if it's an ousted commissioner and they want to vote for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:10| but then they're the ones that are going to have to face the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9070)|
| 2:31:13| That's the way I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| And if they made a bad decision on an appointment, then they'll feel the wrath of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| There's no reason for us to tell them how to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| Ms. Burroughs, I don't think there's anyone on this commission that does not share your view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| that we need to clean up government and make sure that it is clean government down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| I guess I would go along with Commissioner Luthold in that if, indeed, we do have a commission in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9096)|
| 2:31:41| that is politically manipulated or corrupt, they could very easily just rescind this resolution and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9101)|
| 2:31:49| hey, we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9109)|
| 2:31:50| It would be very easy for them to do if, indeed, they've gotten to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| Hopefully our citizens are not going to let that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| But as I understand it right now, we as a commission, from what I understand from the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9116)|
| 2:32:01| any board that we appoint, anyone appointed to a commission board or advisory board, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9121)|
| 2:32:08| we can remove them for any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| It doesn't have to be whether they were ousted from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| Maybe we don't like the fact they got a tattoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9132)|
| 2:32:15| Maybe we just don't like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9135)|
| 2:32:16| I mean, we can bring forth a resolution, and they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| Now, if it is a state situation like BZA, as our law director said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| any commissioner can bring forward a resolution to remove that individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| and we go through a hearing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| It seems to me we have this in place already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| I mean, I don't know why we would need to specifically have a resolution about ousted commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9153)|
| 2:32:38| because if someone objects to someone being on a board, we can remove them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9158)|
| 2:32:44| I mean, we could rescind the vote and remove them today, but if it's a state situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9164)|
| 2:32:48| then there's some due process that we have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| So this is not going to apply to state anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| So I guess I'm just kind of in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| Maybe you can help me why we really need this if we already have the tools in our toolbox anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| Because this does depoliticize that process that you were discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9182)|
| 2:33:09| But if you wanted to remove someone, you could bring a resolution today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| I mean, we wouldn't have to have a, quote, resolution just for an ousted commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| We can remove people for any reason, as I understand it, if we just don't like them or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9195)|
| 2:33:20| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9200)|
| 2:33:21| And that does create a politicized situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9201)|
| 2:33:24| This would do away with the possibility of that when you talk about a corrupt commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9204)|
| 2:33:30| And it's not been that long ago, guys, that we've had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9210)|
| 2:33:36| It doesn't do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9216)|
| 2:33:39| It certainly does a lot to prevent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| All they've got to do is pass another resolution, resolving that resolution, and they can do what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9221)|
| 2:33:46| We can't control what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| Commissioner Burroughs has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| No, we can't control what commissions 20 years from now are going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| I imagine they're going to undo a lot of things that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9236)|
| 2:33:59| All the time we pass resolutions that reach far into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9239)|
| 2:34:05| So if the reason for not passing this one is because, hey, it might be undone someday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9245)|
| 2:34:11| then let's apply that to every other resolution we're going to pass that reaches far into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9251)|
| 2:34:21| That's not business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9261)|
| 2:34:22| Commissioner, you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9264)|
| 2:34:25| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| I think just to answer Commissioner Hammond, and it's really sort of what Amy has said, too, is, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9269)|
| 2:34:36| the commission can do that, but the problem is, is that they may not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9276)|
| 2:34:41| And if you, you know, there's always been the issues of cronyism within the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:47| and if you have, there's a very, very high standard to oust someone from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| It's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| But if someone has breached that high bar that we set and it's been so egregious that they have been removed from office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9294)|
| 2:35:03| I think they probably shouldn't continue to serve because there can be pressure that can be put on through whatever factions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| there that would allow someone that has done some very bad things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9309)|
| 2:35:16| so bad they had to be removed from office to continue to serve in the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| And I think that's the argument that I would make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| Yeah, could they do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9322)|
| 2:35:23| But sometimes if the cronyism, if the protection of someone who has committed a very egregious breach of the public trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9323)|
| 2:35:32| if the commission has to go that extra step to rescind a resolution so this, and I'm going to use this term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9332)|
| 2:35:38| I don't mean it this way, this crook can continue to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| it really brings the public's attention that maybe something's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:51| Commissioner Ivan Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| I think everybody here knows how they're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9355)|
| 2:35:59| I've been waiting patiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9359)|
| 2:36:02| I didn't hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9362)|
| 2:36:03| Commissioner Mark Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| I heard a second somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| I just want everyone on this vote to think of this not in terms of some abstraction in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9370)|
| 2:36:17| what could or could not be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| Yes, bodies can change policy all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| Yes, unusual circumstances can arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| But as Commissioner Briggs has pointed out, ouster is a very high and serious bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9387)|
| 2:36:33| and why don't we simply view this item before us today as a statement of principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| that our noblest intent, that our principle taking us forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9398)|
| 2:36:44| is that persons who have met that high standard of ouster should not be on boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| and committees represented by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| If we approach it just as that noblest statement of principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| I think we can agree that it is us at our best behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| It is the better angels of our nature, and it is something we should pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9419)|
| 2:37:09| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| I have one for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| Does it mean a commissioner at this point in time immediately will have to be taken off a board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9433)|
| 2:37:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9442)|
| 2:37:23| It's my understanding the intent is prospective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| And, again, if you're talking about the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9446)|
| 2:37:28| It's in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9448)|
| 2:37:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9449)|
| 2:37:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9450)|
| 2:37:31| And if you're talking about, again, a board that is created by state statute like a BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| that requires a basically administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| You have to essentially prefer written charges against the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9460)|
| 2:37:44| and then afford them the opportunity of a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| Non-state boards, you pass a resolution outlining what you feel is the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9467)|
| 2:37:52| For instance, non-attendance at meetings, inappropriate conduct, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9472)|
| 2:37:57| In the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9477)|
| 2:38:00| Well, in terms of this resolution pertaining to an ousted official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9480)|
| 2:38:05| I believe the intent is for future issues, not to go after a current sitting member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9485)|
| 2:38:12| That's my understanding of the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9492)|
| 2:38:15| Mr. Chairman, I guess we'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| Yeah, we have that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100222part1?start=9497)|
