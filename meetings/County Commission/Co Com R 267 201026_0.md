| 0:07:03| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| I want to welcome everybody in attendance and those watching at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Commissioner Beeler, would you please lead us in the devotional tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, too, for the opportunity to share the devotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| at a time that we're facing right now with such a monumental election going on right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| now in our country, and at a time when, honestly, we're seeing our constitutional republic at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| work every time we come into this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| I've been on commission for almost two years and worked in this building for 31 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| and I've never seen the level of public involvement and input that we've had over the past couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| months with the proceedings of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| And so I was led, really, to the 13th chapter of Romans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| I actually taught this to some of the guys I disciple a few months ago, and I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| to share the first two verses and just a few thoughts about that very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| In Romans 13, Paul writes in the first two verses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| by God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Therefore, whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| resist will bring judgment on themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| And I'll be very honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Verse two has always been a very challenging verse for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| I know it's in the word of God, and I'm a Christian, and I believe the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| You know, it's right there in print in Romans 13, too, that those who resist the governing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| authorities will fall under judgment, but there's something else that's also in print,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| and it says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| So how do we balance a command from Scripture that says whoever resists the authority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| the government resists the authority of God in a nation that was founded on the very principle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| of revolution and where we are given the express right to petition the government for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| a redress of grievances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| We understand if we're governed by the divine right of kings, then we're not to resist the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| king's authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| But we live in a nation founded on the principle that we do not recognize the divine right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| of kings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| We are governed by the rule of law, and laws are to be made in this country only by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| people or their elected representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| That's the essence of a constitutional republic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| So what is unique, I think, in the way these verses apply to us as Americans is not that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| we are exempt from them, but that they actually hold us to an even higher standard than those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| to whom they were originally written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| We bear in America the responsibility of both citizens and government, and when we agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=589)|
| 0:09:57| as well as when we may disagree passionately, it is a responsibility that I'm honored to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| with each of you as a citizen and as a representative and as a follower of Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| So I'd invite you to join me in a word of prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| Father, thank you for the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| Thank you for your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Your word will stand forever, and it is settled in heaven, and I pray that it would be settled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| on earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Help us, Father, to have discernment, wisdom, and compassion as we perhaps make policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=624)|
| 0:10:33| interpret policies, and apply policies for the good of our community and the people and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| for your glory and honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| And we ask this in Jesus' name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Would everyone please rise and face our nation's flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=660)|
| 0:11:11| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| A little bit about our meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Unless I hear objections from my colleagues, here is how I intend on conducting tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| I do want to actually just do one little notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Per the schedule, all agenda items for November are due this Wednesday, October 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| We have a short month with the Thanksgiving holiday, so all agenda items need to be in by this Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| Here's the run of show for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| First, we're going to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Then we'll hear items number 46 and 47, honoring those who have given significant service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| After that, we're going to hear a short presentation from our partners at Rural Metro and the Friends of Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| We will then continue with public forum that will last one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| I have an exorbitant number of people on our list, so I'm going to give priority to those who have not spoken to us before, and our Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=715)|
| 0:12:04| Following that, we will move on to the business of Knox County, as outlined in our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| This meeting will go into recess a few minutes before 7 o'clock with a quick break, and then we will do our zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| After zonings, we'll continue with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| At the end of the meeting, we will have a second opportunity for public forum, which will also last for one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| Commissioner Smith, did you have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| I'm just wondering, one and two, are we going to move that forward also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| Yeah, those are going to be read but not presented tonight, so we will approve those and read them, but we won't do presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| Those are going to be done personally by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Yeah, I didn't know if they were here or not, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Everybody clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Yeah, motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Well, I need to tell you what the additions, withdrawals, deferrals, and non-consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| I just wanted to give you the kind of run of the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| So if everybody's good with the run of the evening, and I'm seeing no objections, I'm going to move forward to setting the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| Additions to the agenda include, get your pens ready, 184449 and Resolution R-2010-803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=789)|
| 0:13:22| That was given to you separately from the Finance or Procurement Department, or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| I can't remember which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Is that Finance or Procurement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| So additions are 184449 and Resolution 20-10-803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| Withdrawals include number 38, 38 on withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Deferrals include 29, 34, 27, 28, and 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| Once again, deferrals include 29, 34, 27, 28, and 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=832)|
| 0:14:00| And then non-consent items are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 26, 27, and 28, 35, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, and 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=840)|

| 0:15:50| I graduated the University of Tennessee with honors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| I graduated the University of Tennessee with honors, and that's something I'm very proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| The lowest grade I received was a C+, and that was in public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| Isn't it ironic that I now am an elected official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| But I've always been wise enough to know to surround myself with those that are strong in areas where I'm weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| And for that reason, I have brought in someone to read Commissioner Anders' proclamation, who can really provide the justice it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=977)|

| 0:16:31| Sir, would you please read the proclamation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| When Commissioner Smith asked me to do this, I was happy to do it because Brad Anders read my proclamation as I was leaving commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| So when he asked, I said I would be more than happy to come and read the resolution, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1006)|

| 0:20:19| And, sir, if there's anything you'd like to say, please do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| I would, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1222)|

| 0:20:33| I have thoroughly, my whole life has been public service, 27 years in law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| and now still in public service at Knox County Emergency Communications District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| But it's been one of the best honors and the most fun, although most stressful, times of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| I've been sitting right there where you guys are sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| It's tough when families are friends and neighbors until somebody wants to rezone next to them or something changes in their world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1253)|
| 0:21:04| It's emotional. It's an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| It's very tough to sit there and make those decisions, and I appreciate you guys for being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| I really would be remiss if I didn't speak, you know, I served with three mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| and Mayor Ragsdale for two years, Mayor Burchett for eight, and Mayor Jacobs for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1278)|

| 0:21:26| you can't operate a county without a tremendous amount of work and support from the county workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| The department heads, as a commissioner, I was never turned away as far as an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| They didn't always agree with me, and we didn't always get things done exactly the time and the speed and the way we wanted to get them done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| But every one of them worked very hard, the county employees, the county directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| It makes your all's job much easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| But I want to thank them for their continued support of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| There's a lot of work gets done for a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Although it's a billion-dollar budget, a tremendous amount of work gets done through all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| So thank you, guys. I appreciate the honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| And it has been an honor to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| My phone literally is never off now, so if you need me, call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1335)|
| 0:22:24| Mr. Chair, could I take a moment of personal privilege?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1344)|

| 0:28:32| He's back there videoing you, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1712)|

| 0:28:46| I was fortunate enough to actually serve under three different mayors that we've had in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1726)|
| 0:28:54| and every day is a challenge, and people, until you've sat up there or you've ever run for a campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1734)|
| 0:29:02| you have no idea really what you go through, but more so your family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| and that's why my Emma Grace is heartbroken she could not be here to say hello to all of you all today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1747)|
| 0:29:16| but I promised her as soon as things settle out in Knox County, she will be up here to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1756)|

| 0:29:33| and public service has always been at my heart, and I was fortunate to be born and raised that way by two great parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1773)|
| 0:29:42| that instilled in us as long as you have breath on this earth, we are to be serving and doing for other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1782)|

| 0:30:05| and I hate to really bring up, and he knows where I'm going on this, but you know Courtney is a former Bobcat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1805)|

| 0:30:23| I did not get a text from Commissioner Daley that night, so I took the upper road and decided I would wait until today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| until we could be in public on that. So I do appreciate all of you. I pray for all of y'all's families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1831)|

| 0:30:49| and even though we can't please everybody at the same time, I know everybody's heart is to want to do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1849)|
| 0:30:58| and the best thing for everybody in their district, and so love Carson. I love you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1858)|

| 0:31:25| is that Knox County is the best place to live and raise our families and to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1885)|

| 0:32:40| Thank you, Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I have the honor and privilege of presenting tonight's proclamation in honor of Hugh Nystrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| former county commissioner and immediate past chair of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| I remember specifically the day that Mr. Nystrom, wherever he is, he's coming right here, called me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1974)|
| 0:33:03| I'm thinking about running for commission. I'd like to come sit down and talk to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| and we had a great conversation about public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| We had a great conversation about why to run, why not to run, all the craziness that goes along with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| but the thing that I'll always remember was there wasn't a hesitation for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| and I've known Hugh a long, long time, and no matter what it is, whether it's his work with child advocacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| or his work in customer service or his neighborhood and community, there's always one person who steps up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| and he's always kind of the silent guy who just shows up, and he never makes a big deal out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| He always does the work, and he always takes it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| So it's my honor today to present this proclamation and a gift and give the mic to our good friend Hugh Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2024)|
| 0:33:54| Whereas Hugh Nystrom's term as Knox County Commissioner, representing the people of the 4th Commission District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| expired August 31, 2020, and whereas Commissioner Hugh Nystrom was elected to the Knox County Commission in 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| to serve as a four-year term, and whereas in 2018 and again in 2019 Commissioner Hugh Nystrom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| was elected by his colleagues to serve in the leadership role of chair of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2052)|

| 0:34:22| and impartial manner and set an example of civility, and whereas Commissioner Hugh Nystrom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| ably served on numerous boards and committees while on the commission, including more recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| Insolvency Board, Retirement and Pension Board, Agricultural Extension Committee, and the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| and whereby Hugh Nystrom had the worst puns and jokes of all commissioners of all time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| but is not written in this proclamation, but I just had to write that in quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| but Commissioner Hugh Nystrom's thoughtful insight, courteous demeanor, and knowledge of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| government operations will be sorely missed by commission, and whereas the commission wishes to join| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2093)|

| 0:35:02| now therefore be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| The commission of Knox County hereby honors Hugh Nystrom for his years of exemplary service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2105)|

| 0:35:22| Thank you, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2122)|
| 0:35:35| Well, goodness. You know, being here in this moment, it kind of reminds me of being a grape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| and you know what the grape said after he got stepped on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| He didn't say anything. He just let out a little whine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| But I probably wouldn't have said that had it not been for Larson making that reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2150)|
| 0:35:58| You know, most importantly, when I look at this audience, I see a whole bunch of friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| and I've got a bunch of old friends and a bunch of new friends and so many dear people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2163)|
| 0:36:11| that I've come to know over these years of public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| and I want to say this on the record and with conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Now, knowing all of my fellow commissioners, and as a former commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| each one of you I know has ran and is serving your constituents for the right reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2184)|

| 0:36:38| You know, I remember some wise words that Commissioner Daley and I once talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| when we were first beginning our terms together, and we agreed that you do your best to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| We sometimes can disagree on policies or procedures, but when we walk out of this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| it's back to being normal, and we're going to come to find ways to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| I once heard another mayor make a comment one time that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| you know, you may be opposed to something this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| but you may need your friend to work with you the next month on a particular item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| that might be for the good of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| And when I think about this resolution, the word that really means so much to me is that word civility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| and I've always tried to emulate someone I've admired so much, which is Senator Howard Baker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| and his work in civility in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| And to hear that word to describe me, who can't hold a candle to former Senator Baker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| I take that as quite a compliment, so I want to thank all of you for those kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| I want to thank all of my dear friends who I've made working here in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Between the frontline folks to the department heads to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| it's just been an absolute humble privilege to work with you and for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| Frankly, it's been a pleasure to have worked with Mayor Burchett, now Mayor Jacobs, over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| I told somebody, in a way it's like going and getting a master's degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| and now I'm going to kind of fade into just being more of a dad and a worker and a scout volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| but the most important person and persons that I want to thank are standing right over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| and that's my wife Angela and my son Trace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Some of you may have been there at Buddy's Barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| We once hosted a Star Wars birthday party for Trace when he was like four years old at Buddy's Barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| Do you remember that, Trace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Yeah, I think I did a Jedi training for you there that night, and then you hit somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| But if you all may remember, Trace actually was the one who introduced me and announced my campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| and said he wanted to introduce Hugh Nystrom, the next county commissioner for the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| and he was really little and it was cute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| But I most importantly want to thank Angela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| You can't do this without the support of a strong spouse who loves you unconditionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| and who allows you this kind of service because, as the words have been said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| there is a certain level of stress when you come home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| and Angela has definitely taken the load of helping keep Team Nystrom on the right tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| So as we move forward, continue to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| Continue to do your best in your judgment to make our county a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| I'm rooting for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| I might not be watching it on the Internet tonight, but know that my heart is with all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| and I know all of you, each of you, is doing your best to do the right thing for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| and continue to make it better to help jobs, schools, education, everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| It's all so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| So anyhow, I bid you farewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| You can always call me if you need a bad joke, and have a good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2381)|
| 0:39:50| Mayor Jacobs, I'd like to invite you to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| You have some members of our community that are receiving some special recognition, and you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2392)|
| 0:40:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| I'm being joined by Mr. Ed Bolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| On August 31st, Mr. Bolling, who plays in our adult softball league, collapsed during a game at the sports park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2414)|
| 0:40:23| He wasn't breathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Several individuals rushed to his aid, and some other folks grabbed an AED device and came over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| To make a long story short, through quick thinking, teamwork, combination of chest compressions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| and the use of the AED, they resuscitated Mr. Bolling, who was taken to the hospital by an ambulance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| and underwent several procedures, but as you can see, is doing very well today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| So I would like to recognize those six individuals for their life-saving action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| as well as thank the Karnes Fire Department and AMR, who provide training for our employees on the use of an AED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2453)|
| 0:41:03| Mr. Bolling, would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Are you going to introduce the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Yes, I'll bring them down after the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| Well, thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| As I feel, I'm such a blessed man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| I have so much gratitude to all the people that helped me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| Again, I've got a great support system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| I brought my wife, Charlotte, of going on 53 years, and she'll say 106,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2484)|
| 0:41:32| but I want to introduce her, and my daughter, Wendy, is back here, and my youngest granddaughter, Addison, is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2492)|
| 0:41:42| and my son, Greg, is right behind us over here, and my daughter-in-law, Martha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| So that's my support system in my family, but I want to publicly thank Jennifer Gentry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2509)|
| 0:41:58| who the mayor will introduce here in just a minute, but on having the foresight to see on getting the AED there on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2518)|
| 0:42:10| Of course, my wife was my first guardian angel three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| We had another little uh-oh in Tampa, and I was playing softball there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| Actually, softball has actually saved my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| Well, and then Nekosha Scott, which Nekosha took the lead in the CPR and also using the AED the way it's supposed to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2542)|
| 0:42:35| but not only have people step up and perform the knowledge that they have, and some people will be bystanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2555)|
| 0:42:45| but these folks that the mayor is going to introduce stepped up, and I'm so fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| I'm so blessed. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| If we could do this individually, I have proclamations for Nekosha Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2575)|
| 0:43:06| Would you please come on down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2586)|
| 0:43:19| Mr. Bowen, get on over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| I don't want to stand beside you, Mayor, if I see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2611)|
| 0:43:41| Alexis Flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Alexis, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2623)|
| 0:44:08| Dan Meyer, Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2648)|
| 0:44:25| Jennifer Gentry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2665)|
| 0:44:44| We actually at Knox County Parks and Recreation got a little present for Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| These are the pads that we actually used on him that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2689)|
| 0:45:03| These old men that play on the senior league, they're my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| I love them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| We have seven 60-and-over teams that play on Monday night, and we have three teams of 70-and-over men that play on Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2709)|
| 0:45:17| So I encourage you all to come out and watch them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| They have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| If we're not in a supine position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| Dan Daremore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Dan, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2736)|
| 0:45:46| This is my teammate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2746)|
| 0:46:02| Justin Conley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| We actually have the owner of the Zoll company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2769)|
| 0:46:18| And one more thing, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| We have the owner of the Zoll company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| I believe they're actually the manufacturer of the AEDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| Would you like to say a word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| So on behalf of AED Brands and Zoll Medical, we just want to commend Knox County for having the vision to implement a life-saving AED program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2796)|
| 0:46:47| and the foresight to be able to implement a program, to maintain the program, to make sure that it works when it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2807)|
| 0:46:56| And, Mr. Ed, it sure was needed that day, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Absolutely, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| But we just want to commend the selfless action of all the responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| You know, it's said that it takes a village to raise a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| Well, you could also say it takes a village to save a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| And that day, so many people were involved in saving Mr. Ed's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| So Mr. Ed is going to donate an AED to the Parks and Rec Department to honor those responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2839)|
| 0:47:30| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| Could you just give us your name for the record, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Yes, sir. My name is Keith Hildebrandt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Thank you, sir. Congratulations, and thank you for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| I appreciate the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2868)|
| 0:48:00| Madam Clerk, if you would please read items number one and two into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| Again, Commissioner Ward is going to offer those proclamations personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Do we need to make a motion for 46 and 47?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| Not 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| We already approved those in previous meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| They were just moved to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Yes, sir. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=2905)|

| 0:53:01| kind of give you a clue of how many calls we run, what kinds of calls we run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| what we actually are doing out in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3186)|

| 0:53:29| medical first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3209)|

| 0:53:35| 108 car crashes, 20 residential structure fires, five of which were of cooking or kitchen nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3215)|

| 0:53:58| Six commercial structure fires, two hazardous materials calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3238)|

| 0:54:54| That's a new thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3294)|

| 0:55:15| And with approximately 65 contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3315)|

| 0:57:29| Yeah, let me do that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| I'm not that smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Thank you, sir, for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| You serve everyone in the district in the coverage areas you provide, yet we only have a 50 percent enrollment rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3459)|
| 0:57:48| How do we get the message out that everybody's rate could conceivably be lower if more people participated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| And I know you have the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| If they have a call, a fire, and you go out, then you have to charge them an exuberant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3478)|
| 0:58:07| What can we do to better educate people that it's actually in their benefit, your benefit, and their neighbor's benefit to enroll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3487)|
| 0:58:17| I know there's supposed to be, on your insurance, there's supposed to be a higher charge if they don't prove they are a member of a fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3497)|
| 0:58:27| But the insurance industry seems to just not want to bother to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| Can you please give us some tips on what we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| Well, first on the tips, let me tell you that the mayor and our fire chief, Chief Arnish, have been working on some resolutions that might help that from a county governing body standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3514)|
| 0:58:46| I don't want to rain on anybody's parade with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| But, yes, you're right, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| The problem is that you get a, by law, you're supposed to get a lower insurance premium if you are a subscriber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3532)|
| 0:59:00| The problem is the insurance companies don't play by those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| Representative Zachary has been our champion in Nashville to try to lead that charge through Commerce and Insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3543)|
| 0:59:10| But we've not found a real favorable audience down there with Commerce and Insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| But because of what's happened in 2020, we haven't been able to get in front of folks in Nashville to try to make that stick a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3557)|
| 0:59:25| But the biggest thing is the word of mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| And I will tell anybody publicly, loudly from the hilltops that if everybody would subscribe, the rates would drop astronomically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3568)|
| 0:59:35| And that's the same for us as it is for Carnes, which is another subscription department in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| So if everybody subscribed, if everybody partnered together, it's much, much better, much cheaper for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3581)|
| 0:59:51| Thank you, Mr. Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Thank you for your service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| And we appreciate your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| We're going to move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| We're going to run public forum from 5.55 to 6.55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| We are going to take a break, and then we will start zoning just a few minutes after 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3604)|
| 1:00:14| As I said at the beginning of the meeting, we have a lot of people on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| I've given priority to those who have not spoken to us before or are Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| I'm going to go through the list of the first few, if you'll just make yourself known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| If you are downstairs, there is a podium for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| If you are upstairs, there is also a podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| Is Frank Luthold here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| Mr. Luthold, if you'd make yourself known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| I did not see him come in, so I'm going to skip there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| So on the list currently, I'm going to give you the first couple of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| First is going to be Gary Humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| Are you with us, Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| If you'll make your way to the podium, after Gary will be Laura Branson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| Are you with us, Laura?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Then Dr. Stephen Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| Dr. Smith, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| And then Deborah Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| Is Deborah Howard here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| First up to the podium is going to be Mr. Gary Humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| If you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| I don't see Gary Humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Commissioner Jay, in order to save everyone some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| I have five members who are willing to give up our collective 25 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| in order for Gary Humble to have 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| That way we can save everybody some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| You've already heard from all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Well, it depends on where you are on the list, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Well, my name is Elizabeth Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| I was first on the list before you changed the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| and began to only allow those to speak first who had never spoken before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| If Laura Branson would like to give up her time, she is second on the list tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| If she would like to give up her time, then he could have 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| So you're not willing to let five people volunteer to step off the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| Because your rules, by the way, sir, don't permit you to limit public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| Sir, I'm going through the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Your rules don't allow you to limit public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| So we're going to be here tonight, and we're going to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| We'll speak at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| So if you'd like, we can get rid of five speakers so that you can save some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| What I'm going to do is invite Gary Humble to join us for five minutes at the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| and I'm going to go over the list in the order I just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| Mr. Humble, please state your name and address for the record, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| My name is Gary Humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| I live in Williamson County, 625 Baker's Bridge in Franklin, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| Sir, I'm going to ask priority is for Knox County residents first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3756)|
| 1:02:43| However, you've already acknowledged it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Why not let us go ahead and finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| This is Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| This is not Williamson County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| I'm a Knox County citizen, and I'd be happy to give them my five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3771)|
| 1:02:58| Please, please stop, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| This is not how we run a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| Mr. Humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Changing the rules of the game after the game started is not proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| You can talk louder than the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| Okay, let's go downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Mr. Humble, I will give you five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| If anyone else is not a Knox County resident, I'm going to ask each time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| and I'm going to move you to the bottom of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| This is Knox County Commission, and I'm going to give Knox County residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| who are taxpaying residents in this community priority first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| and I'm going to go by the list that I have and those who have not given us an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| I'm going to make one exception for Mr. Humble, because I did recognize him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| because he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| So if you would, please, sir, give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Yes, sir, Gary Humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| I will go to the list after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| 625 Bakers Bridge Avenue, Franklin, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| And I appreciate the opportunity, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| I'm here to address the county commissioners here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| really on behalf of the citizens of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| because you are in a very unique position in a unique moment in history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| to not only uphold and defend the constitutional liberties of your constituents here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3847)|
| 1:04:14| but make a statement on the constitutional liberties of the citizens of our entire state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| Before COVID, no one would have imagined to interpret our state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| with the idea that a locally appointed unelected board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| would have unbridled authority to make law and pass policy, including having civil penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3869)|
| 1:04:37| So I want an opportunity just for a moment to retrain our thinking a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| Separation of powers is incredibly crucial in our constitutional republic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| and that separation of powers is not only extended to us by the United States Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| but further secured by Article 2, Section 2 of the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| And there are several issues that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| If I could have the commissioner's attention, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| In Article 2, Section 2 of our Constitution, we have a very strict separation of powers clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| We've currently filed as citizens of the state of Tennessee a lawsuit against Governor Bill Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| for the unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| and the unlawful delegation of his power to counties, county mayors, and boards of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| to issue things such as mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| But recently, I'll bring up a case that I hope you are aware of in Michigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| Of course, different state, different state constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| but they have a similar article in their constitution, which says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| The powers of government are divided into three branches, legislative, executive, and judicial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| That has made it to the Michigan Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| and they have ruled that the delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch in their state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| is unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Similarly, we have an article in Tennessee, Article 2, Section 2, that says no person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| or persons belonging to one of these departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| shall exercise any of the powers properly belonging to either of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| That means members of the legislative branch can't do the governor's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| The governor can't do the legislature's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| It also means that an unelected appointed executive body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| cannot do the job of policymaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| So it's wonderful that the state at some point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| decided to delegate its lawmaking authority to an unelected county board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| The simple fact is it does not have the constitutional authority to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| You men and women, as county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| have been elected by your constituents of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| By all means, you certainly have some duty to provide for the safety of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| But you swore an oath, so help you God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| to uphold and defend the constitution of this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| and the constitution of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| You have a sworn oath and a sworn duty to first, before you do anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4031)|
| 1:07:18| secure the constitutional liberties of your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| One way that you can do that is to dissolve an unconstitutional body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| called the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Their proper role is to advise you and to advise executives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| and to advise the legislature on health matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| not to make policy, not to deem workers essential and or not essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| not to issue mask mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| and not to deprive the public of their liberty under civil penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| Your decision to potentially do that tonight and uphold the constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| not only upholds the liberty of the constituents of your county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| but sends a signal to the little tyrants across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| and across the nation that we here in the Volunteer State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| as Tennesseans, choose to uphold our personal liberties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| and as our lesser magistrates here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| you have the power and the ability and the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| to stop tyranny at the borders of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| by dissolving an unconstitutional Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| Thank you for your time. I relinquish the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4111)|
| 1:08:38| Laura Branson, can I ask if you are a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| I am. I live in Hardin Valley, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| If you would please state your name and address for the record. You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| Laura Branson, Hardin Valley, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Shut up and wear the damn mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| I have heard this phrase repeated over and over in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| on multiple news platforms, on radio interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| I have seen it written on numerous forms of social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| as a way to shame and manipulate dissidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| from what has become a ritualistic form of submission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| to a transhumanistic dystopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| Just shut up and wear the damn mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| First of all, I know there are people in this room who can spout off studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| that show mask wearing can be somewhat effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| to slow the spread of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| On the other hand, I could stand here and spout off studies that prove otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| I have been to two of the last three of these public forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| and I think the only thing, as one gentleman pointed out a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| is that the science behind the masks proves it only contradicts itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| There is no right side to the argument versus a wrong side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| in the subject of mask efficacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| I will not stand here and say that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| that the actual COVID-19 virus is nothing to be concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| I realize many people have become seriously ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| and some people have even passed away because of the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| My heart does go out to those individuals and to their loved ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| just as my heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| to fatal car accidents, accidental overdoses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| other incurable health complications, and many other causes of death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| What makes dying from COVID-19 any different than dying any other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| Yes, it spreads from human to human, but so does the common cold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| so does the flu, so does pneumonia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| People get sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| It has been like that for as long as we can tell. It happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| Putting that aside, I feel there is a much broader scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| of a human crisis going on under the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| Over the past eight months, I have watched our society and our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| fall victim to what feels like an added chapter of George Orwell's 1984.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| This so-called coronavirus crisis has been a manufactured occult ritual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| from start to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| The United States was founded upon free will and free agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| These elements are God-given, as every person here on this earth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| chose by free agency between the maker of good versus the maker of evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| I have heard several of you commissioners admit in this very room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| that this mask mandate has caused a massive divide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| in the good people of this county, and yes, it absolutely has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| I refuse to believe that healthy people, especially healthy children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| should be forced to wear a mask for prolonged periods of time every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| Again, that science behind it is inconclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| I do believe, however, that this forced ritualistic suppression of ego| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| and emotion is destroying us as human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| It is ripping apart the very threads of what makes us humanly aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| of relation to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| How on earth does it feel okay for any of you to walk around a public gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| without facial association because we are all hiding behind a mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| What is being done to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| I will repeat it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| There is no conclusive science that proves masks are effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| So what is really going on here, and why is an unelected board of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| allowed to force this upon an entire population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| with no answer to an end of it in sight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| Our country is currently under attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4330)|

| 1:12:19| and unfortunately many people cannot recognize they are being brainwashed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| into believing they are falling victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| We are hearing phrases such as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| it's for the greater good, or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4347)|

| 1:12:31| And my personal sickening favorite is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| we're all in this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4354)|

| 1:13:00| as a form of disguise or concealment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| usually worn over or in front of the face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4382)|

| 1:13:07| to establish another being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| Mask wearing represents an occult transformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| from one role to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4392)|

| 1:13:31| such as constantly being mouth masked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| one is suddenly demoted and reassigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4413)|

| 1:13:52| of any kind of people to allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4432)|

| 1:14:09| In closing, I will quote Benjamin Franklin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| when he said those who would give up essential liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4451)|

| 1:15:01| Unelected officials with unconstitutional mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| The other thing I want to bring up is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| we have a disease process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| that has never been proven to actually exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| No one in the world has isolated and purified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| a COVID-19 novel coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| It has never been proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| The foundational article in The Lancet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| the authors from China actually have stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| that they did not identify a whole intact virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| The PCR test being used to confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4534)|

| 1:15:51| and pandemic that no one has shown to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| The CDC data that was just released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| at the end of the third quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| shows 236,000 deaths per month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| deaths of all causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4567)|

| 1:16:13| We have less deaths this year in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| This does not support a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| What we have is a pandemic of false positive tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| from a PCR test that should be stopped immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| It is not a diagnostic test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4587)|

| 1:16:38| until he died last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| he said this should never be used for diagnostic purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| Anyone who continues to propagate the fake science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| and nonsensical mandates and measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| will be complicit with the destruction of our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| Without the mainstream media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| constantly talking about outbreaks and hot spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| would we act any differently this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| than we did last year or the year before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| The data suggests that we've had a typical flu season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| that has been propagated and pushed as a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| in order to gain tyranny and take away our liberties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| I'm going to shorten the rest of mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| since some of it's redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4639)|

| 1:17:54| Okay, I absolutely loathe public speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| but I am compelled to stand up for our rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| before it is too late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| both here and at the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| I've spoken there twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| The Knox County Board of Health must be dissolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| and Knox County should join the 80-plus other counties in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| which do not have a Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Their infringement on our rights are both abhorrent and terrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| Their power is out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| What we are witnessing is appalling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| When I hear the statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| the science is settled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| a chill goes down my spine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| Science by its very nature is never settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| Are you familiar with the scientific method?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| I know I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| My kids learned about it in school as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| To me, this is a tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| which says I am a totalitarian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| I will not debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| you will obey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| or there will be consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| You may be shunned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4739)|

| 1:19:08| You may be arrested, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| I have two children in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| They're in high school right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| They just want to stay in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| The tentacles of this Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| have reached into our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| both Knox County Schools and the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| and it's spreading out from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| My children may want to go to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| The mandatory testing they have right now at UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| is an infringement on those students' rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| It's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| None of this is normal in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| The Board of Health needs to be dissolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| and its unlawful mandates rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| I really want a better future for my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| and their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4794)|

| 1:20:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| My name is Kay Stroud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| I'm from the Powell area, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| You know, as a Southern girl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| you know when a Southern girl says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| you know when a Southern girl says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| what did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| It's not because she didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| It's because she's saying you better be right with Jesus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| because a whooping is a coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| I'm here today because someone from the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| tried to silence her voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| by sending a petty functionary out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| to cut the power to the stage at Market Square yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| Well, now you've poked the bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| My belief, it is my belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| that the Board of Health should be dissolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| If we want to bring them back as purely advisory position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| I think that would be prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| My personal story on why I think the Board of Health should go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| begins 35 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| when I began my career as a medical photographer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| Short version, if you don't know what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| we do clinical documentation, research publication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| and scientific journals and things for teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| My career spanned over three teaching hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| the VA in Durham, North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation in New Orleans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| and the University of Alabama, Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| Back then, I was that invisible functionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| that witnessed firsthand how these students and fellows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| were indoctrinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| They were taught that no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| you are the expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| You know best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| You will never admit you are wrong to a patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| You will not tarnish our image or reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| by admitting fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| This was beat into them on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| So what is the real agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Are we just one big social experiment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| to see how far you can push fear or make people comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| or ultimately is this to control our actions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| I do have two research documents with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| One is the Swiss Policy Research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| I think it's already been circulated before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| with 36 studies or examples of how masks don't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| The second refers to personality traits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| are associated with research misbehavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| in Dutch scientists, a cross-sectional study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| I'll be happy to give you all this information if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| There's a commonality trait that appears to run amok| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| through our Board of Health and those who influence the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| Machiavellianism, which is a big fancy word to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| that politics is amoral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| and that any means, however unscrupulous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| can justifiably be used in achieving political power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| I will tell you right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| if you were to give me the same power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| knowing there'd be no repercussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| no job loss or legal consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| I would be tempted to push those boundaries too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| I have an insatiable curiosity because I am human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| So I conclude by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| this is not simply about a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| May I have your attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| Continue, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| I respectfully ask this Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| use your critical thinking, your logic, common sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| and please make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| And please, please, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| stop insulting your citizens' intelligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| It's becoming tiresome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5046)|
| 1:24:14| Order of speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Kim Adamo, Susan Bryant, Nalaine Sutton, Marcy Yadon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| Kim Adamo, if you are here, please take the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| Are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| Marilyn Collins Way, 379.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| I'm working on the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| I can't stop the meeting because of the lighting, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Please, if you have a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| address it to the officer at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| and they'll bring it down to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| We can't stop the meeting for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| Would you like us to come downstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| Mr. Adamo, or Ms. Adamo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| if you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Marilyn Collins Way, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| I'm sorry, are you Ms. Adamo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| Yes, Kimberly Adamo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| Okay, sorry, I didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| I have been tuning in to what has been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| since the last mask mandate back in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| I have been listening carefully to each speaker and your responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| Quite frankly, I'm disgusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| It has been stated that thousands of emails have been received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| and that we know you have heard, but not listened to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| hundreds of your constituents right here in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| I had written all of you an email months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| about the discrimination my family has gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| and continues to go through like so many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| and yet it has never been addressed once by this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| or the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| Extremely harsh and borderline violent discrimination is going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| and it's being ignored time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| If the Board of Health was really about health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| they would have made it clear from the very beginning of the mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| that there are a vulnerable population in Knox County that needs support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| people who need understanding, love, and compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| but instead they are faced with cruelty, name-calling, and refusal of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| Why haven't the commissioners pressed upon the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| that they must make all businesses aware that people with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| or religious or other factors do not have to wear a mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| How is it possible that businesses are getting more and more intolerant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| to those who are the exception?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| On July 14th, we had our first experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| with the cruel and volatile behavior of a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| I remember this exact date because it was my daughter's 10th birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| She and I went into Nothing But A Cake to grab some treats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| to bring to the pool that afternoon to share with her friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| but instead she was screamed at, treated as if she was a leper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| and made to grasp onto my arm and sob uncontrollably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| while the store manager ran us out like a violent maniac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| You see, my 10-year-old daughter is vaccine injured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| resulting in sensory processing disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| She cannot wear a mask because it overstimulates her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| and causes a host of reactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| It is not safe nor healthy for her to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| But this store, like so many others, do not follow the guidelines for exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5242)|
| 1:27:28| There was no reason for my daughter to undergo such duress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| and I blame all of you for forever imprinting this assault on her birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5251)|
| 1:27:39| I keep hearing rhetoric about wearing masks until there is a vaccine ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| Well, this is an extremely ironic situation for me and my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| as we are forced to deal with not being able to wear a mask due to a vaccine injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| Others are waiting for a vaccine to take off their mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| It seems absurd that anyone would risk a vaccine injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| for a virus that has a 99% survival rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| Discrimination isn't only happening to my child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| This is happening to children every day, children who want to be in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| children who want to play sports, who want to dance, play volleyball, gymnastics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| children who want to attend music lessons, theater practice, chorus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| They are being discriminated against because the mandates are being falsely advertised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| as if there are no exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| Why is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| People who have a reason not to wear a mask are afraid to go to certain places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| because of the nasty, horrible climate you all have helped create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5324)|
| 1:28:51| Some of you are even responsible for the divide and for this fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| You have all taken a side, and the disrespect and the reasoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| at the end of the last meeting has brought me to this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| As if all of us do not have elderly parents or grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| or a loved one with an autoimmune disease like myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| using them as an excuse not to dissolve the board was heinous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| They could unfortunately die in a car accident today, a stroke tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| from the flu, pneumonia, just as they could of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| I moved here from New York State three years ago to get away from elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| who didn't listen to its constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| I know all about this way too well, this type of selfish, one-sided, agenda-driven focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| I lost my aunt to COVID in a New York nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| I am still grieving as she was forced to die alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| I bet if you ask any person who has lost a person to COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| if they were allowed to be with them, would they have been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| And they would answer yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| I am asking all of you today to dissolve the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| As a medical professional with a license, I do believe that there should be an advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5408)|

| 1:30:27| Susan Bryant, are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| If you would please state your name and address to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| My name is Susan Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| I'm at 4423 Aylesbury Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| First, thank you for your service as commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| and for your concern for all our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| The commission has heard from a number of citizens who are opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| to the Board of Health regulations regarding COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| particularly the mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| However, we are deeply concerned that the commissioners are hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| from a small but highly vocal minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| and that the majority of Knox County citizens both support such a mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| and are opposed to the commission's efforts to dilute the statutory power of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| What is being argued is that a mask mandate intrudes on individual freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| Yet, we have ordinances to require wearing a seatbelt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| prohibit driving over a certain speed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| ban smoking in public places and many others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| all of which serve to protect the health of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| So we ask you, is a mask mandate any different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| Our laws attempt to balance individual freedom and public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| The Knox County mask mandate is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| Yet, the commissioners, under pressure from some of their constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| wish to limit the authority of the health professionals on the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| not on the basis of scientific evidence, but rather on the basis of politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| Wearing a facial mask is not a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| It is a health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| And those of us who support the mask mandate do so because it protects our health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| from a deadly virus that is not going away anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| Please stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| If anything, the spread of the virus is getting worse, as the county's health data indicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| While we are all concerned about the many businesses that have been adversely affected by this virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| the way out of the crisis is not by ignoring it, but rather by trying to control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| Mask wearing has been proven to reduce the spread of the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| Were the commissioners to overrule the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| and make mask wearing voluntary rather than mandatory, we all know what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| Many more people would refuse to wear masks, and the virus would spread unchecked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| as it has in communities with no such mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| None of us like wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| But we do so because they protect our families, our friends, our neighbors, and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5588)|
| 1:33:15| It is not that difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| So let's leave these decisions in the hands of the professionals and not bow to pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| Please, let's let the Health Department and the Board of Health do their jobs to protect all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| so that we can finally see our way clear from this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| I submit to you the following 494 Knox County residents support this letter and counting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| and the authority of the Health Department and the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| We submit this letter and the list of supporters for the Knox County Commission meeting record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5626)|
| 1:33:52| We'll be happy to offer updates as more names are added to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| You can give it to the commission desk over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| I want to remind everybody that we're here to listen to everybody in a professional and courteous manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| We're not going to sneer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| We're not going to laugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| We're not going to everyone is afforded everyone else the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| You turn this into a circus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| We're going to stop telling for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| We're going to get on with their business, and everybody can go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| Please be respectful of your fellow citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| Nelaine Sutton, Marcy Yodon, and Andy Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| Nelaine Sutton, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5669)|

| 1:34:35| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5677)|

| 1:34:39| I live at 11901 West Fox Chase Circle in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| I'm a native Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| My family has run a business here for 120 years, since 1906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| We are classified as an essential business, and so we have flourished during this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| But I'm here to speak out for all the many businesses who have not flourished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| for the restaurant that I went to on Friday night who has struggled to stay in business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5703)|
| 1:35:10| because they've chosen to not require their patrons or their wait staff to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| I'm for medical freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| I'm for medical choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| I choose to support my health in other ways and the health of other people in other ways than mask wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5724)|
| 1:35:31| I think that's a very surface answer to what we have going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| If I lived in California when I was at that restaurant on Friday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| I would have had to put on mask on between bites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| Yesterday I read the governor of California's mandates for how Thanksgivings to be celebrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5746)|
| 1:35:54| If my friends, who are very famous, that live in Lake City, who have 20 children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| had Thanksgiving together and they lived in California, they'd be in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| They'd have to pick which two children they could have over for Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| and they would have to meet outside to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| And a whole list of 13 other mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| Please don't let our state follow suit with what's happened there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| because we're headed in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| People should have the choice to do with their bodies what they choose to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| as they see fit in dealing with their creator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5790)|

| 1:36:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| I'm Marcy Yadon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| I live in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| Susan, I guess that was her name down there, I was kind of proud of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| She did a really good job of not putting her mask on the podium like every speaker before her did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5824)|
| 1:37:11| Every one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| Every one of them took their mask off, sat on the podium, picked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| If this thing was about safety, this mask is what's catching all our stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| And it's sitting on top of everybody else's stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| We're touching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| We're touching everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| There's just no way that that's helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| Beyond that, it's not legal, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| I mean, why would you all give your power up to a board of health anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| It makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| Other than to not have to face the consequences of the decisions they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| It really should be a mandatory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| The validity, though, of their track record of actually trying to keep things safe versus following an agenda is not very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5872)|
| 1:38:05| If this was about keeping things safe instead of following an agenda, you wouldn't lay your mask down on top of where everybody touched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| And you all have heard the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| You've seen the list of all the things that contradict on the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| You've seen the list of all the businesses that close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| I've already talked once about our dairy farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| When the health department moved in to shut us down, and they shut us down for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| they announced all over national radio that we were a problem through the emergency broadcast system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5908)|
| 1:38:35| They called all our customers, and they didn't ask, what kind of testing are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| What are your procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| They're not asking that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| What are the procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Why is there so many false positives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| They're not asking this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| All they're saying is put a mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| It doesn't matter how many times you touch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| It doesn't matter where you lay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| It doesn't matter where you walk with it as long as it's on most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| It's not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| It's probably harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| And their goal before was not to help the people that they thought were getting sick off of our farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| Their goal was to follow their agenda of they didn't like raw milk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| They just shut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| They were very vocal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| It didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| A year later, we got a letter saying, hey, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| You didn't have an outbreak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| And the next farm that came along not long ago, they said, I talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| They said, you know, we learned something from dealing with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| You're too vocal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| So we did this one quietly, and they shut them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| They shut them out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| They didn't do it for the safety of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| If they were out about safety of people, they would have went into that business and taught them better practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| We learned a lot of better practices over what we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| We learned how to test for cleanliness of things that we weren't even ever looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5986)|
| 1:39:53| But that wasn't their goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| Their goal is not health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| Their goal was their agenda of milk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Right now, I don't know what their goal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| I know what I think it is, but everybody thinks they have a different goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| But it's obviously not about pure safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| I mean, if I brought a tape measure down there, y'all ain't six feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| And you don't need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| You're wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| But how is it, how can y'all not see that it's not safe to lay what I've blown my mouth and drank all over down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6016)|
| 1:40:27| The next person lays it down and picks it up and puts it back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| You take a picture with the mask off, you walk away and put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| This happened today downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| Are we about safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Are y'all just about covering your hind ends by letting another board make the decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| Instead of them coming to you with, hmm, we think this would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| And then as our elected officials going, hmm, maybe we should talk to our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| She says we're a minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| If we're a minority and you go, okay, we're going to raise this mask thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Most people keep their mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| So it shouldn't be a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| If that's all this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| Anyway, all I need to say really is, really, you ought to take your power back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| Get rid of this dang board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| It's silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| Andy Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| Andy Lewis, Howard Dahl, Margo Dahl, and Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| Let's see, those are the next four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| I'm not sure how much time we'll have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Andy Lewis, are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| My name is Andy Lewis, and I live on Fairmont at 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| And you know it's getting serious when the introverts come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| I've been to so many of these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| I remember one of my first ones, Commissioner Daley even asked me, are you just really bored or are you here for something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| And I don't like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| They're long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| They're boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| But I felt compelled to come forward, and I'm going to try to do it without a full-on panic attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6124)|
| 1:42:11| I wanted to ask for a quiet show of hands who here has been treated unfairly in a business, bullied in a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6131)|
| 1:42:20| whether it's by the business themselves or another person in the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| who has been mistreated by a business of any kind during all of this simply because you have an exemption to this mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6144)|
| 1:42:33| It's a lot of people, myself included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| I cannot wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| And what's interesting is I actually went to my doctor prior to the mandate to get an exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| because I knew I wouldn't be able to wear a mask, and I saw it coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| The problem is I've been bullied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| I've been talked down to in so many places that it came to a point where I could barely even go to the grocery store without a panic attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6170)|
| 1:43:01| Walking down the street is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| Trying to take my son to the park can be daunting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| Through all of this, this divide that this has created has separated our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| and it shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| This is a medical thing, and some of us cannot or will not wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| Not because we think it's stupid, but because we've taken the time to look at the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| and to listen to the doctors and the scientists that are not being paid by the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| that are not being paid by pharmaceutical companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| and we've looked at it and we've decided that it's not for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| I found it very telling about three weeks ago that the CDC came out with a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| showing that 85% of people that tested positive wore a mask most of the time or always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| The percentage of us that are testing positive for COVID that do not wear a mask ever is so small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| and you guys want to blame us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| The Board of Health wants to blame us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| We're not asking you to get rid of the Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| It's the Board of Health with their unchecked powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| And the fact that you want to wait until all this is over to then make it happen is ridiculous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6253)|
| 1:44:21| because I'm pretty sure I've seen billboard after billboard over the years for anti-bullying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6261)|
| 1:44:28| and yet online and in person, many of us are being bullied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| Our children are being bullied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| It was the middle school that had that sign out that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| don't be a COVID-idiot, wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| That is teaching our children that it's okay to bully and call names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| When we're sitting there, over the years, so many years, we've said no bullying, anti-bullying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| Bullying is not allowed. Cyber-bullying is not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| A very sweet girl came and spoke twice at this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| bullied online after the first time, and came back the second time and spoke again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| and I love that girl. She's brave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| But she shouldn't have to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6306)|
| 1:45:18| Panic attacks are a real thing. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| If we cannot dissolve this board and take back control of our city and give people their choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6321)|
| 1:45:30| which is what our country was founded on, was a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| I don't care if you wear a mask. Wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| If you think it works for you and it helps you, then wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| But I do remember at the last meeting, it was stated that my mask doesn't protect me, it protects you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| And I, for one, don't sit there and think that a mask only works one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| It's just a piece of cloth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| If you think it protects, then wear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| I, for one, do not, and I choose to do my health in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| I eat healthy. I get plenty of sunshine outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| We do everything in our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| Years ago, we got rid of all the chemicals in our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| You know, we do all that stuff for our health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| And I moved here seven years ago from California because East Tennessee was so friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6370)|
| 1:46:20| Everybody was so nice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| The southern hospitality was wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| And that is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| And I don't know if we can ever get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| And that's sad to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6390)|

| 1:47:17| Go ahead, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| I'm really hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| I have a bunch of Jimmy Stewart's down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| My favorite movie is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, so I have high hopes of who I'm speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6444)|
| 1:47:30| I loved the devotion before this started about the importance of submitting ourselves to the authority of God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| and not resisting that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| Now, I don't know what was in each of your hearts when you ran, but you asked people to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| You got a lot of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| You hoped for support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| You were believing that many of you, if not all of you, prayed to God that you would win your elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| to have the seats that you have, that you had a heart like Jimmy Stewart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| that you were going to take those seats because you were going to make America great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| You were going to make Tennessee great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| You were going to make Knoxville great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| People invested in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| People believed in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| People trusted you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| You have a vested interest in the people that have supported into your campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| the seats that you now sit in because people trusted and support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6496)|
| 1:48:23| And in a very real sense, you're abdicating part of that God-given responsibility that you hoped for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| that you prayed for, that I'm hoping you thank God for when you won your seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| when you allowed the Department of Health to make decisions in the governance of people of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6515)|
| 1:48:42| They weren't elected to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| No one trusted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| No one knows them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| No one invested in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| And they don't have a vested interest in Tennessee either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| They're like false shepherds that the Bible talks about that don't feed the sheep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| You were entrusted to feed the sheep, and you're the ones that are going to be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| and accountable to God for the seats that you were given to have this authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| And yet you abdicate that authority to people who are not having the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| and the support that you have and that they should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| And my appeal to you is to please dissolve that body because they were not elected to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6552)|
| 1:49:20| and they're passing mandates that have the potential to harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| and are actually harming thousands of people in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| It's not their authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| It's yours, and you're the ones that will be responsible for the decisions they make before God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| Whether you believe that or not, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| In the Bible, there's a man named Caiaphas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| He was a high priest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| He was a bad guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| Caiaphas is the one who made the mock trial of Jesus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| ultimately led to the torture and the beating up of Jesus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| and the death of Jesus, an innocent man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| Caiaphas held that seat unlawfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| He bought that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| It wasn't his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| He wasn't entrusted to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| Biblically, he didn't have a right to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| And he used that position to kill the Son of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| I'm not blaming him ultimately because we know that the Bible tells us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| before the foundation of the world that Christ died for the sin of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| So we know it was always the plan of God, but he's the man that was used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| and he was used because he was in an unlawful position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| and he caused a lot of harm to a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| not just to Jesus, but the disciples and many followers for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| He was a bad guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| I'm not even saying that the DOH are bad guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| All I'm trying to stress with you is it's not God-given responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| It's not their right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| They're not the ones who lawfully hold the position to make the mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| they're making and should not be allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| It's yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| Before God, it is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| And I ask you, I'm not accusing anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| but I want to inspire you to please do the right thing before God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| and take back the responsibility that was given you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| that people paid to have you in these seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| that God answered your prayers by giving you these seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| You're responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| You're accountable for that, not even to just us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| even though it's to us, too, because we voted for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| We trusted you, and we're trusting you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| We're trusting you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| We're coming before you and asking you now in faith and in trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| and in a spirit of goodwill that you will remember the joy you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| when God gave you the seats that you hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| that you will take to heart the responsibility you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| to do the right thing in those seats because you were elected to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| and God gave them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6696)|

| 1:52:24| COVID has upended UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| While I'm speaking to you now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| we have 50 cases in the hospital and 12 that are being tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| I'm very disappointed in how political the COVID pandemic has become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| I know the public's really growing weary of the mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| as are the doctors, nurses, and support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| However, the solution is not to disband the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| who are trying to make the best decisions based on the data they're receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| I know the physicians on the Board of Health are highly trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| and very reasonable people, and as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| they are not getting paid for their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| I know some of the physicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| I have the utmost respect for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| All I can do is share you stories from the front lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| So I teach residents every day in the Residence Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| and I can tell you some of the stories they've had to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| with taking care of patients in intensive care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| In July, one of my residents managed a case in intensive care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| Three out of four members died of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| One of the pulmonologists, who works in intensive care as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| just this last two weeks ago witnessed three die of COVID-19 in one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| One of my nurses in the office had her father die of COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| in a facility in Athens, Tennessee, if you all recall that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| that had the outbreak initially with COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| Then she subsequently succumbed to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| She was a little overweight and was at Fort Sanders in a hospital for a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| sustained bilateral pulmonary emboli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| She finally got out. It's been three or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| She's still not back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| We don't have her on regular duty in the office because of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| And we know by the medical journals we read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| there's ramifications of COVID-19 after COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| You're hospitalized for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| COVID-19 has been climbing at our hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| Our mortality has been good because I think we've got good doctors at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| good doctors at Park West that have helped people in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| But I'm worried that there's this lack of concern about trying to do what's right for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6870)|
| 1:54:37| I'm also worried about the lack of mask uses in surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| I believe that's driving up our numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| I don't know if you're aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| Vanderbilt basically said, or one of the director of Vanderbilt said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| the hospital capacity is at 5% now because they've had so many admissions for COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6891)|
| 1:54:59| But masks protect the most vulnerable part of our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| I have a 90-year-old father in assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6904)|

| 1:55:12| Mask wearing is going to protect these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| My father happens to be a registered Republican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| and was a small business owner in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| He started Central Veterinary Hospital down on Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| I come from a long line of Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| I grew up in South Knoxville, went to Doyle High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| And even though I came from a conservative family, we're pragmatic about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6931)|
| 1:55:36| COVID-19 should never have become a political issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| nor should wearing a mask become a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| COVID-19 is a public health issue, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| That's why the Board of Health, with its expertise, needs to help Knox County manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| Like if you went to see an accountant to have your taxes done, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| You're going to an accountant who's an expert in doing your taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| just like you go to somebody to service your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| You're going to somebody who knows how to service your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| We've all trained a long time to be a physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| I've trained 11 years after high school to be a physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| And I will caution you about listening to a faction of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| who is loud and organized, particularly if they are not data-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| I assure you, they don't represent the part of Knox County that I know in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| and engaged in a lot of public on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| I know many of the medical community are disappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| as I am on how this has been handled by our county in dealing with the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| And so I wish that you will listen to us and try to work with the Board of Health and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=6995)|
| 1:56:42| And I get it, it's difficult for the small business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| My dad was a small business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| I only have 16 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| I have friends that work downtown with small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| I think we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| We just need to let the mask take a precedence and open up slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| That's all I have. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| The speaker of this session of public forum will be Dr. Daphne Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| Dr. Norwood, are you a Knox County resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| After that, commissioners, we will take a short break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| and I'll announce it at that time when we'll come back for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| I'm Dr. Daphne Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| I live on Maloney Road in Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| I've been a doctor in Knoxville since 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| I have a master's in public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| I have been also a professor at the University of Tennessee for the entirety of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7054)|
| 1:57:41| I've taken care of patients in the Knoxville community as well as in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| And I was one of the physicians involved in disaster planning for UT Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| with regard to how our young physicians would be dealing with COVID-19 in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7071)|
| 1:57:57| and how the people not in the ICU but on the ward would handle things if things got bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| And I can tell you that it was a scary scenario that we were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| where if COVID-19 is allowed to continue unchecked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| then we would overwhelm the capacity of UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| We would start to double up patients in rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| We would put patients in the hallways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| People would die because we would not be able to do regular medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| at the high level that we're accustomed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| And I can tell you that UT Hospital in Knox County has a special responsibility as a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| because we are, as UT Hospital, a catchment for a broad area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| And we are seeing hospitals throughout the country, if you read the newspapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| in Arizona and other places that are overwhelmed by patients coming in with COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| beyond the capacity of doctors and nurses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| It is hard to forget the images from Wuhan, the images from New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| and the number of people who died because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| Good success would be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| We have had patients who have been transferred from Georgia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| because they could not find, I personally got a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| who could not find a hospital in Emory, in Nashville, and had to come here to UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7144)|
| 1:59:11| I do not want to see that kind of situation happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Over the summer, we had not many patients with COVID in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| We had under 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| Then, several weeks ago, a few months ago, we had 20 to 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| Starting about two weeks ago, it rapidly went up to 50 patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| It doubled just at UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| That doesn't represent all the patients that are hospitalized in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| And we are not responsible just for Knox County patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| We are responsible for patients that come from other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| requiring the higher level of care that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| I know that you know about the nursing home in Morristown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| where they had, I believe, 16 deaths recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| and several of the health care providers there also died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| I just want to see common sense prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| I understand that maybe some people can't wear masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| but do not let the minority rule here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| Do not let exaggerations and fantasies rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| Science should rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7209)|

| 2:09:56| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| Item 549-D-20-RZ is a request of Taylor D. Forster, OBOYS0YSOS Holdings, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7797)|
| 2:10:07| for rezoning from A Agriculture to PR Plan Residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| The property is located at 0 Severeville Pike, parcel ID 124192, Commission District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7812)|
| 2:10:19| Is the applicant here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| Is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| Please make yourself known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| Okay, Madam, or sorry, Ms. Brooks, if you would please give us your recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7827)|
| 2:10:32| Planning Commission recommends that Knox County Commission approve PR Plan Residential zoning up to two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7832)|
| 2:10:39| because it is consistent with the slope analysis and compatible with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| If the applicant would please state your name and address for the record and provide any relevant testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| Taylor Forster, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7849)|
| 2:10:57| I'm here on behalf of the developer, my client, YSOS, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| Can you speak closer to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| Sorry, it's just a little harder to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| YSOS, LLC, requesting for a rezoning to a plan residential zoning and requesting for a density up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7865)|
| 2:11:15| As you're aware, this property falls into the low density residential sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| which in the county affords a density anywhere from one dwelling unit per acre up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| This property is also identified in the plan growth area of the growth policy plan here in this south county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7886)|
| 2:11:36| You know, we understand that the property does have some hillside challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| That's nothing to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| However, we think and we submit that we provided a preliminary site plan earlier today that shows a more condensed proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7904)|
| 2:11:56| that shows having attached townhome style single family residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7916)|
| 2:12:04| When you prepare it and design a site plan like that and construct such a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| it's going to result in it being more condensed and there's going to be a lot less disturbed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7929)|
| 2:12:14| In proceeding with such, if it is approved at three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| then a lot of this mature vegetation, the mature existing tree line will remain undisturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7938)|
| 2:12:25| therefore creating this buffer, creating this separation from the surrounding parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7945)|
| 2:12:30| Based on the preliminary site plan, it would appear that about two-thirds of the property would remain undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7950)|
| 2:12:38| A client recently had a use on review approval within this same district in the same south county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7958)|
| 2:12:46| and that's located at 200 Sweetwater Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| And I bring up this as relevant because that property experienced the same topography challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7968)|
| 2:12:56| also surrounded by other parcels that are single family but larger tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7976)|
| 2:13:02| That proposal received a recommendation up to 3.97 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7982)|
| 2:13:09| Again, the proposed development is similar, the topography is steep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7989)|
| 2:13:17| but there has been an approved design that went through the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| that provides for this more condensed type development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| that alleviates some of these challenges that the topography provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8004)|
| 2:13:36| Based on the market research, there is a demand in this area for affordable single family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8016)|
| 2:13:43| Now, the south county in this area does have very challenging topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| The demand is still there, and the demand still needs to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| And we submit that being able to create creative design structures, design creative layouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8033)|
| 2:14:03| will afford the ability for several of these more challenging properties to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| to provide this affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| Again, we are requesting simply a rezoning here today and a density of up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8052)|
| 2:14:18| If that is approved, then we will still have to go through, as you are aware, this use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| where a detailed site plan, a detailed grading plan, detailed elevation, landscape plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| are all going to have to be submitted to planning commission staff, reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| and then go through the planning commission process and be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8072)|
| 2:14:37| Again, this just gives us, permits us the permission to go forward with such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8077)|
| 2:14:43| Anything less than three dwelling units per acre does not provide for a viable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8083)|
| 2:14:48| It's just not affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Any developer, any residential developer will tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| You've got to have a certain amount of density to provide for the infrastructure's cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8093)|
| 2:14:58| to be able to develop these lots and construct these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| Again, we request that you approve the rezoning request, but approve it up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8104)|
| 2:15:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| Is there a discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| I've got some phone calls from the residents of Dinwood, and we've got some e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| and we've got a great e-mail from Mr. Houser explaining some of the things that this, according to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8124)|
| 2:15:35| I'm sorry, I forgot your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| Forster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| Mr. Forster talked about, is the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| As a teenager, back in the 70s, us boys ran all over that hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8141)|
| 2:15:47| We explored the sinkholes and did all that, and there's quite a few sinkholes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8147)|
| 2:15:54| It is very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| I think it's unsuitable for the density that you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8157)|
| 2:16:01| I think the Knox County and Knox County planning staff made the correct decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8161)|
| 2:16:08| I don't want to see vegetation moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| I don't want to see another Jones property on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| These sinkholes are drains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| You cover one sinkhole, and you change the drainage down the road downstream for these other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8179)|
| 2:16:25| And I'm afraid that that's what's going to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| Even at two dwelling units per acre, you're going to disrupt the flow, the drainage of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8188)|
| 2:16:39| This property, I'm sure, has a lot of underground streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| It's all limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| Back in 81, 82, I had a friend that wanted to build a house in Denwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8205)|
| 2:16:52| He couldn't build a house because of the limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| It would have to be blasted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| And someone with more money bought the lot, and they blasted it out and built the house because of the limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8217)|
| 2:17:05| I don't really know about the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| They may go in easily, or they may have to do blasting through the limestone and the shale rock and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8231)|
| 2:17:18| We don't know that until the utilities start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| But I've got a feeling that it's going to be tougher than what we think it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| It's not going to be the $100 custom area foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| It's going to be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| This commission, for besides a few of the commissioners, the new ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| back in May of 2019, there was a 5.5-acre parcel right across the road that they wanted to zone five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8257)|
| 2:17:48| It's got a big sinkhole on it, and if that sinkhole is filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| everybody down Kimberlin Heights down to all the way to Stock Creek, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| is going to feel the brunt, would have felt the brunt, the blow for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| So that one was defeated for a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8284)|
| 2:18:15| Because of the, there's, like I say, I ran all over that hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8295)|
| 2:18:21| and I'm pro-development where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8301)|
| 2:18:27| I'm pro-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| I voted immediate times for more density than, and we got, you know, I might have been on the losing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8308)|
| 2:18:36| But this one here, I'm not comfortable with at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| Because of the sinkholes, the drainage issues, I don't want to be in another Jones property where they're losing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8321)|
| 2:18:49| the Joneses are losing their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| Sinkholes are coming in, and they're losing their home because they changed the drainage of the property up on the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8332)|
| 2:19:03| We all live downstream somewhere, and I believe that the character of the Denwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8343)|
| 2:19:13| which is really most of the residents that live in Denwood, they've been there 25, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8353)|
| 2:19:18| They're my age or older, and the reason a lot of them are not here is that's because of their age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8358)|
| 2:19:28| and the fear that they don't want to be sick, and I don't blame them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8368)|
| 2:19:35| And I told them, I said, I will do what I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8375)|
| 2:19:42| I don't want to destroy the character of the neighborhoods, which is one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8382)|
| 2:19:48| I think, like I say, Knoxville, Knox County planning not only got it right on the ridgetop and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8388)|
| 2:19:56| the 10-4 vote even confirmed that, that it should be at two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| It is very, like Mr. Forster said, there is a great hillside challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8402)|
| 2:20:08| and I want this commission to realize and understand it's not our responsibility for a developer to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8408)|
| 2:20:19| It's not our responsibility because he can't make money at two per acre that he needs three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8419)|
| 2:20:25| That's not my responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| So I'm going to make a motion that we accept the recommendation and the vote of 10-4 at two per acre per the Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8427)|
| 2:20:37| Knox County planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| Okay, we still have some lights on, but I'll entertain a second and then we can continue discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| So we have a second by Commissioner Durrett and a first by Commissioner Daley at two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| Ms. Brooks, on your slope analysis that the staff did on, I think it's document page eight of your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8452)|
| 2:21:01| if I'm looking at the numbers correctly, it appears that this site, that 70% of the acreage is 15% slope or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8461)|
| 2:21:14| Am I looking at, is that what your report says basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| Yeah, 15% or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8484)|
| 2:21:25| Amy Brooks, Knoxville, Knox County planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8485)|
| 2:21:26| So a little over 20 acres is in a 15% or more slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| So that's about almost 70% of the usable land is 15% or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| And I agree with Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| I think your staff and the commissioners with the Metropolitan, or excuse me, Knoxville, Knox County planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8501)|
| 2:21:47| got it correct when they recommended two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8507)|
| 2:21:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| Commissioner Durrett, and I'm going to have a question for Mr. Snowden in a minute if you want to make your way up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8514)|
| 2:22:00| Commissioner Durrett, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| Try to yell into your microphone if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8524)|
| 2:22:05| It's a little hard to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| So, Mr. Forrester, is the developer planning on doing any kind of infrastructure improvements along with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8527)|
| 2:22:14| And the reason why I ask is because I went out there yesterday, and I walked some of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| and I spoke to some of the residents, and they're very concerned about not only the adverse effects of the limestone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8540)|
| 2:22:30| and sinkholes and the downfall or the downhill from that, the drainage and all those problems that could cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8550)|
| 2:22:37| but also of just the increased traffic and what it could do to their roads and to their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8557)|
| 2:22:45| and just curious on what the developer plans to do, if anything, regarding infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8565)|
| 2:22:53| Again, that would come if we're permitted to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| That would come through the use on review process and obviously would follow the staff recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| and whatever the engineering department requests as a part of those staff recommendations, that approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8581)|
| 2:23:11| Any kind of potential road damage that may be caused by construction would be secured with a road bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8591)|
| 2:23:17| And again, if infrastructure is necessary, then yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| the developer will accommodate that and provide for that as recommended and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8602)|
| 2:23:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| Mr. Snowden, I have a couple quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| I drove this road as well. These roads look wide and in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| Do you have any concern over the traffic issue as it relates to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| No, I think their only access is internal to the subdivision. I don't believe they access Sevierville Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8624)|
| 2:23:50| Gondola, I think, is the Gondola Drive, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| Yeah, and obviously there's a three-lane section on John Sevier there, so there's adequate turn lane there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8633)|
| 2:23:59| And then the subdivision street is 26 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| So from a transportation infrastructure perspective, I wouldn't have any concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8641)|
| 2:24:05| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| Mr. Forster, has anybody on your team or the developer done any single or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8646)|
| 2:24:17| done any studies or really examined what's there and what's usable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| I mean, a lot of it seems to be incredibly steep that you can't use anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| but for the portions that are able to be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| Yes, the engineering firm, and I wish Billy Fulgham could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| He's having to take care of his elderly mother and can't really come to public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| and try to coordinate Zoom, but I don't think that process is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| But in talking with Mr. Fulgham, he did confirm that he's aware of the sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| and that his team's aware of them and actually how that proposed layout would avoid a lot of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| I don't know whether there's open contours on there or closed contours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| but that they are aware of those sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| And again, and he stressed, just because a three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8700)|
| 2:25:06| if that's rezoned with that density, doesn't necessarily guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| that he can lay out a site plan to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8709)|
| 2:25:13| You know, we deal with sinkholes nonstop in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8713)|
| 2:25:17| It's just the fact of where we live and whether it's limestone subsurface or karst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8717)|
| 2:25:24| it's all very susceptible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| But we also have an engineering process, an engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8726)|
| 2:25:31| in conjunction with private engineers that know how to handle these situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| and know how to address these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| And either you can do it this way or you can't do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| We could get into this and say, based on the costs that would be associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| with controlling the potential sinkhole or opening of contours or drainage that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| you know, you can't afford to develop here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| But we don't know until we get there, and we don't know until we have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| to review and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| And, you know, I guess if we stopped everything just at the beginning of a proposal based on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8761)|
| 2:26:07| and I'm not disputing that there's sinkholes on there, Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| I think everybody agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| It's just, you know, we have to deal with them constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8771)|
| 2:26:16| And I think there are appropriate measures and mechanisms that can be put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| to alleviate that or control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| And again, it's not about the developer making money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| It comes to a balance point of can a development happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8786)|
| 2:26:31| Am I going to spend more on infrastructure cost and build out than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| can I even break even on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| And if that's the process we look at, then nobody's ever going to develop anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8796)|
| 2:26:41| You know, nobody's developing subdivisions just to break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8801)|
| 2:26:47| And again, I think Mr. Snowden can confirm that, you know, there are processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| from an engineering standpoint that you can develop and mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8811)|
| 2:26:56| or alleviate these potential concerns of sinkholes and how to design and develop around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8816)|
| 2:27:03| Ms. Brooks, when there's a piece of property that has a significant portion of hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8823)|
| 2:27:10| that is pretty, well, it's unusable because it's so steep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| doesn't that usually sort of prompt adding more density in other areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| You have a big piece of land and you can't use this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| Doesn't that usually end up in more density in a smaller concentrated area than spread out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8843)|
| 2:27:32| I think that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| I think it depends on the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| I think that's, you know, we encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8855)|
| 2:27:36| I think that's one of the purposes of that hillside and ridge top plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| is to think about those types of things in terms of where you put development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8859)|
| 2:27:44| So on the flatter portions is definitely more desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8864)|
| 2:27:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8870)|
| 2:27:51| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| First, I'd like to remind everybody that we're still on zoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| Use and review concept plan is a later stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| I'm looking at the toe pole on this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8887)|
| 2:28:11| and I'm trying to find the sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| What I'm seeing is a lot of this is just valley land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| The Blue Line Creek is at about the 920 elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8896)|
| 2:28:23| I don't see any of the typical surroundings with the arrows going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| to indicate an actual true sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| I see a couple and I see indentions, and they're all in the 940 elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| Is this riddled with sinkholes or is it just low valley area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| It does appear on the KGIS maps that there are some hatchered contours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8920)|
| 2:28:45| which would indicate sinkhole activity, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8925)|
| 2:28:51| You have to kind of zoom in really tight and you can kind of see in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| I guess it would be the southwest corner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8935)|
| 2:28:59| is kind of where all the water, primarily all the water from the site goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8939)|
| 2:29:04| and it does look like that there is a hatchered contour there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| and that a sinkhole on this property and the sinkhole actually expands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| over onto the other property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| I see a couple that are definitely sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8955)|
| 2:29:20| and this one just looks like it would be a good place for a lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| I mean, it's a fairly large area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8964)|
| 2:29:29| Is a piece of property like this manageable, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| And I hate to put you on the spot, but you are the engineer amongst us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8972)|
| 2:29:37| And certainly, Taylor, you know, with Billy Fulgen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| we have the utmost confidence in Billy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| He's one of the best engineers around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8983)|
| 2:29:47| I think that, you know, given a good site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| you know, there could be, you know, the three dwelling units and acre here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| There are obviously some concerns that obviously have been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| but my department would do everything we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| to ensure that those concerns would be mitigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| So, yeah, I mean, I think there is some engineering that could be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| to mitigate some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| Mr. Snowden, what is the bond for a road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9023)|
| 2:30:29| What do you require from a developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| For a road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| I don't know right off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| It's per linear foot, but I just don't know off the top of my head what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9035)|
| 2:30:40| But it is a per linear foot basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| And then our hydrology bond is based on the features, the pipe, the catch basin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9042)|
| 2:30:49| the detention ponds, and then we have a grading bond that is for stabilization as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9049)|
| 2:30:55| Would it equal, in your opinion, would it equal a mile of paving that we have to pay now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9055)|
| 2:31:01| Yes, it would, because it includes, in addition to the final surface like we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| it includes the binder course, the stone underneath there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9066)|
| 2:31:10| It essentially is if we had to go out there and construct the road from a vacant site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9070)|
| 2:31:14| So that bond is a lot more robust than just a resurfacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| What about a bond on the drainage pond, the retention pond, the environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9079)|
| 2:31:27| What type of bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| Is there a bond required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9089)|
| 2:31:30| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9090)|
| 2:31:31| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9091)|
| 2:31:32| There's a hydrology bond that's based on the site storm structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9092)|
| 2:31:38| and then there's also a grading bond that just covers the stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| So to the degree possible, we try to have a robust bond process in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| that should something go wrong that the public can go or the county can go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| and make those repairs without any cost to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9112)|
| 2:31:56| So let's say everything on this piece of property or any piece of property goes great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9116)|
| 2:32:03| There's a $100,000 bond that the developers put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9123)|
| 2:32:08| That bond is released and goes back to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| In other words, for myself, for clarification, and our new commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9131)|
| 2:32:16| how does this bonding work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| Well, my staff calculates the bond, so it's not based on any of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| it's based on the plans the engineer for the developer submits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| but my staff, you know, verifies that bond amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| We update that bond amount annually based on, you know, inflation, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9152)|
| 2:32:37| And then we obviously take in either a bond, letter of credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9157)|
| 2:32:42| cashier's check, those type things, secure that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| and we do punch lists out there monthly to verify that the work that is supposed to be taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| is taking place, and we don't release that bond until not only that inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9171)|
| 2:32:57| but the project manager for the site has concurred that the work associated with that bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9177)|
| 2:33:03| has been completed according to the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| So I'm looking back, and if you had not been to the Jones property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9187)|
| 2:33:13| every one of you all need to go see the Jones property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9193)|
| 2:33:16| So this is what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9196)|
| 2:33:19| I can see the Commissioner Smith is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| The CINCO, everything rings to the southwest, to that major CINCOs down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9204)|
| 2:33:30| And if something happens, there's going to be people flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9210)|
| 2:33:34| Now, who's responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9214)|
| 2:33:35| Is the Knox County going to be responsible for the flooding that will be created?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9215)|
| 2:33:40| I'm sorry, could be created by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| Or where will the developer be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| The developer is going to come in, and he's going to develop, and bye-bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9226)|
| 2:33:52| So my people downstream, and there's a lot of them downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9232)|
| 2:33:57| there's a possibility that their basements will be flooded, or we could lose Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9237)|
| 2:34:04| because that will go probably underneath Sevierville Pike to the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| I don't know that for a fag, but the odds are that's where it's disappearing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9248)|
| 2:34:12| because I don't see it on top of the ground on heavy rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9252)|
| 2:34:16| I don't see it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| So who's responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| Is Knox County going to be responsible, or is the developer responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| or is he going to say, sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9263)|
| 2:34:26| I would like to say we do have a little more robust procedure in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9266)|
| 2:34:31| when a site drains to a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9271)|
| 2:34:36| Typically, we require the tension is such that it meters the flow out very slowly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| but in sinkhole locations, we actually assume that the sinkhole is plugged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| that there's no infiltration whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| and we set it such that the 100-year flood can store in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| and not negatively harm anyone or a structure adjacent to a downstream structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9294)|
| 2:34:59| So there is a little more safeguards in place when areas do drain to sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9299)|
| 2:35:04| because we know, unlike a detention pond, it don't slowly release out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| It may be entirely plugged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| So there is some further assurances that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9309)|
| 2:35:13| that would prevent some of those things from occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9313)|
| 2:35:20| You're the greatest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9320)|
| 2:35:21| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| I'm voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9326)|
| 2:35:28| I mean, I'm voting yes for the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9328)|
| 2:35:30| because I just don't feel comfortable with anything above two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9330)|
| 2:35:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| Mr. Snowden, for an entrance road into a subdivision in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9338)|
| 2:35:44| what is the percent grade that the maximum you would allow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9344)|
| 2:35:48| Fifteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| Is it ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9349)|
| 2:35:50| Amy may have to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| Fifteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| You can go up two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| Is there a way to compare that to a slope percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| Which would be a ten percent grade is a what percent slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9362)|
| 2:36:07| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| You're getting my math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| You put me on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| Would it be less than a 15 percent slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| That was the number in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9381)|
| 2:36:22| Yes, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Would it be less than a ten percent slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| Say again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9386)|
| 2:36:27| Would it be less than a ten percent slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9387)|
| 2:36:30| A ten percent road versus I'm not sure if I followed the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| You talk about an entrance road coming into a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| The grade can only be ten, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| I think you can go up to 12 with a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| It's 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| You can go up to it shall not exceed 12 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| Twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9407)|
| 2:36:48| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9408)|
| 2:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9409)|
