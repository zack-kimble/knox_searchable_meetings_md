| 0:05:02| Alright, let's, let me go ahead and call this City Council workshop to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=302)|
| 0:05:15| This is a workshop on the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| I want to ask somebody, sorry, I sigh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| Let me ask if Mr. Brown will lead us in an invocation, and after that I will ask Ms. Palmer to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=328)|
| 0:05:40| Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| We ask that thou would go with us as we try to make decisions that affect this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| Bless each and every person who is assembled here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=359)|
| 0:06:07| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=367)|
| 0:06:15| Madam Recorder, will you call the roll please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=379)|

| 0:06:33| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| We have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Let me go over a real quick review of the agenda, and then ask if there are any reports from council members that we need to share before we get started, and then we'll move into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=400)|
| 0:06:50| This is a workshop on the East County Sector Plan, which has, as many of you know, one very controversial item with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=410)|
| 0:06:59| It also has a lot of really good thinking and a lot of stuff that we should hear about, and here's Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| The way the agenda is structured is we're going to have the first section where we're not going to talk about the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| We're going to talk about all the other stuff in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| We're going to have a presentation from Mike Carberry is listed, but I think Jeff Archer is actually doing the presentation about the whole of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=437)|
| 0:07:26| After that's done, we're going to move into a discussion, part two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| We're going to have discussion during that, questions from council about what's in this, and then we're going to move into talking about the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| We're going to have a short presentation to start that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| After the presentation, we're going to move the podium back, and we're going to have the two sides of the issue at the tables here to make presentations as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=461)|
| 0:07:53| and then we'll sort of move into questions as we go on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| We need a motion to add public forum, which I will, and all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=480)|
| 0:08:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| So public forum is added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| There's a sign-up sheet at the end of the table here if you want to speak, and at the end of the meeting, we will not just use the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=490)|
| 0:08:19| If you're interested, after we've gone through that, there'll still be a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| I don't know that there's anybody on council that needs to leave early, so at this moment, I am not thinking, oh, my God, we've got to get through this quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=503)|
| 0:08:31| If there is somebody who has to leave, you might let me know, and I'll try and move things along a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| I think that's the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| As far as the equipment goes, the microphones have a green light that if it is on, your microphone is on, and everybody can hear you, and we can record you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=520)|
| 0:08:51| so if you're speaking, please make sure your green light's on, and let's help our neighbors with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| We don't have any lights to indicate people want to talk, so we'll have to do a little hand-raising on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| You hit where it says push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| People can raise their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| We can keep this, hopefully, flowing smoothly, and I'm hoping that we can have an interactive discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=551)|
| 0:09:19| I hope this isn't something where it's just one person speechifying for a while, but we can discuss this some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| Having said that, are there reports of council members that they want to share before we get going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| Mr. Becker, you have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=573)|
| 0:09:41| On April 8th, the Community Development Department of the city is going to be doing a tour of development projects in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=581)|
| 0:09:52| It's National Community Development Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| It's going to be that afternoon, and right now it's scheduled to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| They want to hear who from council is interested, so they're thinking right now about renting a bus to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| and if none of us are going, they probably won't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| so hopefully you'll have an email to follow up on that, but I wanted to announce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| Comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Let's go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Mr. Archer, do you want to come up and start the presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| Mr. Carberry or Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| I'm going to hand the baton, so to speak, to Jeff Archer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| Just a couple quick words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| This presentation concentrates on the land use proposals and the conservation proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| A few weeks ago, you adopted a county and city park, greenway, and recreation facility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| That same plan is included in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| If anybody needs to see it, it's on a board over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| The only other thing with community facilities is that in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| citizens pointed out that Carter Elementary School is not in the best of shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| PBA had done a survey, and we showed the results on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| I believe it was about a week ago the school board put in a budget to make improvements to the existing school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=677)|
| 0:11:26| I just wanted to bring that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| The transportation element is not going to be a slide, and here it is in your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| It's the same transportation element of the Transportation Planning Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| who is essentially our transportation arm, and they collaborated with us in developing this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| Okay, I'm going to try to get through this relatively quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| We have about 30 slides, gives background as far as the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=717)|
| 0:12:06| The East County Sector Plan probably was – okay, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| Give you a little overview as far as our planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| We have the general plan, which is the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| and a sector plan is one component of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| We also have the growth plan, which is mandated by state law that feeds into the general plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=745)|
| 0:12:35| The sector plan and the general plan cover such issues as economic development and trade uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| housing uses, agricultural and forest conservation, community facilities, transportation, and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| Some of our implementation tools, how we implement the general plan and sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| is through the zoning and subdivision regulations, the capital improvement program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| community involvement, and voluntary compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| As far as the planning process, this was one of our longer processes that we used to solicit public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| It consisted of two advisory committees, five sector plan meetings, one roundtable meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| and that was concentrating around issues associated with Midway Road and one MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=797)|
| 0:13:26| Looking at the growth plan, the gray area that you see is the city area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=806)|
| 0:13:38| The blue area is the urban growth, and the yellow area is the plan growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| and then green, of course, rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| The significance of this is that the gray area is the city area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| and the urban growth basically is an area that the city can go in and annex into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| so that could be possibly a future city down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| Looking at some of the numbers behind the growth plan, within the East County sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| 52% of the total land area is rural residential, or rural area, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| and the acreage over here corresponds with the pie chart on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| There's 1,564 acres within the city, and there's 40,245 acres within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=865)|
| 0:14:36| Looking at the land use, general description, this is the East County sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| There's Sevier County over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| There's a Holston River over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| There's a French Broad down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| There's 40 going right through the center of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Through this presentation, what I did is we put the page numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Those correspond to the plan, so if you want more detail behind any of these recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| they're located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Generally, the area from my cursor down, so all this area right here, is agricultural uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=904)|
| 0:15:16| and then here would be low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Some of the commercial hubs would be Strawberry Plains area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| There's two parcels over here that are in the city, over near Midway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| that we'll talk about in a little bit, approximately 135 acres of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| that hasn't been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| There's some other smaller commercial around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| There's some community commercial up on Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| and there's also some rural commercial throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| Looking at the agricultural land use, that's for farms and agricultural-related uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=947)|
| 0:15:56| and also low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| The hillside protection on this land use map, I don't know if you can tell on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| but in your plan you can actually see there's a little bit of a shading area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| and that's more the steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| Our land use policy as far as hillside protection is we prohibit commercial and industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| and hillsides greater than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Slopes between 15% and 25%, two houses per acre, and then 25% to 40%, one house per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| Some example pictures of ridge slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| Looking at the low-density area is all in this area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| One of the main constraints as far as doing the land use proposal is the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| The land use proposal here is in accordance with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| Medium-density residential or office, we have a category where they're interchangeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| because the impact is relatively the same as far as vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| and it makes a good transition from a higher-intensity use to a lower-intensity use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| The circles are representing where those are indicated on the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| and they're mainly around the Strawberry Plains interchange area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1032)|
| 0:17:22| The community commercial I was talking about before was in Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| where the grocery store is over near Breakville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| That's where retail and service-oriented development, they include supermarkets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| and things that you would go to within your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| General commercial, there's, of course, the Strawberry Plains area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| which is more highway-oriented commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| There's some general commercial down near the Forks of the River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| and the commercial that I was talking about over near the Midway Road intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| One of the main things that we heard throughout this process was people wanted to maintain the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| and they wanted to enhance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| One of the things we're recommending in this plan is a French Broad conservation corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| That's indicated by this green hatched area right along here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| and this comprises 5,134 acres or about 10% to 12% of the actual sector itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| And in that section of the plan, there's recommendations as far as doing a conservation overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| transfer of development rights, new agricultural zone within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| We really have a sprawling agricultural zone, so we want to increase the lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| so we can have a true agricultural zone and a kind of a rural residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| We want the ability to do conservation subdivisions, conservation programs that exist now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| we can enhance them, and historical and archaeological programs to keep things along the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1140)|
| 0:19:08| as far as the historical and archaeological treasures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Before you leave that last slide, is the conservation corridor from the road and below to the river?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| It's hard to see the hatching up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Generally, if you look at my cursor and then follow it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| it basically looks at the ridges and the view sheds, so it actually goes north of the road in some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1168)|
| 0:19:36| And it has all those bends in it, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| You can see it better probably on page 41 of your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| As far as the French Broad Corridor, it definitely was an asset that the community wanted to preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| and we saw it coming up with a conservation corridor as the means of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| The way the conservation corridor was developed, getting at the boundary issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| was looking at the agricultural, mainly the soils in there, looking at the historic resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| looking at the water and recreational, and looking at the aesthetics and habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Basically, if we overlaid these onto maps, when you put them on top of each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| what is the boundary that you get that encompasses the concentration of those assets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| This shows a little more, and I'm blown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| The river is running through here, and basically if this recommendation goes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| we would include this in the south county as well, and that represents this whole area down below the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1236)|
| 0:20:46| One of the things that we heard through the planning process was our sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| just like any kind of municipal lines, are just tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| but really to do a conservation area and preserve agricultural and view sheds and preserve the water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| we're talking about both sides of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| We went and looked at the south side also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| If you incorporated that into the approximately 5,000 acres to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| and you include the 4,671 to the south, you would get about 10,000 acres, which is a huge land area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1278)|
| 0:21:27| Some of the things that could be developed as far as tools to preserve that conservation area and enhance it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| is landscape conservation, trees, making more pedestrian-friendly and bicycle-friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| sign standards, looking at the private development as far as the architectural standards and location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| Those are just things that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| This is the idea of a conservation subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| This is kind of typically how you have development, kind of scattered in larger lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| and you could do the same concentration, and if you look at here, you have the same concentration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| but it's built into the woods, and you preserve the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| It's more like clustering the development as a tool that could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| One of the unique things that we have in this plan also are seven mixed-use districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| We went into a mixed-use district kind of in our planning process because there's not one use that is suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1345)|
| 0:22:36| There could be a multiple of uses, and there's also a lot of times site constraints, and we wanted to list those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| And so in this plan, there's seven of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| The first one is right as you come across Asheville Highway, across the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| there's a large area between the river and Asheville Highway that we're calling the mixed-use area number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| which is the Holston River Gateway, and we recommend that planned commercial, mixed-use, medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1382)|
| 0:23:10| all those uses could go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| And the common theme that you'll see as far as the recommended zoning for all these is that we want a planned zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| because there's a multitude of uses, and there's site constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| For example, this large area doesn't have any roads, and it's along the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| so we want some site control so we can make sure that it's developed in a sustainable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| Jeff, is that the south side of the river where the old drive-in theater is or the north side closer to the cement plant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1413)|
| 0:23:42| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| That's on the south first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| It's on this side of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| It's on the south side of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| And does that include the area where the food line is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Looking at the East County number two mixed-use area, this could be a business park, technology park, town center, office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1440)|
| 0:24:12| medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| A portion of this site is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| A portion is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Again, the recommendation would be a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| The third one is town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| This is getting more out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Appropriate uses as far as public facilities, there's a lot of public facilities already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| There's a park, library, school system there, so there's components for a town center already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| Mixed uses as far as low-density residential, medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| You could also do mixed uses as far as more of an urban or vertical fashion versus horizontal, commercial and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1484)|
| 0:24:53| And the recommended zone would be to develop a form-based zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| There would have to be a little more work that goes into this one because the road systems and utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| and everything would have to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Is a town center just it serves the local needs like pharmacies and stores like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| What's your definition of a town center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| A town center is trying to get more of those uses but also the residential in there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| It's more of a mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| That's why you mentioned form-based?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Yeah, that's the form-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| This is an illustration from another community of what it could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| More like if you picture kind of a village, kind of main street area, more like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| One of the unique areas is the marble quarry area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| It's an old quarry that has some water bodies in it, old mining lakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| and we think there's enough land that could be worked around it to come up with a unique development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| and that could be office, business park, mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Again, because of those site constraints, it would be a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| Looking at Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| one of the things we heard through the planning process was getting more specificity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| as far as the different uses and different characters along Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| so we broke it up into a couple of mixed use areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| The EC05 is an area where we're not recommending commercial be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| There's presently not a commercial area in there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| It's directly adjacent to a community commercial that serves the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| So we would be looking at agricultural uses, which currently there's actually a picture of it right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| low-density or medium-density residential or office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| and the recommended zones that correlate with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| And then that surrounds the area, the left portion is actually in the city there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| the East County number six, which does allow commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| and the other uses that were listed in East County number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| agricultural, low- and medium-density residential, and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| The cross-hatching is throughout this land use plan that you see along the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| Our recommendations for scenic and highway corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| one of the things that we heard throughout the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| people want to increase the aesthetics along the commercial highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| and also the rural roads that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| So we're recommending that an overlay be established for those two kinds of areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| that enhance both safety and the aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| This is an example as far as John Sevier, how it could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| The top, you have how it looks today, and the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| dealing with the public realm and the private development associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| You could have how it looks there, an artist's rendering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| This could include pedestrian and bicycle paths, landscaping along the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| sign standards, and storage behind the fencing and landscape buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| It looks like John Sevier has gone to Charlotte or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| But outdoor storage on some of these trailers and stuff like that is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1701)|
| 0:28:31| Looking at kind of that was a summary as far as some of the land use recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| and I wanted to throw this in because really there's not a huge difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| between when the sector plan was updated in 2001 and 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| What we really did is add more specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| For example, the previous plan talked about a mixed-use area along Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| but really there wasn't any definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| So it really was a little hard to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| because it didn't define what kind of uses go in there or what the interim zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| One of the useful tools that you'll see in all our sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| is actually in one of your appendixes as far as land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| for all our sector plans where we talk about how we got to those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| and what they're meant to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| and what appropriate zones would be recommended in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| So you could basically see there's an Asheville Highway here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| They called for a community center, which was that orange area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| They called for a concentration of commercial in Cartertown Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| and you could see the same thing did here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| We just added a little more specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| Preserving the agricultural area, we took that a step further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| and came up with the conservation overlay and implementation tools in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| They have commercial and office over at Midway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| and we added more specificity as far as the different uses that can occur there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| So I want to concentrate on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| There's a lot more detail as far as the five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| This is the implementation plan that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| One is developing the French Broad Corridor as far as the conservation corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1814)|
| 0:30:22| Two is the highway and scenic road overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| This is already in the works now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Adopt new provisions for hillside protection, land disturbance areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| conservation subdivision, and best management practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| And fourth is a general rezoning, actually, that we call out for the Midway Road area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| This is a blown-up map of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| This is in the Midway Road area but not dealing with the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| This is C4 uses, currently not developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| You can see it's right there, 72 acres to the north side and 64 acres to the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| And that's currently zone C4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Currently zone C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| As planners, we think that's really a big issue that hadn't really come out in the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| There's been a lot of concentration on Midway Road and the business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| but as far as keeping the rural character, we think this is probably the biggest impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| if those two parcels were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| If you look at what's happened to Dumplin Creek and the development down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| and taking down hillsides, that could easily be done in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| Could you tell us how planned commercial is different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Planned commercial, we have the objectives in here as far as protecting the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| So it would give us slope side protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| It would also allow us to make recommendations as far as if an internal road system was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| where it wouldn't connect to adjacent residential roads and bring traffic through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| It allows you to deal with the site as far as good site design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| which the C4 doesn't go through that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| That's all I have for the first part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Questions, comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| Yeah, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| I have a question about engaging the public in some fairly technical planning is an art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1949)|
| 0:32:39| and takes a good bit of facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| Was the 2000 and the 2010 pretty much a comparable process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| And how would you describe that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| One of the things that we do in our sector plan process is we try to kind of gauge it basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| on the area and the issues that drive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| When I talk about first that this is kind of an abnormal sector plan process, that we had more meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| We tried to reach out with a survey as the first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| and the community didn't like the use of the survey as the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| So we set up an advisory committee that had neighborhood leaders that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| well, what do you want the first step to be in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| And the first meeting was more of an educational as far as what is the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| What is the general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| What are the land use categories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| What are the mechanics of planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| And then we rolled into the next meeting was trying to get more into the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| into the East County sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| And another process that came out when we're probably about three-quarters of the way through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| the public input process, there is somebody made the suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| Elaine Clark actually made the suggestion as far as having a roundtable discussion as far as bringing TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| KUB, the Development Corporation, MPC together to concentrate around issues around Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2046)|
| 0:34:16| And I don't want to get into too much of the details behind that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| but there's some miscommunication about what each of those agencies was doing behind their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| So we got together with a UT professor, Professor Jacobs, who facilitated with the law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2066)|
| 0:34:36| She facilitated a meeting, which we were part of, along with the community organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| and we got somebody from TVA there to present what actually their presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| what their project was, and the Development Corporation did a similar process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| So that was something that came up midstream that if you master planned a planning process out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| that you would never see that, but we had the flexibility to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| and bring in an outside facilitator because we wanted to make sure that it was being looked at objectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| and not having MPC lead the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| In the education process, was there any kind of discussion or education around the relationship between the city and the rural areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2111)|
| 0:35:21| In other words, there's a movement toward building our cities from the inside out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| I mean, or I could see how a process out in, like, the East County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| you could create a kind of vocabulary that was isolated from some of the newer urbanist trends, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2137)|
| 0:35:47| I mean, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Yeah, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| One of the things that we tried to make, and I tried to make it apparent here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| is that the sector plan is a component of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| The general plan is a comprehensive plan for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| And so it's just one component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| So it's not, I think there's sometimes this viewpoint in the community that there's different municipal plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| and you could develop them any way you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| And there's, in my second slide when I talked about the planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| there's an agenda for quality growth, which is adopted by the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| which outlines policies, which we try to implement through our sector plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| Did that get explained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| So that philosophy of growth is explained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| The goals as far as the policies in the general plan were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| the general plan's always referenced because we're implementing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| As long as you're on that topic, when was the last time you updated the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| or does the sector plan simply do that for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| In other words, when did you form the general plan that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| And the second part of that is those areas like along Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| you had the six or seven mixed-use areas and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| How do you define the boundaries of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| How do you draw the bubble and say this is either going to happen here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| or it ought to happen here or it's suitable for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| And how do you make those decisions and how do you define the boundaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| One of the main reasons why we differentiated this is we heard from citizens in this area here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2245)|
| 0:37:32| that one of our earlier recommendations was to have commercial along Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2252)|
| 0:37:41| And one of the issues that we heard from the community was there isn't commercial now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| and I don't want commercial next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| And so looking at the amount of commercially planned in our plan that's zoned out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| we didn't feel that there was actually a population to support that commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| so we could keep that area without the commercial recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| I'm sorry, that was the five area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| And if you think about it, too, one of our recommendations is a community center right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2294)|
| 0:38:22| So we want to concentrate the community-serving things right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| rather than sprawling out in shallow lots along Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| But, I mean, do you follow topography?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I mean, how do you define the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| How do you decide how wide or how big it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| Asheville Highway presents a little bit of an issue because normally we will follow parcel lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| but some of Asheville Highway, those parcels go really deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| And so traditionally commercial uses locate more in the first 500 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2329)|
| 0:38:57| so we use more of a 500 or 600 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I've got a couple myself, but I don't want to dominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I have some concerns about how we implement some of these recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| but first I want to recognize MPC Commissioner Rachel Craig is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| and Knox County Commissioner Mark Harmon are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| We appreciate their public service and their willingness to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| I don't think there's anybody else in the audience who is an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| But I wanted to ask Mr. Archer about this is going to be a little bit of a long question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| When I came on to council, when we got sector plans, they were resolutions, one reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| and the sense was always they were just recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| And now I think we're doing them a little differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| We are actually changing a sector plan with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| We are implementing something that controls growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| And I want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| On page 35 we list the East County Sector 1 Holston River Gateway section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| and it has recommended uses and recommended zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| My question is when we adopt this plan, are we saying these are the zonings that will be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| or is there another step we have to take to say these are the zonings that will be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| and how quickly can we get to that next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| It's used as a guiding document for rezonings by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| And so if somebody comes in with a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| the first thing we look to see if it's consistent with an adopted sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| There are things that could be initiated through administration or city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| or even MPC coming with a recommendation to either bodies for a general rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| But that's not led by the actual owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| So if somebody comes in to say this one where the recommended zonings are all planned zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| and say they want to do a R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| would that take a sector plan change as well as a zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| or just a zoning change after this is adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| It has to be consistent with the sector plan, so it would have to be a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| I think that's a good way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| So that actually means when the first step in all this implementation is the adoption of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| That is a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| I wanted to just raise an issue about the commercial zones at both Straw Plains Pike and Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| I notice we've got some huge, the Straw Plains Pike is a lot bigger than the current commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| and the Midway is the same, the redder area is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| And on both of them, we're putting a commercial button up right against agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| And I'm wondering, I think we definitely need to move on that general rezoning to move the Midway Road to a planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| And I'm wondering whether we've got some similar plans at Straw Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| because, again, it looks like we have the potential of Walmart buttoned up into somebody's farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| and that's not good planning, and I want to see what we can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| At Strawberry Plains, we really addressed the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| We didn't expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| We didn't contract it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| We looked at basically the current land use, current zoning out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| We didn't get into the trouble when you're dealing with such a large scale like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| you don't get into parcel-by-parcel recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| So you try to look at the overall pattern in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| One of the things that came out of the public discussion when we asked about Strawberry Plains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| everybody felt it was a dealt card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| It's highway commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| It's always going to stay highway commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| There's other priorities in the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| So that didn't rise to a level as far as having an overlay as far as the whole intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2573)|
| 0:43:02| We noticed that in the proposed land use, there is an overlay that goes on Strawberry Plains, a hatched area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| So in the recommendations, we could control better signage for future development, landscaping, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2588)|
| 0:43:16| And currently that whole red area is already zoned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| Pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| It's already a dealt card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| And we have you can't make it out on this one, but at the very end of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| it's one of those medium-density residential and office things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| Because one of the issues that I think we have as far as trying to cap the commercial rather than having it keep going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| and you'll notice right here, right here, and over to this side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| we have medium-density residential and office as kind of those caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| So it's a transition to lower-density areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Other questions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| If not, maybe we move into Part 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| And, again, I guess I have Mike Carberry starting this off, but that actually could be Jeff Archer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| Mr. Archer, if you want to move into the seventh special use district and we'll start that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2657)|
| 0:44:31| This is the seventh mixed-use area, which is the Midway Road interchange area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| Consistently with our previous mixed-use areas, we list a multitude of uses that can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| Business park type 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Type 2 business park, if you look at our land use classification in the appendix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| would outline that it's not a heavy trucking facility as far as distribution, warehousing, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2691)|
| 0:45:03| Office park could be an appropriate use, technology park, or even town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| Of course, just like with all our other ones, a planned zone would be recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| As far as on this one, I want to outline some of the site considerations as far as looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| prohibiting regional warehouse distribution facilities, limiting commercial to incidental commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2724)|
| 0:45:32| and sewer handled on site or connected to East Bridge or Loves Creek treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| Basically, the conversation came up through the process as far as a sewer treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| and there's discussion early on that they're possibly looking at the French Broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| but if we're doing a conservation overlay in there, it doesn't make sense to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| So that got us to the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Also, as far as, I'm going to have some numbers on this in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| but as far as the prohibiting warehouse and regional distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| what we're trying to do is maximize employees per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| We don't have a lot of large tracts of land left in the city of Knoxville or Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| as far as could be developed for economic development, so we wanted to maximize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| Some slides in a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| When you say large tracts, was there a size projection that you used for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| What's a large tract in your definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| We'll get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| A hundred acres was looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| And as far as limiting commercial to those commercials that need to support the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2798)|
| 0:46:47| that we didn't want to get into kind of a sprawling highway commercial scenario there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| where we have the two exits to either side definitely have enough of those uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2813)|
| 0:47:01| So it was more kind of a smart development of our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| Early on in this process, everybody's aware, I'm sure, that there was a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| and the issue came up as far as that there hasn't been significant changes in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2832)|
| 0:47:20| and this is a listing of a lot of changes that have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| since the last adoption of the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| We have adopted a growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| Knox County continues over the long run as far as a population and workforce growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2851)|
| 0:47:39| We have lost business park sites through rezonings that have been outlined in our sector plan processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2859)|
| 0:47:49| and we've lost land for future businesses through privatization of business park parcels and expansions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2869)|
| 0:47:58| There's changes in wastewater utility management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| It's being looked at differently as far as how it's handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| We outlined before that we're getting more specificity as far as our land use classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| and how we deal with those through our planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| TVA is starting to locate a switching station there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| and also we had the 2005 business opportunity site that looked at more new sites as far as business opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2906)|
| 0:48:37| and also we had 2008 we looked at more brownfield sites as far as how economic development could happen in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2917)|
| 0:48:47| Jeff, excuse me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| What do you mean by three and four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| What do you mean by loss of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| I'll get to some of these examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| The next slides illustrate them more of real-life situations and facts and figures, so let me hit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| They'll come up in a couple slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| Looking at the population and workforce growth, it's over the long trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| I know we've had some economic downtrend lately, but over the long run we're increasing in population and also workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2952)|
| 0:49:23| This is broken out by Knox County and the East County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| In the general plan I talked about that we have the agenda for quality growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| One of our policies in there is develop a sustainable economy that will provide good jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| weather economic downturns, and provide high quality of life for the largest possible segment of our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| Also in the general plan it talks about economic development should be balanced across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| with opportunities created through development of new sites, redevelopment of older properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| and expansion of existing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| I think this is a strong point because one of the things that you hear throughout the process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| why aren't you developing I-275 brownfields or why aren't you doing green development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3007)|
| 0:50:16| Isn't that sprawl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| But looking at it, to be a smart community you have to do a multitude of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| You have to look at new sites because we really don't have acreage of existing sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| to locate larger businesses that can supply quality jobs for our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3030)|
| 0:50:39| We have to look at redevelopment of older properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| I think it was relatively recently that you passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| it might have been last meeting, the frontage road for I-275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| So that's a strategy as far as trying to look at the brownfields for economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| and also expansion of existing businesses or existing buildings in some cases too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| So it's not one approach, it's a multitude of approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| I have a question on that slide on the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| Are you projecting or do you look at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| considering the 2010 census that's coming up as far as the population growth or decline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3076)|
| 0:51:24| What are your projections on that if you can have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| Yeah, these are projected out numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| We won't have those numbers for a while for the 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| I think they actually come out later 2010, maybe even 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| So those numbers aren't available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| I think people are receiving the questionnaires right now in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| I think I just received mine yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| So the numbers aren't available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| We project those out over the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| Mr. Brown, every two years the Census Bureau conducts a survey that they rely on to make population estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3110)|
| 0:52:01| So we get an updated population estimate very regularly throughout the decade leading up to the bicennial census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3121)|
| 0:52:11| I got my form in the mail a couple days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| And it will be a year or two before we get data for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| The estimates are pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| This is looking at what I was talking about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| We're trying to maximize employees per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| And this is looking at the Institute of Transportation Engineers IT International Report 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| And it looked at case studies across the country as far as employees per acre different uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| And you can see trucking and warehousing, these are in ranked order as far as employees per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3162)|
| 0:52:51| That is between 11 and 14 employees per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| If you look at business park uses, it's at 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| So that's why we're not making a recommendation as far as including regional distribution or warehousing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3179)|
| 0:53:06| because we're really not maximizing our employees per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| This gets to Duane's issue as far as what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| This is just one example, and this is actually in the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| This is a business park that was recommended in the previous East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| and a subdivision has happened in the middle of it through a rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| So it basically took it off the books as far as able to do a business park in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3213)|
| 0:53:42| I'm sorry, that's right up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| And those 70 acres were the subdivision that was in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| So in essence, about 300 acres was lost in that location as far as a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3235)|
| 0:54:04| And then generally, if you look across the county from 2000 to 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| we lost over 700 acres of land zone for industrial-related uses within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3250)|
| 0:54:20| You say lost by that same process of developing it a different way, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Going through a rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Going through a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Now, we were told at one of the council meetings that early out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| you had labeled all of the land along railroad tracks as industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| but that didn't pan out, and the modes of transportation changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| Is some of that related to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| In other words, land near a railroad is no longer necessarily prime industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| The modes of transportation have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| Years ago, that was common practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| It was 1,000 feet on either side of a railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| Back in the 1950s, somebody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| well, that must be good for industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| But the topography was not taken into account in many of those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| And in this particular sector, the railroad is actually on the other side of the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| but that line came over into those bends up on the Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| Those areas are still zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| We've recognized in the plan that let's consider general rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| They're way off of Ruggles Ferry, back winding through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| So they're not in a particularly good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| They are not in a good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| So residential is probably a better use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| Yes, and it's shown as low-density residential new land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| And when we talk about losing industrial land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| is part of that this recognition that maybe 1,000 feet on either side of a railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| might not be the classification need when you give other considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| like location, topography, and all those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| And a lot of that 1,000 feet, and I'll use the valley between Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| and essentially Washington Pike where the railroad runs down from Murphy Road and on down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| that was all zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| And on a piecemeal basis, developers were coming in and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| I really don't have a market here for industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| I see a lot of condos there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| So you have a lot of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| And it's been common practice that those locational factors that didn't make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| the rezoning was approved by the city or the county after an MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3396)|
| 0:56:46| Where the actual practice doesn't seem to mesh with what the plan foresaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| Is that what you're saying basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| And in some of those cases, generally we look upon some existing zones as a dealt card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3413)|
| 0:57:01| It's really hard to change those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| But in other cases where it just doesn't make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| we will recommend what we believe is the proper land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| And probably the one shortcoming is that we probably need more general rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| to rectify the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| When you say loss of 70 acres, business park within the east sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| how many acres are designated in the east sector plan for business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| For business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| For business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| Do you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| There are mixed use districts now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| Obviously the development corporation still has an interest in the EC07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| the Midway location as a potential business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| and there's between 300 and 400 acres in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| And then in the Breakville situation, which is the other white one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| that was one of the sites that was identified in two different studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| and that area is well in excess of 300 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| But in this plan we're saying that could be a mixed use area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| it could be a business park, technology park, a variety of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| So the one with the circle is definitely out, but the one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| I guess that's for all planes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| It's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Breakville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| Breakville, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| That's still a potential for an office park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Office park, business park, tech park, medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| The lay of the land is pretty good at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| That was one of the seven mixed use areas that we identified and went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| If I could follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| When we talk industrial, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| I'm picturing all of these plants going to Korea or China or India.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| What's our definition of industrial in that context as opposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| obviously, we're talking about business parks, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| We're talking office buildings or light manufacturing, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| What's the industrial classification in this present era look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| The EC zone that has been developed has a list of potential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3551)|
| 0:59:19| It could include manufacturing of auto parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| It wouldn't be heavy given the site of these to have a whole assembly plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| but you have several examples in this region of whether it's brake systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| or electronic systems for automobiles that are within business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| East Bridge, West Bridge has conventionally had those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| Tech, more light industrial, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| It's not heavy industrial what you envision, the smokestacks or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Those days are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| It's definitely light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| As far as when one looks at the economic development picture in this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| and around the world, it's a very fluid situation where, yes, some jobs go overseas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3602)|
| 1:00:11| The classic in Knox County was the loss of all the textile jobs between 1970 and essentially 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| That portion of our labor force, workforce, really went from about 19% down to about 8% today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3618)|
| 1:00:30| And it was the loss of those essentially lower-paying jobs elsewhere outside the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| But by the same token, Volkswagen and Nissan and others are a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3637)|
| 1:00:46| Toyota has the brakes too now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| Yeah, they're sticking on the chin a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| But the point is that foreign-owned companies are also building in this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| and the need for components in relation to those continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| We saw expansion at the Clinton Industrial Park just about three weeks ago, and also high-tech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3663)|
| 1:01:12| The development of solar panel features out in that park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| and they chose this area because of the resources at Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| and the electricity systems that we have in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| If I could, and I don't want to take up too much time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| when we had the presentation on the slides, at one point one of the items was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| industrial-type properties went private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| So, for example, if you're at Forks of the River and Panasonic leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| is that still not available in your definition because we don't own it but it's in private hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| How do we deal with that acreage that has been sold but is still going to be available for that use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3710)|
| 1:01:56| I'll give you two of the foremost examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| When you go out to the airport, you pass by Power Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| and you see all those front-end loaders and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| That was first marketed as a business park, but they had access problems there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| and they couldn't solve them with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Sevier Heights Baptist Church came in and said, we'll buy the whole park for our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| Well, it took the better part of 70, 100 acres out of potential job creation and into a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3739)|
| 1:02:28| The same thing happened out on Pellissippi Parkway where the Faith Promise Church is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| and essentially took over a major portion of what was to be a business park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| Admittedly, it had a lousy connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| But I'm talking different in kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| I'm talking about if Panasonic decides not to manufacture here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| there's still a manufacturing plant, and maybe we recruit someone who fills it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| That's not included in that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| We're recognizing that those lands are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| You're talking where the use is totally converted out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| I think to that, too, is getting back in the general plan goal as far as it's a multitude of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| looking at new development, looking at redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| That would be an example of redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| It's an existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| There's brownfield development that there's just issues going into the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| So the government, a lot of time, has to step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| So it's a whole multitude of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| Let me be real quick, Mr. Archer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Commissioner Harmon, my good friend Commissioner Harmon, had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| I'm going to ask him to hold that for a little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| and hope that he remains my good friend after I do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| So let me move on to Mr. Archer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| Looking across the county, we looked at business opportunity sites in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| and the pink areas are actually areas that we came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| And the criteria for looking at these was appropriate terrain less than 6% slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| and not subject to flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| Vacant land, and this gets to the question before as far as what size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| vacant land over 100 acres and mainly comprised of 20 acres or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| basically 20 acres meaning you're not putting together 101-acre parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3848)|
| 1:04:16| So there's a practicality of it as far as certain size parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| Compatible with the surrounding areas as far as the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| Traffic wouldn't be generated through residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| There's some sites that are located away from arterial highway or interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| where you would actually have to go through a residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| so we wouldn't be recommending any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| Accessibility as far as freeway, arterial highway system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| And as far as sanitary sewer, natural gas should be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| or potentially available on the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| So looking across the county, there's really not a lot of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| The Midway Road area was one of the areas that was identified along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| with some other areas for business park opportunities in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3908)|
| 1:05:17| Mike talked earlier about as far as one of the zones that could be used there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| in the Midway Road area is employment center zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| What employment center zone allows you to do as far as use and review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| just like we talked about some of those other unique mixed-use areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| that we have a planned zone, as we call it, so we get use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| And they would actually have to list the specific uses that are set with zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| so it would be a list for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| It would limit retail to those that are allowed to serve the business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| and also it would have design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| Some examples as far as landscaping, lighting, buffers, and screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| Some of the issues that have come up as far as the actual site itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| and I want to quickly kind of glance on some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| What we show here as far as the water features, there's two main water features here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| They're not full-year wet weather conveyance streams or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| They're showing some 20-foot contours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| Some of these are sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Some of these are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| The main point of this is just like any land in East Tennessee that you put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| you have to work around some site constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| And this area, too, is still being looked at, I believe, as far as a TVA switching station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4008)|
| 1:06:57| And where is that supposed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Development Corporation could speak more exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| but as far as I understand, it's up in this quadrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| That northeast corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| The 74 acres you were talking about for commercial, that's below the yellow line to the right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| Yes, that's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Part of it down there, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| And that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| What I'd like to do now is if we can get some folks who can move the podium and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4041)|
| 1:07:31| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Now I want to get the Development Corp up for a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| and then turn it over to the 8th District Preservation Association and French Broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4056)|
| 1:07:46| I want to get the podium moved so we have good view here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| I don't want people behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4070)|
| 1:07:56| While that's happening, I think this is official, that Tennessee did win today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4076)|
| 1:08:08| That wasn't the case when I left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| Let me turn this over to Mr. Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| And I've asked both sides on this to take no more than 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| and I'm hoping both of you can take less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| and then we can move into questions to bring out things more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| So please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Did you say 5-0 or 1-5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| 15 or 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| 15, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| I will try to take much less time than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| You might need to lean in a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| I'm Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| I'm the Executive Vice President of Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| This is Rhonda Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| She's the Executive Vice President of Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| I want to talk about a few other people that are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| because they may be of some benefit and help in answering questions that you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| or may defer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| Mike Edwards is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| He's the Presidency of the Chamber in the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| Kim Henry, who I work with in the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| is a lawyer at the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| We have Mike Stomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Mike's a geologist with S&ME.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| If you've got some questions about the topography and geology of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| David Harrell is with Vaughn & Melton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| They are site civil engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| And Mike Hines is with Southeast Environmental Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| who we're consulting with related to the wastewater treatment system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| And then I did want to mention that Mr. Elmore, Bill Elmore, is here with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| and ultimately KUB would own and operate that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| And I had not originally planned on doing a presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| but as I thought about it today, I figured I'd better write some notes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| or I would forget some pretty important things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| Let me just say that we don't completely agree with everything that MPC has proposed for our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| in their East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| We do think they should be applauded for their effort to address the special needs of the East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| and the overall general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| The Development Corporation, along with the Knoxville Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| we work on behalf of the City of Knoxville and Knox County to provide economic development services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| and we engage in those programs and activities that seek to improve the economic well-being of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| such as job creation and maintaining a stable tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| And part of those activities are ensuring that we have suitable sites within the county for companies to locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| and to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| And the reason that this is important, because if we do not have suitable sites within our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| to meet the company's needs, then our community is never even considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| For instance, if you have a store owner who chooses to have a very limited inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4243)|
| 1:10:49| or no inventory in their store, should not expect that people are going to shop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| And our case in this one particular item that we're talking about has to do with land and new land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| And I certainly want to recognize, you know, you mentioned Panasonic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| those are assets in our community, and we are certainly marketing those every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| and showing those are at some point they've become pretty special purpose facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| and they don't meet everybody's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| But they're clearly on our radar and highly marketed to the extent that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4276)|
| 1:11:24| When we talk about, you know, what's the hurry for developing a business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4284)|
| 1:11:33| it says what's the hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| The proposition of developing a business park is a very long-term issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| This one's been going on for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| And while we do have some inventory, it would not be practical for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| and it certainly would be irresponsible for us acting on behalf of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| and the county as its economic development agencies to wait until we're out of business park property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| before we ever start doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| You just can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| And let me talk to you about some of the things that I expect or that I have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| I don't know if I'll hear them tonight, but I have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| There are those that opposition to this that say that business parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| are a 1950s model of economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Smart communities don't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| And I'm not going to sit here and tell you that things like having an educated workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| skilled labor, favorable business climate, entrepreneurial support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| are not important because they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| And we work in all those categories and we feel like that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| But by the same token, you know, having land is still important and it's still relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4356)|
| 1:12:44| And those who say that it's not are incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| If having a business park is no longer a valid part of the community's economic development effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| then we need to go up to Anderson County and tell them that they don't need confluence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| because they didn't need that business park for confluence to locate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| That's old school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| They don't need that $2 million in investment or 250 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| And then SL Tennessee shouldn't expand by 35 million and 300 jobs to Fort BW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| That's old school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| We don't need to tell more freight service in East Bridge Business Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| that we don't want their $10 million expansion and 100 new jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| because that's not the investment that smart communities are doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, $55 million investment, 350 new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| I could go on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| We are going to continue to have need for property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| and business parks as part of our community's portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| Companies continue to need to have places for people to make things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| to handle things, and to employ people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| And it's not the only answer, but I want to hopefully make the point that it's clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| that it's an important part of the community's economic development portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| There's been arguments that if the Midway Road is such a great location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| then where's your list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Why don't you show it to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Who's waiting to go there if we need it so bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| Let me say this about businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| They're not the proposition when they need to expand of waiting around on the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| to possibly build a business park that they own, that they might get rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| that they may be able to get started on and have ready in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| It doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| I would be shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| If you had a company that absolutely had to go there, had absolutely no other choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| maybe that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| But that's not the world we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| Companies have choices and they have to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| There's arguments that nobody's going to locate there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| because of the on-site wastewater treatment system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| When we first made the proposition that we were looking at all our options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| on wastewater treatment, we looked at a bunch of different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| And one of them was, it certainly was the most controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| was we would support the development of a new wastewater treatment plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| that would serve the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| And there were concerns about the sprawl that it might induce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| and I can certainly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| But where we are today is we are developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| and Mr. Hines can speak to this in more detail about the technical merits of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| and KUB can talk to the ongoing operation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| But, you know, that is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| And it would only serve the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| And at least 80% of the companies in our existing business parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| could operate under those, on that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| You know, there's a saying that we should forego business park development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| in favor of ecotourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| And in your report, or at least it was in the report I had seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| there's, from the French Broad Preservation Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| commissioned the OX report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| And you look at their numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| and they're anywhere from 50 to 191 direct and indirect jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| If you run the math out, it's around $7.64 to $8.39 an hour jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4543)|
| 1:15:51| What we're talking about is a business park that would create a substantial number of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| up to 2,200 direct and 2,300 indirect jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| so around 4,500 jobs that it could support versus 150 to 191,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| $108 million in annual payroll in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| But here's the really good news about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| You don't have to do one at the expense of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| If ecotourism is important, then I think we should go for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| But it doesn't mean that we can't do a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| In fact, the French Broad Corridor, where they talked about overlaying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| and putting preservation on a conservation area of 5,000 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| and you add that to the other side, that's 9,700 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| It's two miles away on the other side of the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| and I recognize that it is a valuable resource to this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| but it doesn't preclude preserving that if you develop a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| You know, we worked with ten different property owners to put this property together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| and they were all willing sellers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| We didn't use condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| We don't have that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| Certainly, the county commission wouldn't have exercised its authority to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| and there's a lot of different uses that could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| I just want to say that business parks are about creating opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| to facilitate the creation of jobs in a stable tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| and we believe that the positives far outweigh any negatives that there may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| We think that the 380 acres that are located on the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| interchange, with almost all the utilities already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| is in the third most populous county in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| It was identified in 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| and a 2005 study is an appropriate site for a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| It's not only suitable but a logical place for business park development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| and that's my fair comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| I don't know if Rhonda has anything she'd like to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| Let me go ahead and turn this over to the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| and French Broad Preservation Associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| and ask you all to talk for a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| You can do it either at the podium or at the microphone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| I just feel a little more comfortable reading, and it's going to be reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| Chris is going to pass out, hopefully, what I can say in about five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| and it has some documentation of the claims that I make in this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4690)|
| 1:18:22| I've heard Mr. Napier and others refer to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| It started in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| First of all, I want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| Would you identify yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| I'm Bob Wolfenbarger, and I'm with the 8th District Preservation Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| And you need an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| I'll give you my Kodak Road address, 8416 Kodak Road, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4718)|
| 1:18:49| And if I might begin, in 2000 there was a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| and if I may allude to if you look at Item 1 on this document you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4734)|
| 1:19:01| that tells you that the number of sector plan meetings we had as a steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| to prepare for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Item 2 will show the actual sector plan meetings that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| And then if you look at Item 3, this is the general review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| and it will also make reference to the development corporation at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4758)|
| 1:19:29| decided at the end of the process to include an industrial development at Midway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| on this almost exact same track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| And that was after this process was concluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| and we were ready to do a final draft that we learned of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| And as you can see in my notes there, we were just devastated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| And we asked the planner, how could this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| And he said, well, he had just learned of it that week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| and that he was disappointed to tell us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| But he exclaimed to us at the time, and I think I have the quote in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| My apologies, I'm not reading what I intended to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| But he pointed out to us that it was about urban sprawl and a sewer plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| Actually, he called it a wastewater plant, and frankly at the time we didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| We didn't know what in the world he meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| I mean, we just didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| But we were a little confused anyway after we'd gone through a whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| and no one had discussed the possibilities in this industrial part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| Item four will allude to the designation when Mr. Carberry came out to make the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4827)|
| 1:20:37| There was about 250 people at Carter High School that were outraged that this thing could be proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4837)|
| 1:20:45| and particularly because it was proposed without any input from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| Following that, we were at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| Commissioner John Mills suggested to the planning commissioners, excuse me, planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| that maybe they should meet with the community and try to work this situation out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| And so we brought our attorney and myself, a guy named John Weber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| who is from the Three Rivers Preservation Association, by the way, and couldn't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| We met with Mike Carberry, I believe, is it five times, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| I'm sorry, I can't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| One, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| I think a total of, well, it says three on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| So three times we met with him, and we negotiated whether or not this should be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| and ultimately we wound up with that proposal at Johnson Road that Mr. Carberry referred to, that 70 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4893)|
| 1:21:40| The development corporation was adamant about keeping that 70 acres on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| even though all the residents in the neighborhood in that immediate area were opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| But they kept it there, and that was part of the compromise that myself and John Weber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| and our attorney and the Metropolitan Planning Commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| We compromised and agreed, well, go ahead and put that industrial site there since it's next to the dog food plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| for those of you that don't realize there's a dog food plant up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| It's called Something Protein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| I can't remember the name of it exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| But anyway, we agreed to that, and we also agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| actually we promoted the idea of having that office site there at Strawberry Plains Pike and Breakable Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4933)|
| 1:22:20| We encouraged that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| And for doing all that, with one exception, they agreed to take the Midway Road off of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4942)|
| 1:22:31| But we had to concede that commercial zoning at Midway Road that you all were discussing earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| the two pods on either side of the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| that was part of a concession the community made because they told us that there was imminent demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| for commercial development at that interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| And by gosh, it had to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| And so we conceded to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| Anything to get the industrial park off the map, and for them to make it go away, we were happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| And that's exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| When was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| This was in, I'll give you the exact date of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| Yeah, it was in 2000, but it was September 6th, 6-12th, and October of 2000, October 4th of 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4988)|
| 1:23:15| All the dates are on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Anyway, finally, I came back to the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Excuse me, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| The 70 acres is the area up in the northern part of the East Sector Plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| The one that became a subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| If I can get Mr. Archer, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| The one that became a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| Well, it was already developing as a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| There was already about three houses on Johnson Road at the time, rural residential houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| and that's what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| It was rural residential, and they thought because that dog food plant is at the dead end of the road on the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| that that would make an appropriate site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| Now, frankly, I probably would-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Matter of fact, I didn't disagree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| but when the neighbors that lived there engaged in that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| they were very displeased with that being designated as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| and to be frank with you, the County Commission removed it when it was being adopted at the County Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| which is also noted here, when that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| I don't see it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| I was going to try to make this brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Obviously, it's not turned into a brief because I'm not reading very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| We engaged, as I said, Wayne Kline at that time and negotiated it, and it went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| Unfortunately, on-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| Pardon me just a sec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| Anyway, we engaged Wayne Kline, and we negotiated to get the Midway Road thing removed from the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5083)|
| 1:24:50| and that's the way the final sector plan ended up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| and it went through City Council and County Commission was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| And then fast forward-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| By the way, that happened on the 28th of November, 2000, when it was adopted by County Commission, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5099)|
| 1:25:09| Then fast forward to 2006-excuse me, 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| and I read in the newspaper about the Chamber of Partnerships having a meeting downtown at the old city hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5115)|
| 1:25:23| and they're going to be presenting to developers potential industrial and other development sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| And Chris and myself and John Weber got on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| We talked to each other, and we said, well, maybe we ought to be there about 6, 37 o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| and see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| And we get there, and lo and behold, if it's not Mike Carberry with the map of Midway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| and other industrial parks that you saw earlier designated in that purple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| and they're promoting Midway Road as an industrial site only 18 months after we've adopted a sector plan that says it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5145)|
| 1:25:57| We could, you know, what can you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| We were just disappointed that the system doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| But we went on, and we kept in the back of our minds, hey, these guys are going to be doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| And sure enough, we started hearing rumors in 2005, late 2005 and 2006 that here comes some real estate guys out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5167)|
| 1:26:16| trying to buy people's property and offering outrageous options on property that normally would sell for $8,000 to $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| They're offering crazy money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| I mean, like $30,000, $29,000 I think is what it averaged when it sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| And so moving forward, shortly after that, in 2006, the development, while reading the newspaper again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5188)|
| 1:26:39| that the development corporation and MPC is going to propose a sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| and rezone that property at Midway Road to an industrial park, all contrary to the existing sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| So we are outraged, and we start raising canes, calling commissioners and stuff, and how can this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| And next thing you know, the commission recommends to MPC that they do a public meeting to get public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5215)|
| 1:27:03| Well, we went to that public meeting, all 300 or so of us at Thornbrook Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| and basically Mr. Edwards and company told us this is the way it is, and, quote, it's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5229)|
| 1:27:17| That's how it went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| And so at that point we decide that if this thing proceeds through county commission and MPC, as it ultimately did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5239)|
| 1:27:27| which is noted here and I have the dates, that we would pursue it legally, and we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| And Chancellor Fansler ultimately found it to be the case that it was done illegally and improperly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| and there had been no substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| I want to remind you that I have Knoxville News Sentinel articles for every allegation I've made here to verify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5260)|
| 1:27:47| In front of that you will find a six-page, I believe, segment out of the 2000 sector plan verifying the meeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5267)|
| 1:27:56| And Councilman Woodhull asked some questions earlier about if this was an extensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| if the 2008 sector plan process was extensive or how did it operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| It was nothing compared to the process that we had in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| Every detail of the sector plan, including community growth and development, public service facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5292)|
| 1:28:23| and all those listed in there were separate meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| We dealt with every issue in the sector plan as individual meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| We had 14 total meetings at Carter High School and Carter Library to develop that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5309)|
| 1:28:37| And a lot of these concepts they're talking about here today that, you know, the corridors and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| we talked about all that back then, but we were assured that there was no way to affect them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| to make them happen because there was no legislation that would allow it to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| but we could talk about it in general terms and that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| Now we have it all polished and shined up, but there's still no way to affect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| And that's my time and I thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5340)|
| 1:29:14| My name is Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| I live at 6229 Babley Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| I'm also here representing the 8th District Preservation Association and the Thorn Grove Community Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5360)|
| 1:29:28| This has certainly been a very long process and it's a complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| and important issue that we're talking about here with a lot of unanswered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| But I really would like to thank all of you for taking the time to listen to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| and to really try to get your arms around all of the implications of what this means for this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| as well as for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| And I would especially like to thank all the long-suffering community members who have gone to meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| after meeting after meeting and turned out in unprecedented numbers during this sector plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5400)|
| 1:30:08| Both of them, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| Going back to what Bob says, you know, this is a great sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| It's got a lot of great ideas in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| But as he said, there's really not that much that is very new here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| except for putting a business park at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| All of these concepts that they're talking about, implementation plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| and tools that they're planning to talk about, you know, they don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| This scenic corridor, conservation corridor, all of these things, these districts, none of this is in an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5434)|
| 1:30:43| And so there's really absolutely no way to affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| And one thing I have learned is you better get it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| And, you know, one thing I would ask you out of this sector plan process is that you ask MPC to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| finally, with codifying some of these concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| If we're going to use them and we're going to put them in a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| and we're going to talk about them and say this is, you know, what we're giving to you, community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| to protect what you love, then, you know, let's move forward on actually putting these concepts into code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| so that they can actually have something done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5477)|
| 1:31:25| You know, one of the things they talk about is some of the problems and issues associated in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| And, you know, they keep referring to these general rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Well, I know how much you all love rezoning somebody else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| I don't think this is going to happen, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| I also wanted to mention that David Boock, our attorney who filed the lawsuit, the successful lawsuit, had a family emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5501)|
| 1:31:49| He planned to be here tonight to answer any questions that you all may have had about that lawsuit, which is also ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| And he said he would be happy to appear at the next city council meeting if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| So if you have any questions for him, he would be happy to come and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| Everyone is very concerned about jobs, and certainly, you know, our economic development agencies are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5528)|
| 1:32:16| charged with a difficult task of trying to bring jobs here to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| And, you know, I think you have a hard time finding anybody who says, I'm against jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| I don't want any jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| I just don't think that that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| But I think the community has some concerns, and I think they're valid concerns, that building business parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5554)|
| 1:32:42| and calling that economic development when we have quotes from Doug Lawler at the chamber, Dr. Matt Murray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5562)|
| 1:32:50| We have, I think, even Rhonda Rice and Todd Napier saying that the real key that they're finding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| and I have a new Sentinel article that quotes them in it that I'll make sure gets in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| that the key is not location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| It's not the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| It's not even incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| It is the educated workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| Can these people that are moving to their county, can they do the job that I need done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| Do they have the skills that it takes to make those jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| And so, you know, that is really for my economic development dollar as a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5602)|
| 1:33:29| I would like to see the development corporation or some economic agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| I know that the Knoxville Chamber has done some things that I agree with with regard to education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| and I'm happy to see them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| But I don't think we've gone far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| Instead of spending all this money on a business park, what if we took the $60 million or $30 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5628)|
| 1:33:55| whatever it's going to cost, throwing around numbers out there, to do this business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| what if we bought a laptop computer for every one of Knox County's 56,000 children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5640)|
| 1:34:07| and we provided high-speed Internet access to them to where they could log on to their Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| They couldn't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| They couldn't, you know, it would be a dumb terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| I'm a computer consultant by trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| and so to me that's a logical thing that would make sense for us to do for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| Let's invest in our children and in our workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| and make sure that they have individualized curriculum that would help them really learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| I mean, it's not that difficult to think of other things that could be done for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| I think if you ask most parents today, would you rather see a business park or another business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| or would you rather your child, you know, have a laptop computer and Internet access and an individualized curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| I think I know what they'd say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| What about small business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| If I was a small business person, which, as it happens, I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| why couldn't we say that we were going to take this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| and instead of investing it in a business park for economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| why couldn't we take it and say that we want to start a business roundtable of entrepreneurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| and mentor small businesses and grow them and help them write a business plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| and then fund the best of those plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| That's the real problem here is there's a lack of capital in this area for these kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| There's a lot of ways to do economic development, is my point, and building business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| While I'm sure it is a component, certainly, I'm not discounting that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| but I just think that, you know, that's not necessarily the only way to do economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| and perhaps it's time for us to take a look as a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| and decide how do we want to spend our limited economic dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5749)|
| 1:35:59| I would like to say that a substantial portion of Knox County has already been developed and paved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5759)|
| 1:36:07| and questions I have are how much is enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| How much is fiscally and environmentally sustainable for us to continue to develop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| Does the Development Corporation's vision for Knox County landscape mirror the community's vision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| How does TDC's actions and policies fit Knoxville's goal of becoming a greener, more sustainable community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5785)|
| 1:36:34| The Knox County Urban Growth Plan makes accommodation for growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| but it also makes accommodation for open space and rural agricultural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| One important point, although Knox County funds, funded, and plans to develop this business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5803)|
| 1:36:52| the property actually resides inside the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| Eventually, city council is going to end up dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| If it turns out like the target property, as soon as it's developed, the city will annex it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| So, you know, I just don't know what they were thinking when they selected that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| Placing an employment center on the rural fringe is classic urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| It's not sustainable growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| It moves investment from the inner city core out to the fringe and makes it decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5840)|
| 1:37:27| We already have the infrastructure inside the urban areas, inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| Why are we moving into the county to invest in more infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| It's almost like a child who has plenty of toys, but they're old toys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| And instead, they say, we want that new shiny toy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| They want to play with something new and shiny instead of making do with what they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| One of the things that I've heard TDC claim, and, you know, there's all kinds of things like it changes day to day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5872)|
| 1:38:00| and week to week, what they're going to produce and how many acres of land they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| and what they're doing and what they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| So it's hard to get a handle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| But, you know, they say that they're going to create 5,100 jobs, 5,000 indirect jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5890)|
| 1:38:18| Well, actually, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| I'm quoting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| They're saying that their business parks have created 5,100 direct jobs and 5,000 indirect jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5902)|
| 1:38:31| Well, it took 1,200 acres to produce those 5,100 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| But, you know, those numbers, they're saying they're going to do that with half, less than half of what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5915)|
| 1:38:42| they have at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| They're quoting these numbers and then they're saying numbers that they quoted in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| But we know there's been several major business closures since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| When were the statistics compiled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| and how many jobs are currently active in TDC's industrial parks today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| They should be able to provide us with a list of current employers and employee numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| How many manufacturing jobs are there in 2000 today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| According to the 2009 Knoxville News Sentinel Book of Lists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| only two of the top 100 Knoxville area employers are in a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| What are we going to do with the old business parks that are in decline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| Where is the money going to come from to fix them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| What's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| Does somebody have a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Does anyone have a plan of what to do with Works of the River?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| We have just almost off the top of my head, I can tell you that eight companies have been closed in the last year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5975)|
| 1:39:45| These properties alone have added up to over a million square feet of industrial and business park space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| We've got transmission technologies at Works of the River, Panasonic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| We lost 600 jobs in Works of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Sea Ray, we lost 575 jobs in Works of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| Image Point, we lost 450 jobs downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Phillips, we lost 520 jobs at Straw Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| Anderson News, we lost 400 jobs at Westbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| Goodies, we lost 800 jobs in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| And PBR says they're closing Westbridge location at the end of 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| and they're leaving all their empty spaces behind them, millions of square feet of empty space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6019)|
| 1:40:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| I think one of the key points is, you know, we keep hearing about how we don't have land, we're running out of land, we don't have land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6034)|
| 1:40:41| and their inventory of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| Chris, if you would be so good, give everybody one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6046)|
| 1:40:53| There's a service, the Commercial Information Exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| And the Commercial Information Exchange is kind of like the MLS for commercial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| And so according to the Commercial Insurance Information Exchange last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6064)|
| 1:41:14| there are 2.1 million square feet of empty industrial space that is 10,000 square feet or larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6074)|
| 1:41:23| We threw out everything that's under 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| We spent 2.1 million square feet for sale today, actively listed with a realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6087)|
| 1:41:33| It doesn't count special purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| It doesn't count car washes and churches and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| It doesn't count empty big box retail centers that could be repurposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| And then there's an additional 2 million square feet, over 10,000 square feet each, of space for lease in Knox County today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6104)|
| 1:41:54| There is over 550 acres of industrial or office land that is 10 acres or larger in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6114)|
| 1:42:04| listed actively on the MLS today, over and above the PDC's properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6124)|
| 1:42:11| So it's just a little bit hard for us to believe that they don't have anywhere to put someone if they want to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6131)|
| 1:42:19| You know, I've got a lot of information in here, obviously, that you may want to read and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6139)|
| 1:42:34| I think that, you know, one of the probably biggest issues and questions and concerns that we have is, how is this all going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6154)|
| 1:42:53| The Midway Business Park, you know, Jeff Archer had a slide up there, I think it was on page 71 of his slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| where he said that they had six criteria that they used to select these business parks with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6179)|
| 1:43:06| Well, guess what, guys? Midway Road doesn't meet three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| The three criteria that it doesn't meet were TDC's presentation that they did at Carter High School and the MPC's presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6190)|
| 1:43:18| It doesn't have utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| It doesn't meet a 6% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| And it's not compatible with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| So how can they justify and say this is the right thing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| I would like to know, who are the prospects for this new business park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| And I'd also like to know, what's the difference between a business park and an office park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| Because it sounds to me like with all the constraints of this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6228)|
| 1:43:57| it's going to be on an on-site wastewater system, which their own Mike Hines said that it could only handle domestic waste streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6237)|
| 1:44:07| Domestic waste streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| That means no manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Green Mountain Coffee couldn't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| Confluence Solar couldn't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| Because their processes would prohibit this waste system from working properly if you have a manufacturing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6256)|
| 1:44:26| So, and we're talking about we're not going to do any distribution centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| So, you know, what exactly kind of business is going to go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| It sounds to me like an office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| Well, again, I have new Sentinel articles with quotes and also in the MPC's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| they say that the private sector does office parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| That's not what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| They don't do office parks, but yet that's really kind of like what this sounds like it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| And, you know, really I think that our key problem is we've got over 100 acres at that intersection that's zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6291)|
| 1:45:00| Are you guys prepared to down zone that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| Because how are you going to serve it with wastewater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| If you put an on-site system on to serve the business park, how are you going to tell those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| Are they going to be able to do their own wastewater system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I mean, exactly how are we going to develop that property if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| we're going to let everybody do an on-site wastewater system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| How can we say we're going to control what happens out there and enclose it in this one little thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6324)|
| 1:45:32| when we've got commercial property surrounding it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| I think that government should not be, and I'll conclude here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| Thank you for your indulgence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Government, in my opinion, the Development Corporation has a place at Knox County, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6344)|
| 1:45:53| But government, in my opinion, should not be competing with the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| Government should be doing the hard things that the private sector can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| Specifically, in this case, the Development Corporation should spend its money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| and spend its efforts in the forks of the river and marketing the existing properties that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6367)|
| 1:46:14| and redeveloping our brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| If they're saying that the Panasonic 360,000 square feet building is too large for most people's use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6377)|
| 1:46:24| then buy the property and let's revitalize that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| Let's tear down Panasonic and use that land, which is flat as a pancake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| It's already got all the amenities that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| It's a blight right now on our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| And I'd like to address, you know, they were talking about, well, there's 300 acres in the east sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| that's industrial and there's another 70 acres here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| What about the 1,200 acres at the forks of the river?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6412)|
| 1:47:00| What about East Bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| All of these things are in our sector, in the east county sector already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| So when they talk about balance, I'm really confused about what they mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| Thank you so much for your indulgence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| I'm going to be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| Ms. Davis, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6437)|
| 1:47:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| My name is Elaine Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| I reside at 8003 Thorn Grove Pike in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| I'm the president of the French Broad Preservation Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| and I thank the council for inviting us here for this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| Vice Mayor Becker, thank you for including me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| There's been a lot of points made here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| and I really won't go into great detail about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| I applaud Bob and Lisa for making the points for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| We are here to represent the communities, the people that live in the communities of East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| And one thing that I've noticed here is that I also was on a task force that was put together last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6477)|
| 1:48:06| that included Metropolitan Planning Commission, City Council, and County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| Tony Norman and Joe Holquist were the co-chairs of that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| And it's the Ridgetop and Hillside Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| And I think it's very important that we press forward with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| because part of the things we were doing in that task force were to look at places that we do understand that there is growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6502)|
| 1:48:30| and we do have a growth plan in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| And some of that growth is going to take place in green space in the last rural agricultural area that we have in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6513)|
| 1:48:40| which is East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| And so what we need to do is be very careful of the very thing that brings people here, the beauty of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6522)|
| 1:48:50| And I think that we should put that task force back on its mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| and look at the zoning that we are ready to put in place there before we do anything at Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| Because I do believe that if the zoning restrictions and ordinances that the task force has spent the last two years on came into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6543)|
| 1:49:12| it's going to make a big difference out there at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| And I think this is important enough to stop, put the brakes on, take a deep breath, and say, we need to do this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6555)|
| 1:49:23| This is the last interstate interchange that exists in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| And there is nothing there to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| There's a reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| There is no infrastructure in place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| That's why no one has gone out there and developed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| And I think it's extremely important that we do something that puts Knox County on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| and I think this is the place that we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| I think that that is the most appropriate place for the gateway to the Smoky Mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| the most visited national park in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| We have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| We have that capability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| And I think that Knox County is important enough to do something that makes us stand out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| and gives us recognition in this nation and applauds the reason why people want to come out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6603)|
| 1:50:10| and move to the hills and mountains of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| So my mission is to do the right thing, do the right thing for the East Knox County residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6614)|
| 1:50:22| as well as economic development for this Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| And I would certainly like to open the workshop up and have a question and answer opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| So the only thing I do have is I believe Todd Napier alluded to the French Bud Preservation Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6633)|
| 1:50:41| actually securing an outside source to take a look at what was going on out at Midway through the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| And no one from the Ox Center could be here because our organization did pay for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| and we have to pay for every time he comes up here, and we are just a small community group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| So I will pass their study out so everyone has a copy of it, and I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| Let me open it up for questions from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| I have three questions, if you'll indulge me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| The first one has to do with this issue of a domestic waste stream and an on-site water treatment plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6670)|
| 1:51:19| Mr. Elmore, is that something that you can speak to or one of our engineers that's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| I'd like to understand more about what a domestic waste stream restriction means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| Mike Hines, I think, before I can address that, but I think it might be best for him to take the initial shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| He will be the one responsible for it or has been responsible up until now on engineering design and the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6696)|
| 1:51:44| Mr. Hines, could you explain more about what that means, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| An on-site or decentralized wastewater system cannot handle industrial waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| Now, industrial waste can be defined in any number of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| but we're talking about high-strength waste, chemical waste, plating waste, pharmaceutical waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| this kind of waste that is detrimental to a biological waste treatment system, which is what these systems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6724)|
| 1:52:13| Domestic doesn't mean only waste produced by humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| It's domestic in nature, which means it's food processing waste, as long as it's not terribly high-strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6738)|
| 1:52:27| The coffee roasting that she mentioned couldn't go on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| I checked with another roaster, the ones that I happen to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| and they said, yeah, they produce essentially only domestic waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| There are coffee roasters that do chemical processing of coffee beans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6762)|
| 1:52:48| and that chemical waste may or may not be suitable to go into a system like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6768)|
| 1:52:54| But generally, we're talking about waste that we measure in terms of the organic content, the solid content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| and it is similar to domestic human sewage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| That helps clarify what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| My second question is for, I guess, one of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| Marilyn, before you leave, is that the system they're talking about putting there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| Yeah, a contained system that just serves this business part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| but evidently a contained system like that has a number of restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| and that's what I was trying to clarify is what those restrictions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| and how that relates to the type of businesses that might be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| Let me make one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| It's not just a decentralized system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| If this system was going to connect to the city of Knoxville, I'm sorry, to KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| they would have similar restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| They might be able to handle a stronger waste or even some chemical waste through pretreatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| or through the fact that they have such a huge system that dilution occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| but the KUB system is protected by sewer use ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| which would further restrict the kind of waste that's discharged to their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| It's not just that the kind of system that we're talking about is that much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| It just happens to be smaller and may be more sensitive to those kinds of upsets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| But KUB would have the same concerns about the same kind of waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| A follow-up question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| The chemical plant that we know that's near Alcoa Highway, I think we're supposed to call it Dow now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| It used to be something else, but anyway, Dow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| How do they deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| I assume they have chemical waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| How do they deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| That doesn't go into the KUB system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| I can't answer that because I don't do KUB stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| Mr. Elmore, could you help educate me a little bit on how industrial facilities deal with their waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| Those industrial facilities do indeed discharge to the KUB system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| and it depends in some respects as to the plant that they discharge to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| If that particular plant discharges to our Kauai facility on Maitland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| it is a larger, much more sophisticated plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| so it can handle a different type of waste stream, more variety, more strength of waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6907)|
| 1:55:14| But when it boils right down to it, virtually every industry on our system is subject to certain constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6914)|
| 1:55:21| and we will set standards for those industrial discharges that they have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| And if they can't meet them just through their normal treatment processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| or through their normal production processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| they are required to install what would be considered to be pretreatment to treat their waste to some level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6933)|
| 1:55:41| to make it acceptable to us before they discharge it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| So it's not unheard of for an industry, a large plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| to have special circumstances, special restrictions on their flows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| and for them to do some level of wastewater treatment on site before they discharge it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6954)|
| 1:56:00| And we control that by setting what those standards are that we're willing to accept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| and they then, knowing that, do whatever they have to do on site before they discharge to us to meet those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| So if the Midway Park would go forward, and if it would have this self-contained water treatment plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6972)|
| 1:56:20| are there industries that we could not accept at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| or could those industries do pretreatment on site before it went into the plant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| I guess I'm trying to determine, is this really a limiting factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| or is there a workaround that's fairly common with industry to manage that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| I think technically virtually anything could be located there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| provided they did enough pretreatment to get it down to acceptable levels that we could accept before they discharge it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7005)|
| 1:56:53| But realistically, the larger facilities, the stronger waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| it's not going to be economically feasible for them to take a high-strength waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| and try to treat it on site to then get it down to the level that they could discharge it to us and be acceptable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7022)|
| 1:57:09| So the economics of trying to meet the standards that would be set on a plant such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| is in itself going to be self-limiting for a number of facilities that might want or might consider going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| but would not because of the complexities and costs associated with the pretreatment that would be required of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| And finally, do we have some industries currently in Knox County that are on the KUB system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| that pretreat before they discharge to your system in the way that you're talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| Okay, so we do have some larger industries that produce that kind of waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| Not quite to the narrow level that we're talking about this plant would probably require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| but yes, we do have a number of plants that do pretreat before they discharge to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| And that was obviously economically feasible for them because they're located here and operating here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| Mr. Grieben has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| The size of this plant, how much space does it take up as far as the green space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7081)|
| 1:58:11| However much they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| That's a bad answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| I mean, did we have any idea ahead of time then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| The space requirement is really associated with the drip dispersal field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| and we treat the wastewater to a fairly high quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7104)|
| 1:58:31| and then that wastewater goes to a drip dispersal field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| which would look very much like a lawn irrigation system on a very large scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7114)|
| 1:58:40| And it's underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| And it's underground, like a lawn irrigation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| If we had 10 acres of land, we can handle probably somewhere around 50,000 to 60,000, 70,000 gallons a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7127)|
| 1:59:01| If we had 20 acres, it's double that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| The way the system is going to develop is we're going to look at the land that's available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| trying to use the least valuable land to the business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| and whatever amount of that land is will dictate the size of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7155)|
| 1:59:22| But a rough rule of thumb is that somewhere around 8,000 gallons a day per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7162)|
| 1:59:29| and that can vary depending on the quality of the soils, but say 6,000 to 8,000 gallons a day per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7169)|
| 1:59:36| So if the TDC tells me they want a 60,000-gallon-a-day system, then we're going to look for 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7176)|
| 1:59:44| If they tell me they want a 200,000-gallon-a-day system, we're going to look for that many more acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| But the availability of that land will dictate the size of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| I guess my question is then there's, I forget how many acres are in this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| Can I speak to that just a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| One of the things that we did going into this, and he's kind of looking to some direction from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| is we'd like the ability to, at full build-out, potentially treat up to 200,000 gallons per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| And getting back to Mr. Frotty's question, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| What does that mean, 200,000 gallons per day of waste stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| What does that mean in terms of within how many, I guess, how many square feet of business is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| Okay, so, well, it just depends on the type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| What we did was we looked at Westbridge back in 2006, and pretty much it was full at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7233)|
| 2:00:42| And there's been a few businesses, as Lisa mentioned, that have announced they're going out of business or that have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| And we looked at what their general waste streams were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| And I'd have to go back and look to take that back to square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| And we said, okay, there was, and we even went outside Westbridge at the time and picked up Tom's Food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| And Tom's Food had a huge amount of water that they generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| I mean, compared to everybody else, they dwarfed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| So, back to your point is, there are certain types of companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| even if they can treat their waste level to domestic strength waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| they're not going to be good candidates for this site because they just generate too much waste water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| and you've got to use that much drip field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| It's not practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| The tradeoff's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7287)|
| 2:01:28| So, when I went back to that point, we looked at about 80% of the companies in all of our business parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7288)|
| 2:01:34| treated to a waste stream strength or volume that could go on this system, but there's 20% that can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7294)|
| 2:01:42| So, we're not trying to say that anybody can go there, but most people can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7302)|
| 2:01:51| You know, I can sit down here and look at the list of companies they've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| and there's a lot of them, they're primarily manipulating materials, fabrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| versus a fluid process that could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| And we are thinking that, you know, based on kind of Mike's estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| that we would be setting aside initially up to 25 to 30 acres for the total plant and drip field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7327)|
| 2:02:16| And what we would do would be to develop that in phases so that you start up with around, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| say 30,000 to 50,000 gallons per capacity, and you start developing the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| And then when that starts getting close to looking like it's going to be running out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| then you build phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| We could get to the point, depending on the mix of companies we had up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| if they weren't process fluid oriented, that we could be significantly less than 200,000 gallons per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7357)|
| 2:02:44| But in practical measures, we felt like that was about the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| and we would need to make sure that we didn't have companies that were producing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| one company come in and produce 150,000 gallons unless for some reason they needed the whole park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| I guess what I'm looking at is that you're talking about there's so many acres in the proposed park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| and of that, then you're looking at approximately 30 acres that would be set aside for the drip field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7383)|
| 2:03:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| And what can you use the drip field for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| You know, you can do different things with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| and that's going to be kind of something we're working through with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| If you treat it to a level like there's one I went to in Wilson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7399)|
| 2:03:24| they're using it to irrigate a golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| Most developments went to a couple of residential developments down in Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| and they look like green pasture, but pretty much that's what they look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| So I think it's going to be a matter of what KUB is comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7415)|
| 2:03:41| I know in the state, you know, if you sanitize it, you can have human contact with it, but we're working through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| At this point, we're assuming it's pretty much just kind of a buffer green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| I'll let Ms. Roddy continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| I've got some other questions, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| You still have some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| I was going to follow up on his one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| Is yours a follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| This is a I'm moving away from the water question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| Let me go to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| Can we stay with the water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| Can we stay with the waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| I was trying to understand where we are in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| We've bought some land to the tune of $12 million thereabouts, more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| Less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| Less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| $9.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| $9.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| But it has been bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| I bought the 1,000-second park right after it was rebuilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| How about the wastewater system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| I mean, we're going to have to put in some infrastructure to develop the park so that we'll have the inventory you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7470)|
| 2:04:37| What do we see that's going to come in terms of front-end funding, and I assume that's public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7477)|
| 2:04:43| It's funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| Private dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| We have those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| You have those funds already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| And are they appropriated funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| But they're in your pocket, so to speak, so you're ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| Do you have any idea what the wastewater system would cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| The 30,000 starter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| We have budgeted three up to $4 million to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| Three or $4 million for the wastewater, and then you would add to that roads and some other features?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| Do you have some estimate of what the whole development would cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| Well, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| We've got 9.9 into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| It's the land, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| And then it's going to be about another, say, by the time you get done with phase one, two, and three, another $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7521)|
| 2:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| That includes the wastewater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| Yeah, but the way you would develop this thing is in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| You'd do phase one, then you'd do phase two, and then you'd do phase three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| Like most developments, you'd build enough road and infrastructure to deal with some part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| So is that $20 million total or $30 million total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| It's the 20 additive to the other 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| And, Mr. Hines, the question was raised by some of the folks talking from the communities about there's 70 acres of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7560)|
| 2:06:07| Will you be able to treat that same wastewater in that system, or is that something entirely different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| It's only money and land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| I can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| They were talking about a plant on the 380 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| The plant can handle, if they develop, say, restaurants out on the commercial or stuff like that, the plant can be made to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7580)|
| 2:06:29| It's a KUB decision, a TDC decision, the owner of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| It can be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| Whoever is going to hook to it will probably pay for the expansion, undoubtedly will pay for the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| But your system is one where you basically, you build this treatment thing, and then you need green space to disperse the water when you're done treating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7601)|
| 2:06:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| And so the bigger the system, the more land you need to disperse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| But is the plan, though, isn't the plan just to treat the park itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| We're not talking about, you're not talking about bringing in the commercial or any surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| There again, the limiting factor is land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| And, you know, we'd like, as I said, we would set aside 25 to 30 acres, depending on how the final soils test come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7627)|
| 2:07:16| And then to treat more, and that takes up more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| It's not practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7640)|
| 2:07:21| That's why we've kind of set our limit at being able to treat about 200,000 gallons per day in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| I've got one question, if you all will bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| The total number of acreage is how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| It's about 380.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| 380.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| And we're going to take 30 acres, you say, for the drip field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| Okay, 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| How much land are you taking for roads and other utilities and this sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| I mean, what's your final building footprint out there with the number of businesses you plan to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| Give me a second to look at my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| And while you do that, there's also, I think, is there gas out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| There is gas to the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| There's gas, power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| Water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| How about any other business parks that have been developed on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7686)|
| 2:08:13| Say that in the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| Mr. Pines, would you tell us if you know of any other business parks that have been developed using a system like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7697)|
| 2:08:24| I've got – I manage wastewater plants for Tennessee Wastewater, which is a public utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7704)|
| 2:08:32| We have 38 in operation here in East Tennessee alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| And I'm trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| Like Townsend Town Square and that development down there, there's two in Townsend that are business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7723)|
| 2:08:49| They're nothing of the size that we're talking here, but they're still business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| And how large are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| Well, one of them is 7,500 gallons a day, and the other one is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| No, the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| How large are the business parks that are on –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| A few acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| A few acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| And one of the technologies that we use in the mountains, I went to New England two or three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7748)|
| 2:09:16| and evaluated that technology, and most of the usage was in what we called commercial business park settings, malls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7756)|
| 2:09:29| One of them was a nursing home, residential area setting, but several of them were what I call a business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7769)|
| 2:09:37| mostly strip malls or even large malls, like West Town Mall, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| Let me go back to council questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| I know – I guess Ms. Roddy was next if we finish with the water questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| We can get back to Mr. Napier when he finds the answer to Mr. Graves' question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| The yield's about 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| The final yield's about 350 developable acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7803)|
| 2:10:04| And if you take a drip filled out, you'd be down to another 25 to 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7804)|
| 2:10:12| Mr. Graves, does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| It's about 353 without the drip filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7816)|
| 2:10:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7822)|
| 2:10:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| My second question is, again, for one of the engineers, and it has to do with slope issues on this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7830)|
| 2:10:36| Who was the person that looked at the surveying of the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7836)|
| 2:10:42| Is that you, Mr. Hines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| What was your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| The 8th District Preservation Society brought forward a question about slope on this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| and I've been out to look at it, and like much land in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| it appears to be gently rolling versus the flat as a pancake analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7854)|
| 2:10:59| And so I wondered if someone – who have you used to survey the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7859)|
| 2:11:04| and to assess, you know, the amount of land that's developable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| or that would need further investment to make it appropriate for development in terms of a development site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7868)|
| 2:11:18| The vast majority of this property is well below 6% slope, despite what was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| That was part of the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| We used GIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| We've got topo on minimum of 4-foot contours, maybe even 2-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| The plan is to develop the park in context with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| It's not going to be a mass grade to make one flat site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| So you work with the grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| You go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| We're proposing to put the road at grades that would balance out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7904)|
| 2:11:49| so that we could put sites all up, you know, throughout the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| It's not the aim to try to get this all to one elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| So but the majority of the land is less than a 6% slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| And my final question is for Ms. Rice, and it has to do with education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| I think an important issue was brought up in the presentations to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7930)|
| 2:12:16| and that is how does a community get their arms around the issue of developing the best possible educational system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7936)|
| 2:12:25| And Ms. Starbuck, you know, presented a number of different alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| that if you have money that you can invest in a business park, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| are you better off investing it in individual students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| And I know that probably everybody in this room can agree that the highest quality educational system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| that we can possibly provide for our students and in developing our workforce is of the highest priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| Can you speak to how the education conundrum interfaces with the development of this Midway Business Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7969)|
| 2:12:57| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| I think to Ms. Starbuck's point that education is a critical factor in looking in economic development is absolutely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7981)|
| 2:13:09| Now can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7989)|
| 2:13:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| One of the things I think you have to consider, though, in the context is there's no one silver bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| There's not a silver bullet answer for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| There's not a silver bullet answer for land development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| But what you have to do and what you have to look at is see how these things will, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| coagulate together and how they can make sure that you've got the best possible package in order to present your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8008)|
| 2:13:35| Obviously, we'd love to have computers in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| You could take all the money in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| and have one of the grandest education systems possible probably in this entire country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8019)|
| 2:13:45| But in doing so, where are you going to put those people once that they are educated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| Because, you know, we all have children and education is certainly important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| but we want to make sure that they have opportunities here in East Tennessee when they get out of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| Chamber spends a lot of its time and resources looking at a varied approach to economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8036)|
| 2:14:02| whether that's working with the superintendent in the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| whether it's working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| or whether that's working with small business startups that we have in our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| through the Tennessee Small Business Development Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| which is one of our partners that we fund to help them help small businesses write business plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8053)|
| 2:14:19| to help mentor these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| Education is something that we need, but when you're working with site location specialists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| real estate development professionals from corporate real estate, that's not the first thing they ask you, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8068)|
| 2:14:35| You know, it comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| They want you to have an educated workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| but before they even get to the nitty-gritty of asking you what skill level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| they're going to look to see if you have a location to put their company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| And so it's not one single answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| You have to look at it all as pieces of that puzzle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| and how it goes together to make the best presentation for your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8094)|
| 2:15:01| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| One of the questions that I've been asked or people are cognizant of in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8105)|
| 2:15:12| is the amount of vacant property that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| So how does that fit into your recruitment, if it does or it doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8115)|
| 2:15:22| And then, I mean, I think it's a valid question and something I'd like to hear an answer for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8122)|
| 2:15:29| If I could, I'd like to answer first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| and then if Todd wants to talk about the additional property and land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| You know, much has been said about Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| I'm not sure if this body knows or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| but the development corporation did not develop the Forks of the River Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8140)|
| 2:15:44| That was done by Knox County in the late 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| You know, the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| and the chamber now work with a number of those businesses in that park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8150)|
| 2:15:54| and make sure that we're helping our existing industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| and not only that, but marketing those existing facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| Much has been said about the Panasonic facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| I don't think, you know, we need to lose sight that in the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| when the state worked with Knox County to locate Panasonic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| it was on a piece of vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| That's why they came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| They've expanded four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| We had a buyer for that product in that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| when they announced they were closing out of North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| but the company executives out of Japan refused to cooperate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| and would not sell the process and the facility to this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| They were only two in the United States that do that very specialized aluminum foil process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| We do work with those companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| Green Mountain Coffee, that building that they have gone into sits on 33 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| In my tenure at the chamber, that building has been sold three different times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| with three different tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| And so, you know, to say that we don't market the existing properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| in those facilities, you know, that are available is just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| Unfortunately, you don't have a Green Mountain Coffee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| that can go into an existing facility every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| They were looking for green space, as a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| and we convinced them that they really need to go look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| and then when they looked at their time frame, it worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| It made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| Republic Plastics went into an existing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| We constantly are marketing those facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| but not everybody is willing to go into those vacant buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| But that doesn't mean that we don't continuously market those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| and work with our existing companies when they're in those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| As far as infield and brownfield land development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| fortunately, not only this administration, but the previous administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| had the foresight to know what could happen with the Costa Shop facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8253)|
| 2:17:38| Cisco, which is now sitting there at the heart of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| would not have happened had we not redeveloped that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| and taken that into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| The I-275 property that was mentioned earlier tonight, the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| that available property and that process would not have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| had Cisco and those properties been made available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| Things happen over long periods of time in order to make those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| It's not a silver bullet, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| It's not a short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| And so there are a number of things that we need to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| when we're marketing that, using the resources that we have here in this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| to make sure that people understand what a great location it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| Does the checkerboard effect, I mean, you've got a business here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| the CMT one over here and all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| I mean, does that have an effect on you all, either positive or negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8305)|
| 2:18:29| as opposed to the facility that you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| Well, it's interesting, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| When we first started in going back, I don't recollect going back to 2000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8316)|
| 2:18:43| and this being proposed for the Midway industrial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8323)|
| 2:18:47| I'm going to have to go back and refer to these records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| and I probably have been in this position as long as anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8329)|
| 2:18:57| In the past, we have been very fortunate in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| We haven't had existing inventory on the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| and we've lost projects because we didn't have either land or buildings available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| And everybody talks about they'd like to see the list of our projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| Well, we'd like to be able to share that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| but as your professional economic development agency that you have on contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| we sign nondisclosure and confidentiality forms with these companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| They look to see what's in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| But the C-Ray building right now that just came on the market was very attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| and we have somebody that's interested in looking at that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| And so when they see that, it can have a negative effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| but it also gives you a different type of inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| And so you play all markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| You play the entire check report, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| And I have one last question, and I don't know that it's appropriate, Mr. Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| but there was a lot of things since MPC presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| I don't want to put you all on the spot either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| but I didn't know if it would be appropriate for perhaps them to give maybe at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| or something maybe a five-minute not rebuttal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| but there was a lot of things that were thrown out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| And if you wanted to and if you don't, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| But, you know, at least give the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| And it's not set up that way on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| Sure, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| We have a public forum too, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| We'd like to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8418)|
| 2:20:19| I mean, if you all have that, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| Do you want them to do that now, Mr. Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| Well, I mean, if it's appropriate, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8428)|
| 2:20:32| I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| Mr. Vice Mayor, before they start, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| Mr. Napier, I'll ask my question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| This 380 acres, would that be the largest business park that we have of the present ones that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8443)|
| 2:20:54| East Bridge Business Park, it sits on about 800 total acres, a significant portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8454)|
| 2:21:03| What we have left there is about 195,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| and then there's really one piece that would be very difficult to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| So it's really more like about 165.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| But let's just say it's 195 that's left there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| That's the single largest amount of property left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| The total area when it was bought, it was bought by Knox County back in the late 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8479)|
| 2:21:24| It was offered at a very, very low price by the mine company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| and that's kind of why it's where it is and why it was bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| So this would be the largest park that we would have if it was all developed at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| We would develop it in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8503)|
| 2:21:44| I have some more questions, but I'll let Mr. Carberry go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8509)|
| 2:21:50| I don't refer to what I'm going to be saying here as a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| It's more of a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8513)|
| 2:21:58| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| We published two studies, 2002, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| The first one was on office parks and business park sites, and the second was on business park sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8525)|
| 2:22:11| Those studies aren't done in that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| We had started on the criteria and looking at, through GIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8534)|
| 2:22:21| what made sense as far as business park sites in 2000 before the sector plan was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8541)|
| 2:22:29| I did work with the planner that was in charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| and, you know, we have different entities in MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| and I've said these three sites, and it was three sites that were emerging in East County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| and there was probably roughly 20 sites countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8560)|
| 2:22:44| These aren't done sector by sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| We're looking at the breadth of the county as far as locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| near interchanges, the level of land, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| The six criteria you talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| Yes, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| Yes, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| The criteria are from Urban Land Institute, land use planning professional sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| So, at any rate, there was, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, I don't have the 2002 study in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8586)|
| 2:23:10| but there was essentially three sites that were emerging in 2002 that made some sense as potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8590)|
| 2:23:17| and I'm using the word potential along with these other sites throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| Johnson Road, Breakville, and Midway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| and I said I think we should at least be transparent that we do have this work going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8605)|
| 2:23:31| These would make a good consideration as far as a business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8611)|
| 2:23:35| and ultimately, yes, the Midway was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8615)|
| 2:23:41| It was shown as two office sites and then low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8621)|
| 2:23:48| Going to 2001, and that was after a lengthy process between the city, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| and the town of Farragut on developing the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8634)|
| 2:24:00| the Midway area was, to be honest, a bone of contention between the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| and the city as to where the urban growth boundary was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| and the planned growth boundary was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| The rural area was pretty much set where, through the sector plan process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8649)|
| 2:24:15| and we just pretty much pulled over the rural area at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8655)|
| 2:24:19| But the planned growth area, which is for all intensities of residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8659)|
| 2:24:25| for commercial, for industrial, the range of higher intensity uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8665)|
| 2:24:29| as is the urban growth boundary, did go out to the Midway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8669)|
| 2:24:35| The C4 parcels that you saw earlier were a finger annexation out along the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8675)|
| 2:24:41| to grab those two sites back in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| That's what the Growth Plan Policy Act was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| Let's quit doing finger annexations across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8687)|
| 2:24:51| Those were cards that were dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| Those are kind of like cherry-picking the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| Back in the 90s, cities across Tennessee were going down rivers, annexing rivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8698)|
| 2:25:04| annexing rights-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| We saw it out to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8707)|
| 2:25:08| We saw it out to where North Shore Town Center is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| Anyhow, those sites were Zoned C4 for billboard purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8711)|
| 2:25:17| It's a hard one to take off the table and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| well, that's not going to be commercial anymore when we're doing a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| But Ms. Starbuck mentioned that the business park site was in the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8724)|
| 2:25:33| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8733)|
| 2:25:34| It's in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| The only sites that are out there that's the incorporated area of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| are the commercial sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| What's the difference here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| The reason why we showed the growth policy plan map earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| that blue area is the area under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| and the agreement that the city can begin to annex in without going through annexation fights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8755)|
| 2:26:03| That's the growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| The growth plan has three categories, urban growth boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| which is to meet the expansion needs of the city of Knoxville over a 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8769)|
| 2:26:17| You saw the statistics on that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| It's about a fourth of the area, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| The planned growth area is the area to meet the county's needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8784)|
| 2:26:30| as far as these higher-intensity uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| And the rural area is an area that is to be set aside for agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8793)|
| 2:26:39| forest resource protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| and the future growth needs at some point in the future can be looked at again of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8801)|
| 2:26:49| So it's midway in the growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8809)|
| 2:26:52| It's in both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| And if you look at the map in your plan, you're going to see an incorporated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8814)|
| 2:26:59| You're going to see of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| and you'll see a planned growth boundary that goes out to include the midway site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8822)|
| 2:27:11| The planned growth area that goes out to the business park site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8831)|
| 2:27:19| And then it goes up to Carter School Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8839)|
| 2:27:24| and on the other side of Carter School Road it's all residential with the county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| I mean rural area, and it's all rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8848)|
| 2:27:32| essentially south of the interstate down to the French Broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| And, you know, one of the reasons that we can somewhat shorten sector plan processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8856)|
| 2:27:43| is that the urban growth boundary, planned growth area, rural areas are set in that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8863)|
| 2:27:51| and we as planners can't propose something that's in conflict with that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8871)|
| 2:27:57| So all the recommendations in this plan as far as low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8877)|
| 2:28:02| they're all in keeping with the growth policy plan as it has been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8882)|
| 2:28:11| East Bridge Business Park is in the northeast county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8891)|
| 2:28:17| It was characterized as being in this sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| It's in the northeast county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8899)|
| 2:28:23| Then the MPC did not initiate the rezoning request back in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8903)|
| 2:28:31| In the 2002 meeting before the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| it was a meeting where we provided an overview of all the roughly 20 sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8916)|
| 2:28:42| for potential business parks to discuss with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8922)|
| 2:28:48| It wasn't a proposal that every one of those be a business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| but they all made sense as far as meeting the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| And in our view, quite a few of them make sense today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8936)|
| 2:29:01| We've lost some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| The level land on the south side of the French Broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| that is now going to be Veterans Cemetery was one of those sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| So there's been losses of the sites even since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8951)|
| 2:29:18| And the request in 2006 was an application for heavy industrial zoning at Midway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8958)|
| 2:29:25| and we went, whoa, that's not what is really needed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8965)|
| 2:29:30| And we also said, you know, this needs a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| and that had been brought to their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| We cannot directly go to MPC on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| We need to have a meeting out in the community, and we did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| and various viewpoints were expressed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8986)|
| 2:29:47| Let me go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| I know Mr. Woodhall has to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| We haven't gotten to public forum yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| I know Mr. Brown said you had some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| Do you want to go ahead and do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| One more question, and I'll ask it, I guess, of Mr. Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| Ms. Starbuck mentioned in her remarks about, let me put it like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| of the existing business parks that we have, a lot of this is about jobs, especially to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9006)|
| 2:30:14| How many jobs have been lost over this period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| Do you have any statistics on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| You may not have statistics on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| I don't have statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| Because you're projecting a number of jobs with this new business park, and it's a projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9028)|
| 2:30:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| I'm looking at the situation as jobs versus preservation and trying to have a good balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9036)|
| 2:30:43| I think that's what we're charged to do because nobody is making any more land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9043)|
| 2:30:49| and whatever we do is going to affect the future a long ways off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9049)|
| 2:30:54| But I'm concerned about the idea of jobs because you have an economy that's shaky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9054)|
| 2:31:02| You have jobs that are evaporating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| So I'm concerned about the question I just asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9065)|
| 2:31:12| We've built these business parks to bring in jobs, and some of the jobs have gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9072)|
| 2:31:17| But we don't have any stats on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| But that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9080)|
| 2:31:26| Sure, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9086)|
| 2:31:27| And just to elaborate a little bit on those points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| we will find companies that will locate in the buildings that have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9094)|
| 2:31:42| I think did quite a good job of talking about some of the turnover that's happened already in Forkster River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| And, you know, there was an old Tillman building that was out in Westbridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9107)|
| 2:31:53| and now there's another company in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| So buildings turnover, new jobs come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| Existing buildings don't necessarily meet the needs of every company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9119)|
| 2:32:04| And there are some companies, and I may be wrong about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| Well, let me just back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9128)|
| 2:32:09| So some companies come in and lands what they have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| That's just what they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| And if they're going to consider your community, you need to have a land site that meets their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9134)|
| 2:32:19| And, you know, I don't think economic development, rural preservation necessarily have to be in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| If you do good development in well-thought-out areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| and we just really believe that the interstate interchange along I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| this particular piece is a good location for a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9152)|
| 2:32:36| And we have lost jobs probably to a lesser degree than many of the communities across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9156)|
| 2:32:43| So I think to judge everything on the past two years would be a very short-sighted thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| because business parks are a very long-term proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9167)|
| 2:32:52| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9172)|
| 2:32:53| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9173)|
| 2:32:54| If you could provide that information to all the members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| And I would be more interested in the net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| I mean, I know you're gaining jobs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| I see Mr. Grieven and Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| But first I want to say that one of the things that I'm concerned about is, as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9192)|
| 2:33:18| we're getting volumes of information, and us new folks on the council are just getting into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9198)|
| 2:33:23| And this may take a while for us to really fully understand what's going on, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| But one of the things that concerns me is that part of what we have is we only have so much land left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9209)|
| 2:33:37| And we have an area that, as you were saying, is an interchange that nothing has happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| which is kind of refreshing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| We also have a situation that if we want our city to grow, we've got to have a tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| we've got to have jobs, or we've got to raise taxes, or we've got to have lesser services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9228)|
| 2:33:54| So there's always this kind of conflict that's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| But one of the things that I've been thinking about this whole situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9237)|
| 2:34:01| and this leads up to my questions that I'm going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| is that I sort of think about back in the 70s when we had the downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9244)|
| 2:34:10| and we began to develop shopping centers on the outskirts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9250)|
| 2:34:14| And so we left the core of our city, and it sat empty for, what, 10, 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9254)|
| 2:34:20| until all of a sudden we realized that with not only the fact that we had properties down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| not only the fact that we had vacant properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| but we also had the infrastructure where we could then go back and recreate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9267)|
| 2:34:32| And if you think about what happened back in the 60s and 70s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9272)|
| 2:34:35| and to think about what's happened to downtown right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9275)|
| 2:34:38| you see that all of a sudden we've had a resurgence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| Part of the reason I'm saying this is what I'm concerned about is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9281)|
| 2:34:45| and this gets to my question, is, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9285)|
| 2:34:49| I'd like to know how much vacant office buildings that we have in the city in terms of square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9289)|
| 2:34:56| Ms. Starbucks quoted some figures, and I just wonder if, not to say you're wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9296)|
| 2:35:01| but to have some real facts in terms of what do we have in terms of vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9301)|
| 2:35:06| The same thing goes to in terms of in the different parks that we have that you've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| not only the property that you folks are responsible for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| but the private property out there that's available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| both in terms of business parks and in industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9317)|
| 2:35:22| I'm not sure that I'm familiar enough to know what's happening on the 275 corridor in the Coster Street area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9322)|
| 2:35:29| I know in my own neighborhood where my office is, someone has bought the Baxter Street property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9329)|
| 2:35:34| I don't know how many acres are there, but there's property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| There's infrastructure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| Out along Pellissippi Parkway, there's a lot of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| I don't know what your relationship is or the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| or Knox County's relationship is with the park that I guess is at what, in Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9347)|
| 2:35:53| up towards the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| Do we have some involvement with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| Have we put money into that, and how does that tie in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9356)|
| 2:36:00| And I guess the other thing I look at is, regardless of the fact that the property's already been bought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9360)|
| 2:36:06| but if we're going to spend $20 million on property, does it make more sense to go to Forks of the River?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9366)|
| 2:36:13| I drove out there the other day, and frankly, it's pretty depressing when you drive through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9373)|
| 2:36:18| and see six, seven empty buildings and you see just scattered areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9378)|
| 2:36:23| Would it make sense to go, and even though that's privately owned now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| is to go and buy that property up and develop that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| Is that a desirable place to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| So there's a number of things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9393)|
| 2:36:37| Number one is how much property is available in our city and in our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9397)|
| 2:36:44| both from the standpoint of office parks and industrial areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| and then how do these other areas tie in to what the development corporation is doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9407)|
| 2:36:53| So that's questions that I'd like to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9413)|
| 2:36:57| That might be for MPC as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| Well, maybe MPC can help us on that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9418)|
| 2:37:03| Yeah, if I could respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| We do periodic industrial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| Before I forget, Mark, let me just throw in one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| Excuse me for interrupting, but I have no idea what the orange route is going to do to us either in terms of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9429)|
| 2:37:15| Is there one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| Is there going to be one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| And if so, what does that do to the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| We could do a workshop if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| Being it at 730, we may have to continue this workshop another time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9444)|
| 2:37:27| because it's obvious that I'm not sure that I'm going to get all the answers that I need to make a good decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9447)|
| 2:37:33| This is so critical for the future of our city and so crucial to the future of our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| and it's not as though that – I don't think this is an easy decision and a quick decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9458)|
| 2:37:45| Excuse me, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9465)|
| 2:37:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9467)|
| 2:37:48| MPC periodically does industrial space inventories and office space inventories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9468)|
| 2:37:54| I have with me our latest industrial space inventory, which was published in March of 2008 with 2007 data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9474)|
| 2:38:04| I believe the latest office one is a year fresher than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| It's available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| You can look at it or download it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| But we do extensive surveys of all of the spaces that we know about on a sector-by-sector basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9493)|
| 2:38:21| So you can look at the central city and compare it to the northwest county or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9501)|
| 2:38:27| So we can – I mean, that information is available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| I thought maybe someone had it offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| But the thing I want to go back to about the redevelopment of downtown, thinking of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9512)|
| 2:38:38| I think all of us need to remember that we have these buildings sitting downtown that have been redeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| and they weren't done necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| In other words, the people who have moved into those buildings and the offices and the business took what was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| and modified them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9530)|
| 2:38:51| You know, you had mentioned earlier about the fact that, well, a lot of the buildings and places we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9531)|
| 2:38:55| that someone wants new buildings or new spaces or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9535)|
| 2:38:58| I think a lot depends on how we market those and how desirable we make those buildings to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9538)|
| 2:39:05| to be able to convert them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9545)|
| 2:39:06| And apparently Green Mountain Coffee is a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| It's a successful project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| And if C-rate boats can turn over, I think that's fantastic and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9551)|
| 2:39:15| So I know you folks are doing that, but I think we have to look at here's $20 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| and here's the future and how do we tie all this together on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9559)|
| 2:39:25| I don't disagree there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| And we're very involved in looking for opportunities to help revitalize areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9567)|
| 2:39:34| Rhonda talked about the old Coster Yard and what Cisco is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9574)|
| 2:39:37| Through the Industrial Development Board, who the Development Corporation is staffed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9577)|
| 2:39:41| we've got the 19.5 acres on Baxter Avenue, former Brookside Mill site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9581)|
| 2:39:46| And we're working with the city to try to then continue to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| We did a study, I guess it was in 2008, looking for sites more within the urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9590)|
| 2:39:57| And we identified a bunch of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| And there's just not as many as people seem to think there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9599)|
| 2:40:05| And we're aware of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9605)|
| 2:40:08| So that is not being ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| Can we get copies of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| Do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| We have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9616)|
| 2:40:19| We can make it available in one form or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| And so to that end, you know, we are working in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9622)|
| 2:40:27| It's not going to work for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| And what we are saying is there is no one answer to economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9629)|
| 2:40:35| Education is part of it, entrepreneurial development, workforce skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| You know, downtown revitalizations, reusing existing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9640)|
| 2:40:45| But land is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| And you cannot ignore this until it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9651)|
| 2:40:52| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9652)|
| 2:40:53| But I guess, Mark, here's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| As a council person who gets phone calls about this whole issue, you know, we all know it's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9655)|
| 2:41:00| And a lot of people are involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| And, you know, I get phone calls that say, well, you know, they're talking about buying this land out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9662)|
| 2:41:06| But look, there's Coster Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9666)|
| 2:41:07| There's Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| You know, all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9669)|
| 2:41:10| What I'd like to do is if I can give you some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| I don't want to have to wade through all of this, you know, information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| In other words, what I'd like to know is to get answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9676)|
| 2:41:19| Dwayne, that cost me $7 for that copy you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| I tell you what, I don't even know what I've done with your copy, but here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| Oh, I don't want it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9688)|
| 2:41:29| I want you to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| I'll take good care of it, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| But, you know, if we could get, if some of us can come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9693)|
| 2:41:37| maybe the rest of you have all the answers, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| But if I can come up with questions like I've come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| and if it can be summarized to where I don't have to go through all these maps and all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9702)|
| 2:41:46| that would be extremely helpful to me, Mr. Mayor, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9706)|
| 2:41:49| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| Mr. Delavaux, and then Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| First, I want to thank everyone that's come here because you've done a wonderful job in providing us information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9715)|
| 2:42:00| And it is an important question to the community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| So I do appreciate you taking the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| And I guess I apologize that we're so dense sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| We may not know some of the things that seem obvious to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| But what no one has said explicitly but is clearly the invisible 800-pound or 8,000-pound gorilla in the room is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9731)|
| 2:42:21| if this business park develops, does it not create the pressures that destroy the surrounding areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9741)|
| 2:42:30| as kind of low-density, rural, I grew up here and raised my family on a farm kind of community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9750)|
| 2:42:39| And that's kind of the question that I keep asking myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| that the self-contained unit for dealing with wastewater certainly, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9762)|
| 2:42:47| enhances that in terms of trying to keep it compact and in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9767)|
| 2:42:55| And I can appreciate that you guys have looked long and hard at the topographic and land-based things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9775)|
| 2:43:01| that pick out sites that are big enough to develop in a rational way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| That's an important thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9787)|
| 2:43:08| But what do we say about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9788)|
| 2:43:11| Once the door is open, so to speak, what happens to the folks that have chosen a rural lifestyle in those kind of areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9791)|
| 2:43:20| Does it not necessarily throw open the doors to development that wants to move in around it and take advantage of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9800)|
| 2:43:27| Maybe that's not a fair question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| Maybe it's for the planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9808)|
| 2:43:29| I don't know who it's to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9809)|
| 2:43:30| But no one's really said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9810)|
| 2:43:31| But that's kind of a lot of the pressures and the phone calls you receive are about that very issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9811)|
| 2:43:38| is that, you know, my family, Pappy and Grandpappy and whatnot, all the way back 200 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| have been farming land out here, and all of a sudden we're going to be in a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| And so could you talk to that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| And I think you're a far cry from being in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| This is interstate frontage property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| That's a big asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9838)|
| 2:43:59| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9839)|
| 2:44:00| I mean, so let's say at least half of this is bounded by interstate 40, 90,000 cars a day go past this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9840)|
