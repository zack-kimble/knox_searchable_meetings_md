| 3:46:30| And whatever they may do on those various subject matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13590)|
| 3:46:34| you do not and we do not presently know what that will be or how they will go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13594)|
| 3:46:41| Yet if you act today, you will be deemed to have approved whatever it is they may do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13601)|
| 3:46:49| A note, for example, provisions that say things like the committee is to review interim financial reports with management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13609)|
| 3:47:01| consider whether they are complete and consistent with information known to committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13621)|
| 3:47:09| just to resolve disagreements between management and auditors regarding financial reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13629)|
| 3:47:18| The committee will invite members of management, auditors, and others to attend meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13638)|
| 3:47:26| and provide pertinent information as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13646)|
| 3:47:31| And sort of that list goes on as far as those utilization of those kind of terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13651)|
| 3:47:42| I mentioned it and I'm going to go back and cover it just briefly in the section labeled compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13662)|
| 3:47:49| You are granting to the committee the power to establish procedures for receipt, retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13669)|
| 3:47:54| and treatment of complaints received from anybody, about pretty much anybody in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13674)|
| 3:48:01| including employees regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13681)|
| 3:48:08| and that includes submission of, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13688)|
| 3:48:11| concerns, close quote, regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13691)|
| 3:48:17| I suggest that while I say I'm not here in opposition to this committee being created and it having authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13697)|
| 3:48:27| but I am very, very interested, as I think we all should be, on getting it done right to start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13707)|
| 3:48:35| and getting this body's involvement in setting the parameters more so than simply leaving it up to the committee to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13715)|
| 3:48:44| in essence, self-initiate and self-control, if you will, what they are going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13724)|
| 3:48:51| and how they're going to go about doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13731)|
| 3:48:54| Are they to establish a hearing process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13734)|
| 3:48:58| Will they compel responses or attendance at their meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13738)|
| 3:49:03| Will they initiate audits by request of the county auditor or others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13743)|
| 3:49:08| And for those additional functions or procedures that they may authorize, how are they to be paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13748)|
| 3:49:16| and how is there to be any control exerted over the cost of those things occurring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13756)|
| 3:49:23| You have one minute, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13763)|
| 3:49:25| I think having said that, and as I pointed out to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13765)|
| 3:49:29| it's very difficult to go through word by word what's in this charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13769)|
| 3:49:35| and try to hammer all that out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13775)|
| 3:49:38| I, for one, would hope that this matter could be postponed for further consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13778)|
| 3:49:44| and an opportunity provided by perhaps hosted by your law director for those of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13784)|
| 3:49:51| who are interested to have an opportunity to sit down and try to work out some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13791)|
| 3:49:57| I think it's probably about 80% there, but those questions are very nagging and difficult questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13797)|
| 3:50:03| I would also hope that, and again, I don't speak for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13803)|
| 3:50:06| but I would hope that if invited some of the county officeholders might like to be present at such a meeting for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13806)|
| 3:50:15| if you will, having opportunity for input on the subject matter also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13815)|
| 3:50:19| Having said all that, I appreciate the opportunity to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13819)|
| 3:50:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13822)|
| 3:50:25| Chief Rubel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13825)|
| 3:50:28| Mike Rubel from the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13828)|
| 3:50:30| I don't want to be redundant with what John has already said, but my concerns are basically the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13830)|
| 3:50:35| This audit committee is basically two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13835)|
| 3:50:37| Part of it is audit and part of it is an investigatory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13837)|
| 3:50:40| We have no objection to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13840)|
| 3:50:42| That is part of your responsibility as the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13842)|
| 3:50:46| You have the right under the charter to have an annual audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13846)|
| 3:50:49| You have the right under the charter to have special audits any time you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13849)|
| 3:50:53| That's your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13853)|
| 3:50:53| But in this charter, if you read it on the second page, we start talking about an investigatory function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13853)|
| 3:51:00| This charter gives this committee the power to investigate, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13860)|
| 3:51:04| significant accounting and reporting issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13864)|
| 3:51:06| Well, somebody define for me, because it's not in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13866)|
| 3:51:10| what is a significant accounting and reporting issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13870)|
| 3:51:14| What do you do if you find it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13874)|
| 3:51:17| Is it an issue that ten commission members think is significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13877)|
| 3:51:20| and therefore subject to an investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13880)|
| 3:51:22| Is it a single member of the charter of the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13882)|
| 3:51:25| Is it a single member of this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13885)|
| 3:51:27| You need some definition, and that is exactly what I believe Mr. King was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13887)|
| 3:51:32| The second part is on page five in their compliance section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13892)|
| 3:51:35| They talk about questionable accounting procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13895)|
| 3:51:39| Any complaints involve questionable accounting procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13899)|
| 3:51:42| Everybody wants those investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13902)|
| 3:51:44| But what is a questionable accounting procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13904)|
| 3:51:46| Is it something that violates the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13906)|
| 3:51:48| Is it something that violates our procurement code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13908)|
| 3:51:50| Is it something that violates state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13910)|
| 3:51:52| There needs to be definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13912)|
| 3:51:54| And, again, I don't want to keep beating the dead horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13914)|
| 3:51:56| but as Mr. King pointed out, we have no objection to an audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13916)|
| 3:52:00| We have no objection to there being an audit committee with some teeth in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13920)|
| 3:52:05| This charter is incomplete with regard to how those investigations are going to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13925)|
| 3:52:11| Some of you all have been through the recent ethics committee issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13931)|
| 3:52:14| where there was a failure in the procedures of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13934)|
| 3:52:16| or at least a perceived failure for there to be these kinds of procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13936)|
| 3:52:20| or safeguards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13940)|
| 3:52:21| What standards are the employees being judged against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13941)|
| 3:52:25| What kind of investigation are we going to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13945)|
| 3:52:28| Are my employees, excuse me, not my employees, are my coworkers going to be called to the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13948)|
| 3:52:33| and be sworn in and have subpoenas issued for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13953)|
| 3:52:36| Do they have a right to counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13956)|
| 3:52:38| At whose cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13958)|
| 3:52:39| Those are issues that you need to define before you have one of these investigations go forward, not after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13959)|
| 3:52:45| And those rules need to be made by you and not left up to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13965)|
| 3:52:49| And in their compliance section, that's specifically what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13969)|
| 3:52:53| They say they will set rules with regard to the receipt and retention and treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13973)|
| 3:52:59| I think is the phrase they use, of these kinds of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13979)|
| 3:53:03| And that should be unacceptable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13983)|
| 3:53:06| It should be unacceptable to you that we don't know how those things are going to be handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13986)|
| 3:53:11| or against what standards we are going to be judged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13991)|
| 3:53:16| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13996)|
| 3:53:17| Be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13997)|
| 3:53:18| I think Mr. King is probably here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=13998)|
| 3:53:20| We're not objecting to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14000)|
| 3:53:21| We've been audited every year since I've been in the sheriff's office, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14001)|
| 3:53:25| We've passed them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14005)|
| 3:53:26| That's not what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14006)|
| 3:53:27| This is about the second prong of this little charter, which is this perceived investigatory arm that you may want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14007)|
| 3:53:35| but you need to reel in and you need to make the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14015)|
| 3:53:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14018)|
| 3:53:41| Mr. Ruble, you introduced some items that you would like to have seen introduced to the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14021)|
| 3:53:47| and they were not even considered, I don't think, at the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14027)|
| 3:53:51| Would you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14031)|
| 3:53:53| Well, when I say they weren't considered, I think that the chair, the law director's office provided a copy of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14033)|
| 3:54:00| I don't think they got them laid in a meeting, and I don't think they were able to be fully vetted in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14040)|
| 3:54:06| I received an e-mail that was forwarded to me from Mr. Carcello that seemed to explain some of the issues I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14046)|
| 3:54:12| did not explain others of the issues that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14052)|
| 3:54:15| And I think part of this problem is that we seem to have ceded the responsibility for defining the parameters of the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14055)|
| 3:54:22| committee to the audit committee itself, and I'm not sure that's a good procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14062)|
| 3:54:26| And what I'm suggesting here today, and you all can, you know, obviously I don't like people telling me I do my job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14066)|
| 3:54:31| you do your job the way you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14071)|
| 3:54:33| But it seems to me that with a little more effort at the draftsmanship stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14073)|
| 3:54:38| that you won't have people that are representing the county-wide standing down here arguing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14078)|
| 3:54:43| You'll have us saying we'll go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14083)|
| 3:54:45| We are all transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14085)|
| 3:54:46| We are all subject to your audits at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14086)|
| 3:54:50| One question I have, and I don't know who would answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14090)|
| 3:54:52| it's on the authority in their charter here that says the audit committee is empowered to appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14092)|
| 3:54:59| compensate, or CO oversee the work of the public accounting firms employed by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14099)|
| 3:55:04| Do they have the right to set the fees that these people will be charging?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14104)|
| 3:55:10| Who would answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14110)|
| 3:55:12| I think Mr. Carcello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14112)|
| 3:55:15| Let's ask Dr. Joe Carcello, the chair of the audit committee, to come forward and talk about the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14115)|
| 3:55:21| Before, excuse me just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14121)|
| 3:55:27| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14127)|
| 3:55:29| I need to make a comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14129)|
| 3:55:32| I'm a member of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14132)|
| 3:55:34| Let me disclose that at the beginning of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14134)|
| 3:55:37| I'm a member of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14137)|
| 3:55:40| Commissioner Saunders is a member of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14140)|
| 3:55:43| And the most important third leg of the audit committee is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14143)|
| 3:55:50| The audit committee is composed of five people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14150)|
| 3:55:55| The majority of the audit committee are sitting here with you as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14155)|
| 3:56:02| We are directed by commission to do what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14162)|
| 3:56:07| We're not doing these things that are being talked about in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14167)|
| 3:56:13| We've brought every decision that was to be made as far as auditing go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14173)|
| 3:56:22| It's been approved here in the big room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14182)|
| 3:56:25| The question about compensation, whatever the other two or three words there were, they're approved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14185)|
| 3:56:34| They're not approved in the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14194)|
| 3:56:38| If you want a peer review, you ask for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14198)|
| 3:56:42| and it only takes us six or seven months to get it done to the point that we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14202)|
| 3:56:48| But full commission asks for it, and it's taken us this long to get to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14208)|
| 3:56:56| And now we're beginning to have cold feet about what's going on because the audit committee has ran wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14216)|

| 3:59:18| And to try to assassinate Mr. Carcello's reputation before we even have a chance to discuss what's taking place in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14358)|
| 3:59:29| audit committee, of which I'm a member, of which Commissioner Saunders is a member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14369)|
| 3:59:39| Commissioner Shouse, who is not here to enter into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14379)|

| 3:59:49| If you have no confidence in what the audit committee is doing, that's what we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14389)|
| 3:59:54| We don't need to talk about any of these other things until we get agreement that commission likes the three commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14394)|
| 4:00:01| that are on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14401)|
| 4:00:03| If you think we need to be doing something different, then take all the stuff that I've said so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14403)|
| 4:00:09| Push it to the side and tell us what it is that we on the audit committee are supposed to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14409)|
| 4:00:13| because I think we've been doing a good job about what it is that we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14413)|
| 4:00:17| I've done it in the best interest of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14417)|
| 4:00:20| I've done it in the best interest of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14420)|
| 4:00:24| So let's back up for a moment and let me collect myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14424)|
| 4:00:29| and let's talk about what it is that we need to be doing as far as looking at numbers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14429)|
| 4:00:38| Now, if Dr. Cosello is coming to the podium, I present Dr. Cosello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14438)|
| 4:00:44| First let me say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14444)|
| 4:00:45| First of all, pardon me, I'd like to hear the answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14445)|
| 4:00:48| I didn't get the answer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14448)|
| 4:00:51| You asked the appointment compensating, who's to pay that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14451)|
| 4:00:56| Who has the authority to okay that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14456)|
| 4:00:58| Full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14458)|
| 4:01:00| That's not what this charter says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14460)|
| 4:01:02| I think Commissioner Wright has invited Dr. Cosello to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14462)|
| 4:01:06| I think he should be given the right to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14466)|
| 4:01:09| Commissioner Wright had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14469)|
| 4:01:11| No, I think I had it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14471)|
| 4:01:12| Commissioner Harmon had the floor and never had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14472)|
| 4:01:14| I'm making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14474)|
| 4:01:15| I want to hear from Dr. Cosello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14475)|
| 4:01:16| First of all, I'm going to say I wasn't here to assassinate anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14476)|
| 4:01:19| I just had some questions, and I think I answered them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14479)|
| 4:01:21| I don't know Dr. Cosello, and I'm sure he's a great teacher at UT, and I respect him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14481)|
| 4:01:25| So I hate the thought of him thinking I was going to assassinate somebody because I'm not armed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14485)|
| 4:01:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14494)|
| 4:01:36| Joe Cosello, 1921 Blackheath Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14496)|
| 4:01:40| I won't take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14500)|
| 4:01:42| I've already sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14502)|
| 4:01:43| Well, first of all, let me clarify one thing as it relates to what Deputy Mike Rubel said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14503)|
| 4:01:50| I didn't take anything that he said as a criticism of me or of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14510)|
| 4:01:55| I think his concerns are legitimate in terms of what he believes, and I think we can work with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14515)|
| 4:02:04| I do think it's important that the charter be approved today for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14524)|
| 4:02:10| I've sent this commission two documents, one a quite lengthy document that you should have gotten this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14530)|
| 4:02:18| that responded to a number of complaints that were filed with the commission last Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14538)|
| 4:02:25| and obviously I won't go through about a 60-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14545)|
| 4:02:29| But one of the things that I talk about is the audit committee charter in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14549)|
| 4:02:33| Hopefully you've had a chance to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14553)|
| 4:02:36| The other thing I would point out, and I think this is important, I spent some time over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14556)|
| 4:02:42| non-compensated Mr. Harmon, looking at state law, Tennessee state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14562)|
| 4:02:50| And the state of Tennessee passed an act in 2005 called the Audit Committee Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14570)|
| 4:02:56| which requires the creation of audit committees for those entities that have governing boards, councils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14576)|
| 4:03:01| commissions, or equivalent bodies that can hire and terminate employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14581)|
| 4:03:05| and are responsible for the preparation of financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14585)|
| 4:03:09| My read of that suggested that this commission is bound by that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14589)|
| 4:03:14| I spoke with Joe Jarrett this morning, since I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14594)|
| 4:03:19| He confirmed to me that, in fact, commission is bound by that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14599)|
| 4:03:23| So once, if you accept that, then I actually dug into the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14603)|
| 4:03:29| And this is on the desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14609)|
| 4:03:31| Commissioner Wright was kind enough to distribute this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14611)|
| 4:03:34| I worked on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14614)|
| 4:03:35| I worked on this this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14615)|
| 4:03:36| It's only a three-page document, one page of language and then two pages of attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14616)|
| 4:03:43| And if you look at the actual law, the text of the law, section four of the law indicates that an audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14623)|
| 4:03:51| this is exhibit one, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14631)|
| 4:03:53| An audit committee created pursuant to this chapter shall develop a written charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14633)|
| 4:03:58| Now, the commission should vote to approve the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14638)|
| 4:04:00| and you certainly have the right to not approve the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14640)|
| 4:04:04| I mean, that's your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14644)|
| 4:04:05| But it's the responsibility of the audit committee to develop its own charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14645)|
| 4:04:09| I should point out to you, just for full information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14649)|
| 4:04:11| if you haven't had the chance to read the document that I sent to you over the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14651)|
| 4:04:15| I guess that was sent to you this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14655)|
| 4:04:18| The original versions of the charter were drafted by Richard Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14658)|
| 4:04:23| And the first probably two, three, four versions of that were drafted by him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14663)|
| 4:04:28| And I was completely inconstant with him, as were the other members of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14668)|
| 4:04:35| as to what the charter said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14675)|
| 4:04:38| We had the charter vetted by the Tennessee Comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14678)|
| 4:04:43| And the Comptroller made some recommendations that we incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14683)|
| 4:04:47| We had the charter vetted with KPMG, which is our external auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14687)|
| 4:04:50| and an international public accounting firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14690)|
| 4:04:53| KPMG made some recommendations, which we incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14693)|
| 4:04:56| We worked very closely with Mr. Jarrett and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14696)|
| 4:05:00| and recommendations that he made we incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14700)|
| 4:05:03| We've been working on this charter for virtually a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14703)|
| 4:05:07| We had our first meeting in October of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14707)|
| 4:05:09| This is September of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14709)|
| 4:05:12| We could continue to work on the charter for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14712)|
| 4:05:15| It's a written document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14715)|
| 4:05:16| It's never going to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14716)|
| 4:05:17| It's never going to make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14717)|
| 4:05:20| I think on balance, it's a very good audit committee charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14720)|
| 4:05:24| The other thing I would point out, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14724)|
| 4:05:26| Mr. Rubel was concerned, I think rightly so, about the investigation piece of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14726)|
| 4:05:33| This isn't something we really wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14733)|
| 4:05:36| I suggest you call the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14736)|
| 4:05:39| The Tennessee General Assembly passed a law this year, and Mr. Jarrett can speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14739)|
| 4:05:44| and the governor signed, that requires audit committees to be the body that handle allegations anonymously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14744)|
| 4:05:54| that deal with accounting and auditing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14754)|
| 4:05:59| I'm not looking for extra work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14759)|
| 4:06:01| Trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14761)|
| 4:06:03| But that was a law passed by the General Assembly signed by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14763)|
| 4:06:08| So that's where that piece comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14768)|
| 4:06:12| The other thing I would point out to you, and I think this is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14772)|
| 4:06:16| is everything we have done since we've been in existence has been unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14776)|
| 4:06:21| Sixty percent of the group is you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14781)|
| 4:06:25| Ms. Kaiser and I are there just to provide technical advice and counsel, really, to Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14785)|
| 4:06:32| and Commissioner Saunders and Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14792)|
| 4:06:36| Many of you have attended some or all of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14796)|
| 4:06:40| At least four or five of the commissioners have attended one or more meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14800)|
| 4:06:47| On some of our meetings where I knew we had particularly contentious issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14807)|
| 4:06:51| if you recall I sent personal e-mails to each of you inviting you to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14811)|
| 4:06:58| So this is hardly a group that's reaching for power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14818)|
| 4:07:03| This is a group that's trying to serve you and the citizens of Knox County in an effective manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14823)|
| 4:07:10| That's all I have to say about the charter, but I'm happy to take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14830)|
| 4:07:17| Are there any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14837)|
| 4:07:20| You know, Dr. Carsello here, he said it is important, this is from you, it is important for commission to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14840)|
| 4:07:27| that an audit committee exists to oversee audits, internal and external.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14847)|
| 4:07:32| I'm not against that one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14852)|
| 4:07:35| But I would like an answer to a question or to your authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14855)|
| 4:07:40| The audit committee is empowered to appoint, compensate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14860)|
| 4:07:44| and oversee the work of the public accounting firms employed by Knox County to conduct the annual audits subject to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14864)|
| 4:07:50| requirements of the Knox County Charter and ordinances of the Knox County Procurement Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14870)|
| 4:07:55| or other applicable local, state, and federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14875)|
| 4:07:58| These firms will report directly to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14878)|
| 4:08:02| Now, who appoints and compensates that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14882)|
| 4:08:07| Would that be the audit committee in the pay of these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14887)|
| 4:08:12| Well, Commissioner Pinkston, what we've done since we've been existing, in existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14892)|
| 4:08:18| we've had two instances where we've had to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14898)|
| 4:08:22| The first instance, which I guess we'll discuss later, is on the peer review of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14902)|
| 4:08:27| And the second is on the payroll audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14907)|
| 4:08:30| In both cases, we closely followed Knox County purchasing procedures, worked with Mr. Hoyt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14910)|
| 4:08:36| and Mr. Reeves, worked with Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14916)|
| 4:08:39| We did an RFP as required by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14919)|
| 4:08:42| We got bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14922)|
| 4:08:44| We evaluated the fee as part of that bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14924)|
| 4:08:47| We made a recommendation as to what we thought was the best firm, including price, to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14927)|
| 4:08:55| We're not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14935)|
| 4:08:57| And so we make a recommendation to commission as to we think you should hire this firm, and here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14937)|
| 4:09:04| In both cases, both as it relates to the peer review and as it relates to the payroll audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14944)|
| 4:09:09| commission is the body that acted to retain those firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14949)|
| 4:09:12| and I don't envision that that would change in any way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14952)|
| 4:09:19| You appoint, this is the audit committee, appoint and compensate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14959)|
| 4:09:26| That would mean pay, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14966)|
| 4:09:28| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14968)|
| 4:09:29| That means that we would be turning over the power for you to appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14969)|
| 4:09:33| and pay these people without any approval from commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14973)|
| 4:09:37| Is that not right with this charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14977)|
| 4:09:39| I don't think that's right because I believe Mr. Jarrett added language that indicates that we would have that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14979)|
| 4:09:44| within the parameters of the existing Knox County purchasing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14984)|
| 4:09:51| Well, when we get back to the Knox County in-person control here, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=14991)|
| 4:10:00| The audit committee shall cooperate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15000)|
| 4:10:02| and assist the purchasing department in the development of the RFP for external audit services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15002)|
| 4:10:08| The audit committee shall review all proposals and select an audit firm for recommendation to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15008)|
| 4:10:14| for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15014)|
| 4:10:15| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15015)|
| 4:10:16| Some of these things are a little strong, it seems to me like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15016)|
| 4:10:20| You know, I understand that, Mr. Wright, if you want to talk or whichever one of y'all is talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15020)|
| 4:10:27| But what I'm saying is it seems to me like that we're giving you just a little bit much power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15027)|
| 4:10:32| too much power here when you yourself say that it is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15032)|
| 4:10:37| and we're not wanting to take away a committee to oversee the audits internal and external.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15037)|
| 4:10:43| I think that's what you should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15043)|
| 4:10:44| But we're having to even change the rules, committee here, break some rules to change these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15044)|
| 4:10:49| We've got to change, I would think we would have to, I'm not a law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15049)|
| 4:10:55| amending section 2-277 regarding staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15055)|
| 4:10:59| We're going to have to do a lot of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15059)|
| 4:11:02| But it seems to me like that if we aren't careful that we're giving this audit committee so much power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15062)|
| 4:11:11| and you're not accountable to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15071)|
| 4:11:13| No, we're accountable to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15073)|
| 4:11:15| I mean, at any time, a commission could disband the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15075)|
| 4:11:21| They could replace the members of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15081)|
| 4:11:25| In my mind, we're directly accountable to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15085)|
| 4:11:28| If we're required by state law to have an audit committee, how can we disband it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15088)|
| 4:11:32| Well, you could replace the people on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15092)|
| 4:11:35| But you're appointed for so how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15095)|
| 4:11:37| I believe it's two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15097)|
| 4:11:38| Two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15098)|
| 4:11:39| One year is already gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15099)|
| 4:11:42| You can serve two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15102)|
| 4:11:45| The question is, no, I'll let that go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15105)|
| 4:11:47| No, I'll let that go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15107)|
| 4:11:50| Are there any other questions for Dr. Costello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15110)|
| 4:11:54| I do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15114)|
| 4:11:55| Unless somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15115)|
| 4:11:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15116)|
| 4:11:57| Dr. Costello, the concerns that I'm hearing, I mean, you spoke about them briefly earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15117)|
| 4:12:05| is the power for somebody to come up and just come to the audit committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15125)|
| 4:12:10| and say, I think elected official A has taken money under the table in his office or her office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15130)|
| 4:12:18| and I want you to audit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15138)|
| 4:12:21| Before you begin an audit, do you have to come to us and say, do we do an audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15141)|
| 4:12:27| Or what would the procedure be if you got a complaint from a citizen that left their name, not anonymous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15147)|
| 4:12:32| not whistleblower, just a citizen that come to you for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15152)|
| 4:12:36| They complain publicly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15156)|
| 4:12:37| They complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15157)|
| 4:12:38| And they come to the audit committee meeting and state to you that they would like that done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15158)|
| 4:12:42| It would depend on if it was an internal or an external audit, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15162)|
| 4:12:47| If it was an external audit, we would have to do an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15167)|
| 4:12:52| and ultimately commission would have to approve any expenditure of funds to hire an outside firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15172)|
| 4:12:58| If it was an internal audit, presumably the way it should work is we would work with the director of internal audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15178)|
| 4:13:06| and if there was merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15186)|
| 4:13:10| Now, again, the thing that you're kind of leaving out is there are five members on the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15190)|
| 4:13:17| and we haven't done anything that wasn't unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15197)|
| 4:13:20| And so, as evidenced by this body, getting unanimous agreement is not so easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15200)|
| 4:13:25| But everything that we've done has been unanimous, and it hasn't been difficult to get unanimous decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15205)|
| 4:13:31| So my sense would be the way we've operated at least to date is unless the citizen had very credible information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15211)|
| 4:13:41| there's no way there would be unanimous vote on that group to even talk to the director of internal audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15221)|
| 4:13:47| about doing an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15227)|
| 4:13:48| I think we're all very sensitive that audits can be used for political purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15228)|
| 4:13:55| They can be used as witch hunts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15235)|
| 4:13:58| And I think you've got to be very, very sensitive to that and only initiate an audit if there's good reason to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15238)|
| 4:14:06| And based on the charter, can you initiate an audit without commission's approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15246)|
| 4:14:11| An internal audit we probably could, but the internal auditor can do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15251)|
| 4:14:15| And currently, I guess my question would be the internal auditor, and, Richard, you can pop up if you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15255)|
| 4:14:23| From what I understand, talking to Richard this week, there's a new state law that says an internal audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15263)|
| 4:14:29| until complete, is not public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15269)|
| 4:14:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15271)|
| 4:14:32| That's the same state law that I was talking about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15272)|
| 4:14:34| That state law that passed this spring for audit committees and internal auditors was a very good state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15274)|
| 4:14:40| because what it does is it enables the audit work papers to be confidential, and it enables, it vests responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15280)|
| 4:14:51| I think, appropriate responsibility in audit committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15291)|
| 4:14:58| And when somebody asks a question about financial statements, the definition, is that something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15298)|
| 4:15:03| if a financial statement is in question, I mean, it would have to be brought to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15303)|
| 4:15:06| Would the audit committee vote for that and then it be referred to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15306)|
| 4:15:12| or would that just be something that you guys, again, could initiate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15312)|
| 4:15:16| I doubt if anything dealing with the financial statements was brought to our attention that you'd even want to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15316)|
| 4:15:23| The kind of stuff that gets, you know, that has an emotional appeal when we're talking about audits is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15323)|
| 4:15:31| candidly, the kind of audits that the internal audit group has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15331)|
| 4:15:35| The kind of audits that KPMG does, I'd have you all asleep in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15335)|
| 4:15:41| This stuff is highly, highly technical, highly esoteric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15341)|
| 4:15:46| And it's basically all the financial statements prepared in accordance with financial accounting standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15346)|
| 4:15:52| And, you know, if there was an issue with that, KPMG would be involved, and we would work very closely with KPMG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15352)|
| 4:16:01| They're not going to want to pursue anything unless there's very credible evidence to that effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15361)|
| 4:16:08| Commissioner Anders, because essentially what it would be saying is the financial statements had been issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15368)|
| 4:16:14| with a material misstatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15374)|
| 4:16:16| If someone's bringing it to your attention now, which means what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15376)|
| 4:16:19| KPMG missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15379)|
| 4:16:21| KPMG's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15381)|
| 4:16:22| That's never something they're going to want to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15382)|
| 4:16:24| So if the issue came to our attention, we would involve KPMG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15384)|
| 4:16:28| If there was a need for KPMG to do additional work, like a re-audit, then, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15388)|
| 4:16:33| commission would have to authorize that because it would involve the expenditure of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15393)|
| 4:16:38| I think that the people that I've spoken to and some elected officials are just concerned that there's an ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15398)|
| 4:16:44| with the charter for a witch hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15404)|
| 4:16:46| And I don't want a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15406)|
| 4:16:47| I want something with teeth, and I want you guys to have the ability to do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15407)|
| 4:16:52| But I don't want it to have a loophole that can be used as a witch hunt, kind of like what the ethics committee has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15412)|
| 4:16:58| had the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15418)|
| 4:17:00| And that's what I want to try to prevent now instead of down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15420)|
| 4:17:04| I mean, certainly as it relates to anything that would come in to us anonymously, as I was showing you offline before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15424)|
| 4:17:10| I, you know, got the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15430)|
| 4:17:12| And it said the detailed information received pursuant to such a report of illegal, improper, wasteful, or fraudulent activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15432)|
| 4:17:18| or in any investigation thereof, except those matters disclosed in final public reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15438)|
| 4:17:23| shall be considered audit work papers and shall be confidential under the provisions of Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15443)|
| 4:17:30| So I think you're most at risk with somebody firing anonymous allegations, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15450)|
| 4:17:35| because they can hide behind the cover of anonymity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15455)|
| 4:17:38| And to the extent that happens, first of all, we're not going to investigate it unless there's credibility behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15458)|
| 4:17:44| But even if we did investigate it, it's anonymous until there's some sort of resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15464)|
| 4:17:50| I would like, and I don't know if this is the time and place, but I'd like for us not to take anonymous complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15470)|
| 4:17:56| If somebody wants to put a complaint out there, there's whistleblower protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15476)|
| 4:18:01| There's other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15481)|
| 4:18:02| And I would like for the commission to consider not taking anonymous complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15482)|
| 4:18:05| because if you don't have the credibility in your complaint to put your name on it, you shouldn't put it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15485)|
| 4:18:14| Commissioner Anders, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15494)|
| 4:18:16| The problem is, and maybe Mr. Jarrett can opine, is at least my read of the state law that was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15496)|
| 4:18:21| and that the governor signs requires us to set up a provision that allows anonymous complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15501)|
| 4:18:29| And I think somewhere this came from ties back to the public sector, the private corporate sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15509)|
| 4:18:35| The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2001, which was an outgrowth of Enron and WorldCom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15515)|
| 4:18:41| and other frauds that happened earlier this decade, now requires audit committees of public companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15521)|
| 4:18:47| So every public company in the United States has to have procedures to receive these types of complaints anonymously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15527)|
| 4:18:54| So I don't disagree with you in theory at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15534)|
| 4:18:57| I think the issue is if we're required by state law to do it, then we're in an awkward position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15537)|
| 4:19:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15543)|
| 4:19:04| Thank you, Dr. Cresswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15544)|
| 4:19:05| Mr. Chairman, let me hear that question one more time about if it would be okay with everyone to talk about anonymous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15545)|
| 4:19:15| complaints for just a second, if you'll yield me 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15555)|
| 4:19:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15559)|
| 4:19:20| The thing about anonymous complaints, as it relates to the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15560)|
| 4:19:25| is a little bit different than the anonymous complaints, I think, as it relates to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15565)|
| 4:19:32| Another, and I'll ask the law director to make sure that I state this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15572)|
| 4:19:40| there's a procedure for us receiving anonymous complaints, but it's almost like we have to be anonymous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15580)|
| 4:19:50| in how we handle them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15590)|
| 4:19:51| In other words, we have to meet and see, what's a good word here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15591)|
| 4:20:00| establish some credibility or veracity in the complaint itself on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15600)|
| 4:20:08| Mr. Law Director, would I be getting close to something there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15608)|
| 4:20:12| In other words, we are authorized to have executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15612)|
| 4:20:18| In accordance with the new statute, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15618)|
| 4:20:21| So if we receive an anonymous complaint, it may take us a moment or two to get by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15621)|
| 4:20:30| but it's because of the regulation that we, as public officials, have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15630)|
| 4:20:37| And if we do not find it credible, it never gets anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15637)|
| 4:20:41| It doesn't even get out of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15641)|
| 4:20:43| We are receiving it, verifying it, or looking at it, and making a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15643)|
| 4:20:54| And I think that's an intent of the legislation that we're living under, is that has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15654)|
| 4:21:03| Now, we may not like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15663)|
| 4:21:06| I, in particular, do not, because we have had this come up twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15666)|
| 4:21:11| And both times, my statement has been that's activity that should take place in the big room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15671)|
| 4:21:20| I'm talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15680)|
| 4:21:23| Both of those issues, if they were going to be discussed, would be discussed by full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15683)|
| 4:21:29| And I am saying that for a second time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15689)|
| 4:21:34| You have to remember that the audit committee is nothing more than a working subgroup of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15694)|
| 4:21:41| It can't do anything on itself, by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15701)|
| 4:21:44| It can't do anything on its own, my opinion, my interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15704)|
| 4:21:49| And how long do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15709)|
| 4:21:51| Some people have said two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15711)|
| 4:21:53| I've asked this question, but it's been more than eight or nine or ten months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15713)|
| 4:21:58| Actually, which commissioner has which seat, and how much longer do I have to endure this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15718)|
| 4:22:05| But that's something that faces commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15725)|
| 4:22:08| We have sitting commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15728)|
| 4:22:10| It should only be sitting commissioners that fill those three seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15730)|
| 4:22:14| And we are working in commission's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15734)|
| 4:22:20| Well, the challenge is these new statutory enactments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part1?start=15740)|
