| 0:06:41| Are there other issues that need to be placed on today's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=401)|
| 0:06:51| If not, do I hear a motion that today's agenda is set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| Motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=414)|

| 0:07:33| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Madam Clerk, we had a grouping of 13, 14, and 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| Madam Secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Okay, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| approving a sub-agreement to the Garrett A. Morgan Technology and Transportation Education Program Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| with Carolina A&T University for the provision of assistance to improve preparation of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| particularly women and minorities, in science, technology, engineering, mathematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| through development and other activities related to transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| Commissioner Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| What schools does this resolution apply to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| That was the question that I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Because the STEM academies at the L&N Academy, whether it's at Alson East High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| or which particular schools does this actually assist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| Dr. Alvarez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| Thank you, Chairman Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Commissioners, this is actually a grant with the Knox County Schools with the Federal Highway Transportation Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| So this is a STEM grant that benefits not just students in Knox County, but students across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| So part of our grant responsibilities, part of what NCA&T is supporting us in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| is the development of instructional resources for teachers to utilize to help inform students about different careers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=542)|
| 0:09:10| and opportunities that are available in the transportation field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| So it's a federal grant, it's a national grant that we are taking point on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| and NCA&T is part of that partnership with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=559)|
| 0:09:28| Any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| A move to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=584)|

| 0:10:42| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Do we know how many students participate in these programs, and is it only specific to elementary or middle and high school as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=644)|
| 0:10:55| Dr. Alvarez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| I'm not sure the exact number of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| Schools have the opportunities to apply for these subsidies each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| It tends to be, as you can see, the elementary schools that participate, but we can certainly get you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| If not, I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Seeing no further discussion, motion properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| Resolution 211 is approving a Memorandum of Understanding with Great Schools Partnership for a grant in the amount up to $40,000 for Central High School Schools Acceleration and Recovery Online Program for the 2016-2017 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=691)|
| 0:11:47| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| My question was, how many students are participating in the school's accelerated and recovery program, and does it penalize the school if they graduate early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=711)|
| 0:12:11| Dr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Commissioner, I don't have the exact number of students that are participating at Central High School, but it is probably a couple hundred kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=733)|
| 0:12:24| We can get you the exact number, and they are not penalized for early graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| This is the second installment of a two-year grant from the Great Schools Partnership to help Central High School create a blended academy that combines both live instruction by Central High School teachers and online instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=750)|
| 0:12:46| I would add to that, as I heard the discussion, Board of Education, this is Central High School, and years past, it was only for athletic students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=766)|
| 0:12:59| Currently, it is for all the enrollment at Central, and it is really two separate programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=779)|
| 0:13:07| One is to help accelerate, and the other side of it is to help recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| So this is a twofer program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| Twofer. It's a twofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| And it applies to all students, not just now those that are in athletics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Seeing no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Motion is properly before us and seconded to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=810)|

| 0:14:32| Madam Clerk, is the next item 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| Item number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Resolution 404 is approving Amendment No. 1 in the amount of $19,670 to an agreement with Grisham Smith and Partners for Construction, Engineering, and Inspection Services for the Ebenezer Road and Gleason Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=878)|
| 0:14:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| This question, Dwight or Jim, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| Will this conclude the expenditures for the construction on Ebenezer Road and Gleason Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| Mr. VanVate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| I'm going to defer to Jim on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| I've learned never say never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| We'd like to think so, but this is a change order that was unanticipated, but utilities are a complicated thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| and KUV did have some delay due to weather, and as you know, ATT had some delay as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=923)|
| 0:15:33| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Could you repeat the question, Mr. Schoonmaker, just to make sure I understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| Will this conclude the expenditures for this project at Gleason Drive and Ebenezer Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| In regard to the construction inspection, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| We don't anticipate a change order in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| So this really is just for the engineering inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| The construction contract should come in under budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| And then the final 100% turnover is on October what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| The contractor, Charles Blalock & Sons, has until October 28th, Friday, October 28th, to get the project open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=962)|
| 0:16:12| He has until November, I think, the 17th, to get everything 100% complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| If he's not done by the 28th, we'll be assessing $750 a day for every day beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| And then to Mr. Vandervate's comment about AT&T, while I was in Nashville last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| I did have a conversation with the powers-to-be with AT&T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| and so I'll fill you in at a later time period of how that turned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=998)|

| 0:17:36| Pretty much, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| That would be Commissioner Fensler's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1058)|

| 0:30:37| That's what I was just going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1837)|

| 0:30:40| That's the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| And you called it the right thing, a flu shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| It's technically an inoculation, but our son said it doesn't matter what you call it, it's still a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1845)|
| 0:30:53| We can still receive our flu shot at 4 o'clock and then meander in for one-on-ones and group meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1853)|
| 0:31:02| and tour of the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1862)|

| 0:31:12| Is this one of the last things we do, announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| I've still got four more dates that we've got to establish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| I do need to ask a question of Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| The thing that is being added about this award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| does that also cover the report from the Tennessee County Commissioners Association meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| Is that what that's about also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| I think Ms. Carringer is working very diligently on that with the help of Mr. Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| so I guess that's probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| That needs to be a part of this one item that you said we needed to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| Well, that or at the end of the meeting maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| Okay, so we're going to actually have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| Please add a discussion item at the end of next week's agenda for a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| and feedback from the Tennessee County Commissioners Association meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1925)|

| 0:33:15| Normally I think it's like a box lunch, but it doesn't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| If this fits with their schedule, will it fit with our schedule to do November the 14th at noon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| I see a majority of the heads shaking yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=2008)|

| 0:33:57| I expect you to walk in and walk out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| And then some might say this is sort of stretching the schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161017?start=2045)|
