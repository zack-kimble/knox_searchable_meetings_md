| 0:01:07| Just a couple of announcements from the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| When I call the name of your business that's applying for the permit, please come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| podium and state very clearly your name and address so that we can make that part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| If you're an applicant and all of your paperwork is done and your file is complete tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| at the end of the beer board meeting, you can go see Ms. Day or Ms. Dyer over here at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| the end of the podium, and they will be happy to give you your signed permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| If you don't have all your documentation in or there's something that you need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| then once all of that is done, you'll have to go to the business tax office to pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| And an example of that would be we might approve pending final documentation because you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| have your inspections completed or something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| For the beer board members, we're still in the save a tree mode, and so when we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| something or postpone it, if you'll just pass all these to the right, we'll take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=124)|

| 0:02:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| The first case is 5 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Sergeant Hunter, is the record check complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=128)|

| 0:02:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=135)|

| 0:02:20| approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=140)|

| 0:02:55| It's going to be a restaurant and bar, a little bit more upscale than what was there previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| So, designers are out of New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| It's to complement the hotel, to be honest, to give an experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=177)|

| 0:03:26| Things to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Again, because we do this every month until you finally pick up your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| So, when you hear from us, you'll still need to come back and tell us where you are and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| if you're going to open sooner or if you're going to open later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=217)|

| 0:03:52| or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=232)|

| 0:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=869)|

| 0:14:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Do you want to tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| I don't want somebody to think I can come to the fair and just walk through drinking beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| and get on the Ferris wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| So do you want to tell us about this particular license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| The beer will just be served to support our concerts at the Homer Hamilton Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| That is a contained area with only two entries and exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| When patrons come in to purchase a beer, they will have to be ID'd, get a wristband to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| able to purchase beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| They only can buy two at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| We'll have KPD officers right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| We have a trained vendor ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| And then once they get over as far as the concert being ended, they've either got to dump it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| or they've got to drink it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| You're not going to be walking up and down the midway drinking a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| Sounds like a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Is there any other area where they walk out with the band on where they can go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Contained in that one facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| It's a theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=923)|

| 0:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Good luck with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=929)|

| 0:15:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| I checked it off here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=937)|

| 0:15:39| And they've got a series of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=939)|

| 0:18:12| We received a health department yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| So would you like us to extend this for 30 days in case something goes awry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| He can just go in and present his documents to Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| When you get the documents in hand, just take them in to Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| If something happens that you don't get the documents, then you'll come back in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| You think you'll be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| How soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| Friday, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| As soon as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| We'll be open soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Do you get all the things worked out for the gas, the burner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| We're still working with codes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| So we will be opening as a bar and not as a brewery right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| So we still have a few options to go through with them, and I hope that we get that done soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| We have a question from the Crafty Bastard on Emory Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| The Crafty Bastard on Emory Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| Where is the bastard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| Councilman Della Vopa, you have waited now for a year to ask that question, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Councilman Greer, this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| No, it's not in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| My next door neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| I am the next door neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| I am the next door neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| This is the Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| They are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| No, I just said they, in fact, when I left at 5 o'clock, they were still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| So I don't know what the final situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Well, Madam Chair, I'll make a motion we move this to the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| This is September 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Is this the one with the contamination that had to be removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| I had the distance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| They're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| We have a motion and a second to extend this to September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| The next is the Preservation Pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| And this is pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| They need to accommodate another event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| So they want to go from September 17th through October 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| So do you want to give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Bernadette West, 28 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| She wants to have a month long or half month long thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Or are we moving the date from one day to a different day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| One date to the next date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| I'll take a month long thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| I like that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| This is going to be a great party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Another event was scheduled on September 17th with Friends of the Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| And so they have agreed to move to October 2nd, if we will bless that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| So do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| It's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Now, we have some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| We have a question that has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| And before you, Mr. Frost handed out a paper that is the State of Tennessee Verification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1269)|
| 0:21:17| of Entitlements Act, the City of Knoxville application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| And effective July the 1st, all individuals who have at least a 5% membership, ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1283)|
| 0:21:32| rather, must have been lawful citizens of the U.S. for not less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| And this requirement only applies to an individual who holds at least 5% or more in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| So this is the application that they will be filling out beginning tomorrow so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| we are in compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Is it the change on the second page by 14, is that what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| Well, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| It's the change on the beer permit application, but this first page is actually what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| will be filling out when they apply for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| And this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| The legal permanent resident is the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Is the category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| And eligibility verification of entitlement to hold a beer permit is what the official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| document is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| So everyone has to fill this out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| Everyone has to fill this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| And it's pretty much the same as when you're hiring somebody for your business and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| have to prove their citizenship and provide documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| And so the acceptable items of documentation are listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| We have talked about this now for about a month, and the actual documents that are presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1359)|
| 0:22:47| will not come to the beer board, but they will make a photocopy and put them in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| file of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| Because some of that has some confidential information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| But we will have on the permit that we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| The application that we receive, the place for them to sign that they have met that citizenship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| And if they can't prove that, they won't be coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| What happens if we make a mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Is there any type of liability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Well, if they misrepresent something and it's granted based on their misrepresentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| I think it's voidable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| But...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| What's voidable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| The permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| I mean, you can't give a permit based on the false information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| What if we didn't do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| What would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| We would just be violating state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Out of compliance with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Councilman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| How do you verify ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Well, when the people come in right now, I mean, even last month, they fill out the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| listing who's the owner and the percentage of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| If you look, for example, at that Broadway location, somebody put down that they owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| It ends up they didn't necessarily own 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150818?start=1451)|
