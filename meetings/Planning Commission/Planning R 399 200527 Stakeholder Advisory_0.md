| 0:05:03| Jennifer Roach represented Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| She has resigned her position with that car and accepted a position with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| Therefore, it's no longer on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| I appreciate all the work Jennifer did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| She was a great ally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=320)|

| 0:06:18| As you know, Stephanie Welch was the city council representative on the committee with her election or her resignation from city council and her acceptance of position with the city administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=378)|
| 0:06:31| She's now staff and supports from a staff angle, but no longer council representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| So we hope to have a council representative at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| Just as a side note, this is my last meeting with the committee and I have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of you through the updated zoning code and other activities and I will miss all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=400)|
| 0:06:54| Won't miss the zoning ordinance so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| I will miss all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Hope to stay in touch and see you when I visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| I'll be moving to North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=423)|

| 0:07:17| Hope to see you all continue your dedication to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=437)|

| 0:07:34| Yes, Gerald, I would agree. I think you really conducted this process with a very even hand, with a lot of civility to many, many voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=454)|
| 0:07:50| And I can say that even though we don't always agree, but I think it would be hard to imagine this process of being led by anyone else and being able to go to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=470)|

| 0:08:48| And if you have a question, just for those of you who don't remember Zoom, if you click on or run your cursor over the bottom of the screen showing all the folks, you'll see a little icon in the word participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=528)|
| 0:09:07| If you click on that, all the participants will show up on the right side of your screen and there's a little menu tab at the bottom that says raise hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=547)|
| 0:09:16| So if you want to speak, just push that and I'll try to stay aware of who raises their hand and wants to speak and try to call you on you in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| The first item for consideration, the only one really for today for discussion is direction from city council during the development of the new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=564)|
| 0:09:37| We tried to accommodate all the development, residential development patterns with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=577)|
| 0:09:47| To be honest, as few zoning districts as possible to make administration and understanding of the code a bit easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=587)|
| 0:09:56| There were two, three single family districts created the established neighborhood, which is a distinct zoning district, the RN1 with a lot area of 10,000 square feet and RN2 with a lot area of 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=596)|
| 0:10:11| There was concern because of the gap between the RN1 and RN2 of that 5,000 square feet difference that there are a number of lots in the RN2 that exceed 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=611)|
| 0:10:27| And that is because there were some traditional lots, older lots in neighborhoods that had a standard lot size of 50 feet wide by 150 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=627)|
| 0:10:38| Some of the newer lots developed under the old zoning code which has fairly pretty standardized 7,500 square foot minimum lot area for the single family zoning districts of 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=638)|
| 0:10:52| There was a concern expressed that developers would purchase two lots in a neighborhood adjoining lots that may be 7,500 square feet, have a total of 1,500 square feet, divide those two lots into three lots, demolish the homes, and create three new building lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=652)|
| 0:11:15| Now, that's not as easy as it sounds because the RN2 district has a minimum lot width of 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=675)|
| 0:11:24| So the lots would have to be two lots purchased that had 7,500 square feet would each have to be 75 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=684)|
| 0:11:33| Most of the lots developed with the 7,500 square foot lot area have 50 foot lot widths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| It would be challenging to create three lots out of two standard 7,500 square foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=700)|
| 0:11:48| There was a concern about that so city council during the final review of the new zoning code identified this consideration that is a need for the new single family zoning district as a task for the planning commission or the stakeholder committee to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=708)|
| 0:12:11| And during our analysis, we did find that 57% of the 2,400, 883 property zoned RN2 have a lot area of 7,500 square feet or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=731)|
| 0:12:25| So more than half the lots do have that 7,500 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| We have not done an analysis to see if those lots are typically 75 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| Based on just informal knowledge, that is my knowledge of looking at the KGIS maps of the city looking at standard lot sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=754)|
| 0:12:47| most lots that are 7,500 square feet have a lot width of 50 feet and a depth of 150 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| which would make it impossible to buy two adjoining lots and create three new lots in the RN2 area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| So having said that, I'm going to show the screen and try to share my screen and show where some clusters of lots that are RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=781)|
| 0:13:16| Oh, while the host disabled participants screen sharing, so I can't share my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| Never mind. The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| But we did find some clusters of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| Oh, I can do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| Hopefully you can see my screen. Can you see my screen with the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| And there is a cluster in this area, which is the biggest area that has lots, RN2 lots, greater than 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=832)|
| 0:14:06| There's small clusters here in the town city area over off of near Central Avenue Pike off Jim Sturkey Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=846)|
| 0:14:23| and some in the more northwest section of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| Again, we don't know if those are yet. We have not done the analysis yet to determine whether those have lot widths of 75 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=870)|
| 0:14:39| or if it could be possible to buy two adjoining lots and subdivide them into three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| At this point, staff feels that this question merits further study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| but we need to do more analysis before we can determine if any steps should be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=891)|
| 0:15:00| And that's the recommendation we have for the committee to just allow continued study of this effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=900)|
| 0:15:11| to enable staff to further study the configuration of those lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| to look at development over the next six months or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| to determine if there is a pattern of developers purchasing two lots in an RN2 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=922)|
| 0:15:31| demolishing the existing homes and creating three lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| and resulting in a density that would have adverse impacts on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| And with that, I'll be happy to answer any questions or listen to comments and discussion by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| So, Joe, I mean, is the question to postpone the decision right now until further information is gathered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=946)|
| 0:15:55| That's that's correct. Just enable staff or direct staff to continue to study this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| to do further analysis of those RN2 lots which have a lot area more than 7,500 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=960)|
| 0:16:08| and to monitor development patterns in those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| Yes, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| It seems like we've got a couple of different issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| One is the question of whether an RN2 5,000 square foot minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=979)|
| 0:16:29| So whether the problem that you're talking about where a developer might take two adjoining lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| and put them together and make three properties out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| That's one thing. But the other thing is just in general, in rezoning to RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| it seems to me, and I've just gone through an experience like this, that there should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| in any case, there should be a zone that is for 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| I assume that you're going to proceed with that even apart from the question of the lot combinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| I think you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| And I see, you know, we have a long list of paths that we have to catch up on from sector plans that are out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1031)|
| 0:17:24| The mayor has directed us to look at the east side of the community, basically, of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| basically from Hill Avenue going in an arc over towards all the way to the old St. Mary's to Noble Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| looking at all the development opportunities and projects over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| We've been directed by county commission to look at a corridor plan for Western Avenue, Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| for Alcoa Highway, and the city council has, as I also asked for those studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| to create a new zoning district for no purpose is not a priority that the staff needs or the city needs to undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1074)|
| 0:18:04| I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| We have a zoning district that accommodates 7,500 square foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| That is the RN2 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| Fear is not a direction this city needs to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| I would like to give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| On my street, there was a lot that was proposed for rezoning, and the rezoning would have been from R1 to R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1105)|
| 0:18:35| That would cut in half the required minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| The lot was just under an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| It could have led to seven, possibly eight lots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1124)|
| 0:18:52| If it was 7,500 square feet, it would have been a more reasonable transition from an R1 to another district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1132)|
| 0:19:02| It was ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| We were able to keep it as R1 and not let it be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| but it does not make sense to have the only option next to an R1 be a 5,000 square foot proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1149)|
| 0:19:24| That would have required a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| The rezoning did not occur, and there are a number of other things that kept up the fear of eight lots from occurring on that one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1166)|
| 0:19:34| There was a need for streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| The most I believe he could get on that acre was five lots, even with RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| Again, I don't think we need to create a new zoning district, go to the work that's required for that to address a fear over one acre being divided into more lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1183)|
| 0:19:55| It's simply an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| This committee certainly can direct that, and we can place it on that work plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| But to address, to operate out of fear is not something that this city will not advance through its potential if we continue to base every decision we have on fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1204)|
| 0:20:17| Don't label it as fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| It makes good sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| It was just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| It makes good sense to think about a stepwise progression from R1 down with 10,000 square feet minimum down to R2 rather than going to half the size of the lots that are required in R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1223)|
| 0:20:41| Okay, now I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| Any other comments, thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Gerald, this is Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Yes, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| I think, you know, I'll go ahead and make a motion that I think that the planning staff should pursue the creation of a new single family residential district with a minimum lot size of 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1254)|
| 0:21:06| In other words, what staff has recommended in terms of looking into, I'll go ahead and make a motion that that should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| And just to clarify that motion, would that be to accept staff's recommendation to continue the analysis and do background research and report back to the committee in the spring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1272)|
| 0:21:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Can they do it quicker than one year? Can they do it in six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| Not given the backlog of work that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| I can make a promise knowing that I don't have to live up to it and say we could do it more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1300)|
| 0:21:49| I think the staff would certainly try, but given the projects that are on the work program and the backlog of activities we have, I think spring is realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1309)|
| 0:21:58| And also that would give time to address the question of the analysis of development activity and the pattern of redevelopment in those RN2 neighborhoods to see if lots are being purchased, homes demolished, and the lots recombined to increase the density in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1318)|
| 0:22:18| Well, I would just hate to see that begin to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| And so, you know, again, my motion would be to have it done as quickly as possible in the schedule that you folks have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| But I'd hate for us to sit around and wait a year and watch that happen when it really shouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1348)|

| 0:22:36| Okay. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1357)|

| 0:24:16| There any other items from any of the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| I apologize for getting passionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| I apologize too, although I disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| As you know, I think, I think if there's a need we address it but don't do it just because of fear if we see it, there's a need and it provides a good direction for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1468)|
| 0:24:39| I think that's why we need the time and staff to do the more analysis of this to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1479)|

| 0:24:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1497)|
| 0:25:11| I think that's why we need the time and staff to do the more analysis of this to see what direction we're going with the existing are into standard, and what the what the positive aspects of that are, and the negative aspects rather than just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| than just saying, it's going to be bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| But I appreciate you giving us the time to do the analysis and bring more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| If I could make one comment here, I think we have the basic difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| Let's put aside the question of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| The basic difference is that apart from what comes up, the analysis of what has occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1536)|
| 0:25:45| so far, there is a question of whether it's a good thing to have an intermediate stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| district that is neither the 5,000 minimum, that not only R2, but I believe it's R3 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1552)|
| 0:26:01| R4, all 5,000, to have an intermediate between that standard and the 10,000 standard minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1561)|
| 0:26:14| To me, it doesn't make sense not to have something that is in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| And we'll take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| So we'll consider that as we look at this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Another solution is applying more R and 3 to the map and filling the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1591)|
| 0:26:40| That's one of the tasks that the staff is looking at, trying to identify where R and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| 3 would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| We did have some challenges when we tried to map R and 3 in one of the draft zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| maps that some of the neighborhoods were concerned about allowing small-scale multifamily in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| That's another both opportunity and challenge for the staff and for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1622)|
| 0:27:10| Any other comments, items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1630)|

| 0:27:26| There was a lot of conversation about the validity of that within the immediate downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| area with the two areas that are kind of on Jackson and, of course, over on Hill Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1653)|
| 0:27:41| Where did that end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Did that go to the design review board level and it's determined there, or is it still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| It's planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| If any development wants to, in fact, that amendment was adopted or trying to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1673)|
| 0:28:05| if it's gone through second reading that if any waivers or exceptions, the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| plan goes to the planning commission and they review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| Just for downtown or any district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Any district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| We've decided that it would be appropriate for any district rather than limiting it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200527-stakeholder-advisory?start=1697)|
