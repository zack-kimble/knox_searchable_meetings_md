| 0:01:14| And I also need to withdraw item number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| I've met with Cindy and Dwight in the law department and we have, we think, a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| way of approaching that problem that's going to include a work session for the incoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=82)|

| 0:01:40| Hi, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| I had a couple of clarifications on items 20 and 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=101)|
| 0:01:47| On number 20, the CEI services for the Connor Road Bridge, that'll be with AMIC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| It will be the selected contractor and it'll be for $137,173.80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=114)|
| 0:02:02| And on item 21, you may want to pass that without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| We're still waiting on concurrence from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| We've sent all our paperwork into TDOT, but they are still, haven't given us official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| concurrence yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| So, we may, I'll let you know one way or the other Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=137)|

| 0:06:39| Well, we're going to pull that, though, aren't we, Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| I want Doug to make a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Go ahead, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| I'll try to make a long story short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=404)|
| 0:06:54| We've been working on this project for several years now, and the last year especially, trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| to complete two critical easements or land acquisitions to complete this Greenway link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| During the process, one of the pieces of property from TTC Halls has a wetland mitigation project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| on it as a part of retail development up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| We are moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| I think we're going to get everything done this month, and we're in a very tight timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| with about one month left on a grant project here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| But just last month, we found out there was a violation notice filed against this wetland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| mitigation project, which really kicks us into a whole other situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| We're projecting the cost to correct the wetland projects would be somewhere between $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| and $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| So, in other words, we would inherit all the problems with this wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| We'd also be responsible for the monitoring and inspections for the next somewhere between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| five and ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| So we would really be taking on another problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| So we don't feel good going forward with the unknown expenses at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| What we're hoping to do is let this work itself out, let the developer work with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| to complete the wetland mitigation problems there, and once they are complete, come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| and work with them to get the land transferred and build the Greenway then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| We're also confident we can probably build the Greenway in-house using just the matching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| funds that we had on the state project here, build it in-house and get it done a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| faster and a little more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| So that's our hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Clayton Park is still moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| It's under construction right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| We're also working with Engineering and Public Works for a future connection from Clayton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| Park down to the existing Greenway, which would not be a part of this grant project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| So at this point, there's just a lot of unknowns on this particular section, and we just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| feel it would be in the taxpayer's best interest to take on this kind of problem with the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| of unknowns we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| And, Doug, I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| You know, Commissioner, this is what he's saying is we're fixing to inherit some property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| that's going to have some money costs to it, so we're going to hold off, let them fix it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| on their end, and then we'll transfer the property at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| So, Commissioner Smith's motion is to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| We have a motion to withdraw and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=543)|

| 0:09:06| Page 11, Item 40, Resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=546)|

| 0:09:21| in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $4,200,000, making provision for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| issuance, sale, and payment of said notes, establishing the terms thereof, and the disposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| of proceeds therefrom, and providing for the levy of taxes for the payment of principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| thereof and interest thereon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| We've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Commissioner Browns, do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| We've got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Commissioner Browns and Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Chris, do you want to come down and explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Was there any questions for Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| I know Commissioner Schultz might have a question about the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Did you record your previous speech, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Just play it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Really easy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| When you all approved the five-year capital plan, it was a little over $4 million for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=603)|
| 0:10:13| a short-term note of three years for some equipment that ranges from Ferris vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=613)|
| 0:10:29| to some things in engineering and public works, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| And so all this resolution is doing is approving the funding mechanism for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=632)|
| 0:10:40| And Mark Mametoff wrote this resolution up not to exceed 4.2 because you always do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=640)|
| 0:10:47| in even amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| And approval of this just gives us the ability to go ahead and move forward with this capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| It's a three-year note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| What's the interest rate on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| We won't know that until we get to the next point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| I'm assuming it's going to be very similar to what we saw today in finance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| around three would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| The life of the stuff that we're buying all exceeds the life of the note, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| It's always been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Not necessarily with Knox County, but with other public entities around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| We looked at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| I'm sure that Mark did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| So Mark Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| And so, yeah, we are well within the life of the items that we're buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=687)|
| 0:11:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Page 12, item 44, resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| It's authorizing the execution of a waiver of certain restrictions applicable to property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| in the Forks of the River Industrial Park owned by Fresenius USA Manufacturing, Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| Commissioner Rotts, move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| I'll second so we can ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Commissioner Brown, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| What are the waiver of what restrictions are we talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| You don't need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Yeah, I'm Chris Trump, 8703 Villacrest Circle in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| I'm here on behalf of Todd Napier of the Velma Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| I represent the Industrial Development Board as their counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| We have a relationship with Fresenius for some economic incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| The item being waived in particular is just one item that's merely being waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| There's a map at the back of the waiver if you happen to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| It's really small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| It's hard to tell, but basically there's a 50-foot setback requirement for the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| and they have one little small corner in the very bottom right-hand corner of the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| that is 24.5 feet away from the road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| And so it's just granting them that waiver for a 50-foot setback requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| Instead, it's 24.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| No, we don't have that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| That's why I wanted to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| It should be attached to the very back of that packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| I think it's attached to the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| but it's actually the Panasonic folks built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| and so Fresenius wants to invest in that part of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| and so this kind of allows them to make that investment with the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Is that in claimant's terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| They've acquired the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| and is there any preexisting condition that we're just trying to clean it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| so they won't be in violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| We have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=823)|

| 0:15:53| Remarkably, it was approved 19 to nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| which is really staggering when I think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| but it was approved 19 to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| I think probably from just agriculture to neighborhood commercial, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| I didn't research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| Nevertheless, it was approved for primarily a Weigel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| and some other things planned out there, a bank and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| But the neighborhood was expressly requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| and I remember some talks back then four years ago, a fire station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| which would logically be rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| And please, I want Commissioner Briggs to comment on this too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| because it's certainly his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Commissioner Briggs and I had a meeting about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| at the Farragut City Hall in a properly sunshine meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| that was attended by rural metro and some neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| and just interested parties about trying to move this off, move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| Obviously, I'm going to be sitting here for less than six weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| so I wanted to get it on the agenda and just get some attention focused on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| and I've made a few phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| I think there's some interested neighbors here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| and rural metro is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| I did talk to Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| He was on vacation, and if you got your email from John Huber, the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| he sent us some good data, but he's out of town on an emergency, it said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| But apparently, because of the lack of a fire hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| just to simplify this and condense it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| the ISO, that's the rating given to our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| and everyone's homes by some impartial rating agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| that the insurance underwriters hire, I think it's going to go to a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| Jerry can address this, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| By comparison, in Knoxville, I think most homes are a 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| 3 and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| 3 and 8, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| But as a consequence, by going to a 10, just to give you a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| show the impact, financial impact of what this is going to do to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| looking at these numbers that Mr. Hubert supplied us, provided us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| a $300,000 home is the average in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| and in a three-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| the increase is going to equate roughly to $2.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| So $3 million, if you extrapolate that out to a five-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| it will exceed $10 million in increased insurance premiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| because of the lack of a fire station, to be quite blunt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| As you may recall, rural metro took a Chapter 11 bankruptcy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| primarily because of a leveraged buyout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| which has nothing to do with a local operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| It's a multinational company, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| That sort of gave the banks cold feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| but I was told by Mr. Hubert that last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Home Federal did tentatively approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| the loan committee approved the loan for his building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| but it's still sort of in the catch-22 area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| because I don't think the lease payment makes the debt service payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| so he's going to request a pilot through the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| It's a long story, but nevertheless, I wanted to focus some attention on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Am I leaving anything out, Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| I mean, you've been involved probably more than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Yeah, no, not really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| and I appreciate all the work that Ed has done on this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| Really what it is is that John Hubert is willing to put the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| on the back part of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| and they need a connecting driveway up to Choteau Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| It's a little complicated all that what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| but Home Federal initially did not approve the loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| even though Rural Metro was willing to take a pretty long-term lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| I can't remember what it was, maybe 10 years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| but they wanted a commitment that if Rural Metro did pull out for any reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| that the county would give some sort of guarantee that whoever did provide the fire service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| would pick up the lease because this is really just a single-use building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| Of course, the county can't do this because we're really watching this from the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| These are two private entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| This is not like ambulance services where the county does have some sort of vested interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| but all we could do was to facilitate the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| and then see if we can assist with some of the cost of building the road with this pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| and I think really now the pilot is the key,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| and that will have to be approved by the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| Ultimately, I guess it would come to us for approval also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| but this really is important to the residents out there of the entire county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| and I think Jerry's out there, I think of the entire county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| this is the poorest coverage that we have just about anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| and I think by having a fire station there will address that lack of coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| and it will help the residents with their insurance rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| That was kind of my question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| I mean, this really, as far as the insurance rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| I think that really doesn't have anything to do with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| So we're talking chicken and something else, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1255)|
| 0:21:04| But in terms of a pilot for a road for a single-use facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1264)|
| 0:21:14| I'm struggling with that one, you know, and you all know I struggle with pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1274)|
| 0:21:22| and TIFs in very parts of the county that were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1282)|
| 0:21:33| the sale of property can probably generate significant income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| I mean, if you look at North Shore Town Center where we gave a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| those lots, the small lots are going for a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| I mean, just the out parcels are going for a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| and they needed money to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| I mean, so, again, this conversation is not about poor fire coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| That's not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| That's between those entities, those two private entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| We're talking about a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| and if a developer can't get a road done within what looks like, you know, Mr. Hubers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1325)|
| 0:22:14| I appreciate his projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| They're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| I supported his last one, and he does a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| But he does it at a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| And if he can't get that road completed, you know, I think he can within his profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| Again, I'm not seeing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| So I would say it's going to have to be very encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| It's going to have to be a strong case for us to give a pilot or a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| We don't give pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| It would be a TIF, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| No, this is a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| This would be a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Yeah, but, you know, a payment in lieu of tax for X amount of years, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| where that's our most ñ when we're looking at a tax base that's stagnant, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| we hadn't had any kind of movement in our taxes except for downward rate as we reassess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| So, you know, at some point we have to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| As Commissioner Briggs always say, how do you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| You don't raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| You don't, you know, you grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| This is part of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| This is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| If we're growing in the Choteau area, okay, we're growing our fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| Okay, rural metro's gotten things going, and we're growing, and the roads are part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Is it possible for us to offset the cost of a road by freezing the tax levels at first blush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| Again, I want to see the details, but at first blush I take issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| If I might, I'll just make a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| This is a little bit different, I think, because this is ñ it's not really ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| yes, it is a for-profit because rural metro's for-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| but it also is a public safety issue where we're trying ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| I think when we're providing police, fire, ambulance services, it's a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| because it does involve the loss of life or property if it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| I believe that this ñ I've looked at the numbers with John Huber, but it's been a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| but this is just about a break-even thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| He's trying to get his building paid for, and it's a public service that he's offering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1449)|
| 0:24:18| but he just wants to be sure that the building that's being built can be paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| and that he's not losing money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| I mean, it's ñ like I said, this is a public safety issue as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| Chairman, there's a ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| By the way, Mr. McKenzie, I do appreciate you coming over to my view on growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| I think there's a couple of people who may want to speak to this, Mr. Desmond, possibly, if they still want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| I did notify them of the meeting and have been very involved in this process through the months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| Sir, if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| My name is Kevin Desmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| My address is 2428 Caravelle Lane, Knoxville, 37933.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| That's Channel Point Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| I'm president of the Channel Point Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| This is taking a little bit different direction than I thought it might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| but I think the safety issue is obviously a primary concern for the residents out there of the Choteau area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1517)|
| 0:25:28| I moved out there in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| Since that time, we have probably had the number of rooftops double or triple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1531)|
| 0:25:39| It would be astronomical the amount of growth that we have had out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| Very quickly, I'll just name off a few of the subdivisions that we're talking about trying to get adequate fire coverage for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| Montgomery Cove, the woods at Montgomery Cove, Jefferson Park, Choteau Hills, Greystone Court, Mallard Bay, Walnut Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1549)|
| 0:25:57| Herons Point, Falcon Point, Cabot Ridge, Bayou Bend, Choteau Estates, Hedgestone, Bluff Point, Ribbondale, Lakeshore Meadows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1557)|
| 0:26:06| and my subdivision of Channel Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| That is not all inclusive, but that is some of the more larger, well-established neighborhoods out in the Choteau sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1569)|
| 0:26:18| I don't know exactly what it's going to take to get this complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| but I really hope and pray that we can get there today or very shortly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| because this has really been on the back burner, let's say, for a good long while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| And I'm fearful that we're really going to have an incident happen out there that's going to cause a loss of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| Thanksgiving night, this past Thanksgiving, we had a house fire about 200 yards from the entrance of Channel Point subdivision where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1602)|
| 0:26:52| There was no loss of human life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| They did lose a pet, but the house is totally gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| And we are serviced right now by Blue Grass Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| Blue Grass is 5.1 miles from the intersection of Choteau and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| From that intersection, you could travel another 3.25 miles to get to the end of Choteau Peninsula where there are homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1630)|
| 0:27:19| So from Blue Grass to the end of the peninsula, you have well over eight miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| And Choteau is not like North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| You're not going to do 50 miles an hour on Choteau Road in a fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| You've got blind, windy curves and blind hilltops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| And, you know, maybe a fire truck could do 30 or so, but it's not going to do 50 or 60 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| So when seconds count, we're having far too many seconds right now to answer the call out there, and we really need your assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1661)|
| 0:27:50| The tax base out there in that area of the county has to be astronomical from what it once was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1670)|
| 0:27:58| And we need a little assistance here from the county to get this thing over the goal line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| I don't know what else I can say to make that happen, but there are thousands of people, fellow Knox County-ans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| that are depending on your support and need your help in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| And I appreciate your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| I think if I could speak, I think we have two issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| One is the TIF pilot potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| The other is probably a discussion we need to have about countywide fire protection outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| And so long term, I think that when is this going to go before IBD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Jerry, do we know when it may go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| I think those are the two that hopefully when the new commissioners come on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| we could probably have a discussion about countywide fire protection outside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| and what it would take to get that looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| That might be a good chairman's luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| Well, that would be longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Yeah, it's going to take a group of people getting together that know fire service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| and know purchasing and fire service, finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Everybody will have to be involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| but that's kind of one of the things we'd like to do after the 1st of September to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| I'd like to ask a question of Mr. Harnish, if you wouldn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1756)|
| 0:29:27| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| I need the name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Jerry Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| My address is 1339 Grenoble Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| When you look at that Choteau area, you have homes, but you've also got businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| You've also got the marina down there and just a variety of things that growth has brought to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| Now, he mentioned Bluegrass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| What about Campbell Station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| If you have a major fire, where are the units coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| From Campbell Station, Watt Road, Bluegrass, and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| So what would be the average response time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| Let's say you had a major fire at one of the businesses or the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| What would be the response time just generally to get to, let's say, the farthest reaches of Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| if that were to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Well, to get to the intersection of Choteau and North Shore on a good day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| the engine is going to require six or seven minutes, and that's excellent conditions, no traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1823)|
| 0:30:33| Clearly, to try to move any more quickly than that would require the crews to proceed at an unsafe speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| Mr. Desmond's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Once a unit turns onto Choteau Road, those speeds just aren't possible and control the vehicle safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| So to get to the furthest end of Choteau under best conditions, I'm going to guess 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| So let's take the rest of the county minus Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| What would be the average response time for other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| I'm not talking about like the Seymour Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| You may or may not know that, but I'm just wondering what would be the response time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| The suburbs, the average response time is around five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| The rural areas, the average goes up around seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| but certainly nothing like the amount of time it takes to get to the end of Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| So my point is that we're talking about the money aspect of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| and that's important to people because they pay those rates, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| But the other aspect to it is we have a section of our county that's basically double the response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| And so without this fire station, that's basically what we could be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| Not necessarily we are, but we could be should we have some type of an incident there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| So I'm all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| I won't have a chance to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| but I want to encourage my commissioners to seriously look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| because those folks out there deserve the same kind of response time as the other people in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| I think that's fair, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| Again, I started out by saying let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| We're not, I think our chair has his own point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| Let's separate these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| I'm not talking about fire response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| That's not what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| That should have been done a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| And I think no one disagrees with Childo's Men Groin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| He's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| We sat and talked about the Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| That may have been one of those, turn the commissioners right, and Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| That may have been one of our initial meetings, one of those 2 a.m. meetings we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| We went on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| So we realize that that area is one of tremendous growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| But we're not talking about fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| We're talking about a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| And when we're talking about roads, and three years ago, you know, I turned to Dwight and Jim and Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1973)|
| 0:33:02| There needs to be a road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| They need to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| We need to turn to our experts, and we stop getting sidetracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| There needs to be a comprehensive look at where we are with roads in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| not just I'm a developer, I'm a neighborhood, I'm a person here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| All that feeds into it, but we need to look at roads and how our roads are from a safety and health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| from accessibility, from a width, and look at what our plan is for roads within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| We sat here during budget time talking about how our engineering department is being stifled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| because it's a fairly flat rate that they get, and we're talking about, you know, flattening our rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2025)|
| 0:33:55| So, again, I'm not talking about safety and health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| I'm not talking about fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| I'm talking about roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| I'm not talking about giving an entity, while he may not make money on this particular deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| with this particular fire station, I'm sure his project will be a profitable one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| That, of that, I'm sure, and I support Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| I voted for every one of his projects, so that's not what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| He's going to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| He's going to make money in Choteau, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| So, but we need to turn to the engineering staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| Maybe, like you said, let's look at roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Let's have some budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| I mean, let's have some open meetings on how our roads are because the folks in Corrington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| the folks in deep south Knox County have issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| Folks in, you know, upper north, we have roads issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| We all know that, but let's rack and stack our roads projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| You know, you guys know that first year when we came with this road to nowhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| which is still a road to nowhere with outlets, limited mall, you know, we just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| we come up with these projects and they somehow supersede the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| And I think we end up with projects that aren't well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| And maybe this, I'm sure this one's going to be great, but if we're talking about roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| let's talk about roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| If we're talking about giving TIFs for roads or pilots for roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| let's, again, let's look at that with that lens on and not this, you know, emotional piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| Or we're going to make a bunch of money piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| If we built this road, we're going to make a bunch of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| If we built this road, we're going to save a bunch of lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| Yes, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| But maybe we're, you know, there's other lives that we can save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| Maybe there's other areas that aren't, that are in more dire need than this particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| And that's my only point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Again, let me stop by saying we're not talking about fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| That's not the conversation that we're having here with this pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| We're talking about a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| for saying the focus that we're looking at right at the moment is fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| East of Knoxville Center Mall, and this is in response to Commissioner Hammond's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2180)|
| 0:36:31| between Millertown and Washington Pike on Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| because we're talking about fire protection in a per-pay basis, the response times are just as bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2197)|
| 0:36:47| It's because the fire stations are outlying and have to come back toward the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| So we're really talking about fire protection, or at least I think as the Chair has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| that's the conversation we need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| And the consideration right now that we're having about a for-profit business in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2221)|
| 0:37:11| maybe we're trying to mix too many subjects into one big pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| I just wanted to comment to the fact that there are poorly rated fire protection zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| and they're right on the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| Any other discussion? Anybody else? Commissioner Shouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| In conclusion, my request would just be that the newly reconstituted commission in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| going forward, look at this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| I understand the county is not in the fire department business, and probably will not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| but I guess that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| I'm sure there are other areas that maybe need to be addressed also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| I just wanted to focus some attention on it so it could hopefully move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| I've had a lot of conversations, I think Commissioner Briggs has too, with area residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| to show that we are aware of it, and hopefully we can, working with the for-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| and the non-profits like the IDB, we can make something happen on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| Whatever it may be, I hope my current colleagues and, I guess, ex-colleagues come September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| will look at this favorably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| And it may be some kind of a Karnes volunteer scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| I don't know. I don't know. I don't care just so it gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| Well, that's subscription now, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| All right, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| All right, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| The next item added to the agenda is discussion regarding the second district school board seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| Commissioner Bullock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| I was gratified to see all the comments on the forum regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| I know that there are some on the school board who would prefer that we leave that seat empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| It would certainly be easier on us as a commission to leave it empty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| but the people within the second district with whom I've communicated want representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| We're talking about three meetings, work sessions, and the beginning of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| So I'm all in favor of appointing someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| and I think having the interviews after next month's work session is a good plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| and then making the appointment during that regular voting meeting is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| I would like to ask that anyone who's interested in the appointment have their resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2377)|
| 0:39:45| and their cover letter into the commission office by close of business on August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| I'm setting up a public forum for members of the second district to come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| and hopefully all the commissioners will as well, to hear these candidates who want to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| I know everyone has their own opinion about whether to appoint someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| who is interested in only serving for the appointed term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| or whether they want to serve for the appointed term and run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| For a lot of us, it depends on the seat that we're appointing to and when the special election will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| My own personal feeling in this particular situation is that we are taking someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| and throwing them into the deep end of the ocean for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| They're going to have a lot of hard work to do and a lot of learning on a steep curve during those three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| which is going to make it really difficult to run an effective campaign during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| Currently, I'm in favor of appointing someone who's not interested in running for that seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| and then letting the second district make their choice during the special election of people who want to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2447)|
| 0:40:55| I've heard from over ten people who are interested in either the appointment or running for the seat or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2455)|
| 0:41:04| A lot of them have not made up their minds yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| but I think that the clearer we can be on our expectations of who we would like to appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| is going to make that process easier for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| I also want to make the point that during this public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| I hope a lot of people from the second district will come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| and I want to make the point that whoever we appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| it's important to recognize this should not be who any particular person in the county wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| It should not be who the commission wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| It should not be who the school board wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| The person that we appoint should be the person that the second district wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| and the second district has been through this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| and apparently there was an appointment that was planned to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| The commissioner at that time said, no, we're going to have a public forum and see what the public wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| and it turns out that the public wanted Dr. Paul Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| who ended up being an absolutely phenomenal, exceptional school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| So I hope that you will all keep that in mind as we move forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| that the most important opinion in this whole thing is the opinion of the residents of the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| and who they want appointed to this seat for three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| and then they can make their choice at the ballot box in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| Okay. We've had, the law director and I have had discussion, and we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| The timetable will be if we receive Ms. Kincannon's resignation before the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| which is next Monday, spread the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| and her effective date would be like August 7th or the day after that meeting, their first meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| and then we could appoint in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| If there's any delay after next week, it would put it into September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| So we'll need to talk to Andy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| But we do need to go ahead and let these people who are interested know a deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| of when they need to get their paperwork into the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Well, I think that we can have a deadline, but I think anybody from the floor can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| any commissioner can nominate anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| So the deadline would be more along the line for your public forum, I think, instead of just the commission selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| Yeah, that should be the most important consideration is who the second district has time to vet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| Yeah, I agree. I'm just, I mean, I think any, you know as well, anybody can come from a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| anybody can make any nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| I think we need to make sure, Jolie, if you'll make sure that the people that submit an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| blue live in the second district, and it's by address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| so let's make sure that we clear that through the election commission before we make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| So, if you don't care to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Let me ask, this is a law director question probably, and Amy said, what, 10 people have expressed interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| So, looking at, this is a theoretical, I guess, but usually it's 50 plus 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| If they're 10 and nobody gets a majority, is that waived?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| It doesn't have to go to a runoff, which would be in January or something, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Is that waived?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Yeah, this is unique, and it will be waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| In the election, it says they shall be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| It didn't say they shall be a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| They shall be elected, so this, whoever has the most votes in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| It's a win or take all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Win or take all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| And let me also say that I've heard from probably a dozen people with a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| I don't anticipate that all of them will put their name in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| I think a lot of them were just asking for information and thinking it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| and so I'm sure that not all of them will want to, will ultimately make that decision to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| or to go up for the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| But there's no lack of people who are interested at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| For the law director, just, Amy, I agree with what you're saying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| The only question, I'm sort of undecided as to what to do on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| if you're going to run for the position after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| I mean, who sets that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Did the board set that, or just was we individually vote, or is that, how do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| There's no law addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| That's a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| It's up to the commission how you all want to handle whatever it is you want to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| Well, I think each individual commissioner has to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| I don't think we can tell somebody they can't run for an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| I think that's improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| But you can make that decision, your vote, based on that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| I just wanted that open out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| The next item was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| It's discussion regarding the MPC article regarding Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| This article concerns the hiring of Dave Hill, who was let go by the city mayor when she took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2740)|
| 0:45:49| Without consulting the MPC or his bosses, I know that I've had some run-ins, let's say, with Donaldson over the past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2749)|
| 0:46:07| He sets a lot of precedents that he takes too much leeway with, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2767)|
| 0:46:16| To give you one good example was the transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2776)|
| 0:46:24| Hiring somebody for that office should be exactly like us hiring somebody for the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2784)|
| 0:46:36| It has to be done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| It's supposed to be done by the MPC commissioners, but they have slept off their duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| So my recommendation, I'd like to request that we ask our mayor to consult with the city mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2805)|
| 0:46:55| and get something done about this where they can set some procedures on who hires who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2815)|
| 0:47:04| It's going to wind up costing a bunch of money because to hire this guy, he fired the only woman in the management position the MPC had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2824)|
| 0:47:13| So you can bet there's going to be a good lawsuit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| But the two mayors have the responsibility of dictating policy to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| and they, in turn, should be dictating policy to Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| I think that conversation has been had, but I'll let the mayor know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| But I think he and Mayor O'Hara have already had some conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| Any other business before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Commissioner Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Yeah, I'm having a public meeting Friday at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| We're up at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| And since this is one of the last public meetings that I'll get to host before several of you leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| Mike and Ed and Larry and probably Richard and Tony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| and I would like for you all to come so that I can buy you a cup of coffee and a brownie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| No hot dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Well, actually, yes, I'll probably buy you a hot dog, too, if that's what you truly want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| Four hot dogs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| No, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| I'm on a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| So I hope that some of you all come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| There's not necessarily any business to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| but it would just be fun to hang out with you guys for a while, one last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| before you take off for your next assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| Do they serve beer at this place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Unfortunately, no, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Go ahead and go across the street over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Flats and taps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| My house is within walking distance, and we brew beer in the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| We have a question about the magistrate appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| When will these sessions, judges, be getting us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Do you have a timetable for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| I haven't heard from Brenda or from their assistant, but I will get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| and I think we'll get the names within the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| And we'll be vetting that, too, at our next meeting as well, as well as possible school boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| We'll have to manage interviews for school board and for judicial appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| Do we have anything for the chairman's lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| I've not heard from UT, so I'm assuming they're not going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| So we're not doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| We're doing chairman's lunch, but we don't have a host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| No, we have a host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Dr. Briggs is the host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Oh, Larry's the host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| I haven't heard from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Wait, I thought Larry did it last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| That was Dutch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| Oh, okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| It's Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Am I supposed to do it next month, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| All right, I'm cooking in August, so if you all have a specific thing you want, you need to let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| He got uprooted, didn't you, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| All right, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140721?start=2990)|
