| 0:05:33| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Oh, and Ms. Welch has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| Is this in the Holston building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=336)|

| 0:05:40| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Oh, sorry, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Hello, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Yes, we are in the lower level of the Holston building right there at Creech Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| We have the two floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| There's the basement and then the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| I do get asked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| Can you give us just a real quick update on what's happening with that project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Because this is a frequent question that I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| Sure, I can tell you what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| It's been about a week since I was over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| And Brad, our construction gentleman, foreman, the last time that I was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| he had gotten a permit to get the glass in, which will go along the, I call it the front side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| It's the side right there along Creech Park where the Christmas tree goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| He got a permit approved to put all that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| As far as I know, he's got the plumbing and there was a fire pole that had to be repainted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=389)|
| 0:06:37| And as far as I know, that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| So he's pretty close to doing the sheetrock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| And then we'll get our certificate of occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| and be able to put our decorating in and hopefully be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| What's your hoped timeline on completion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| I don't have an exact timeline because the part that I'll be involved in will be post-certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=413)|
| 0:07:02| And I haven't actually asked Brad that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| So whatever I would say would not really mean much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=432)|

| 0:09:14| Thanks for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Just a quick question on your compliance plan, your server compliance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Is this a 21 and over only area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Well, typically during the day we'll do 18 and up or family friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| But we still have people at the front door carting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| And then at night we do 21 and up to make sure that we are able to patrol everybody more accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| I just want to note that your server compliance plan was a little bit vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=581)|

| 0:09:43| It's a very vague question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| What we do every day is we have – during the day we don't have people watching the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| but we ID at the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| But at night we have doormen that watch the door and make sure that everybody is 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| After what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=600)|

| 0:10:38| Again, this is for the outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| This is prior to newer council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| This is an ordinance that we worked on to allow outdoor sales on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| and Cumberland Avenue Street on a special permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| So anyway, appreciate both you, you all, cooperation in getting this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| It was a little – it'll be easier for the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=654)|

| 0:11:06| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Just also just a little bit vague on the compliance plan and just, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| no service to anyone without a valid ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=672)|

| 0:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| I mean, it very likely is a formality, but that's a checkbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| I just didn't see that in any protocol online or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| It's on the checklist for your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| It is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1254)|

| 0:20:58| Well, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Could you tell us a little bit about the Furry Fall Festival?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| I think we're all familiar with Mardi Gras, but I haven't heard of the Furry Fall Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| So that event is actually at Young-Williams Animal Center, so you can see all of our available pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| And it's free to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| It'll be Sunday, November 4th from 12 until 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| And it's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| We have a kid's zone with inflatables and free stuff, face painting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| and it's one of our largest fundraisers of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| We'll also offer just $10 microchips and vaccines for the public who are at a low cost, you know, a low cost option for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1283)|
| 0:21:32| So we'll also have more than 40 vendors, everything from boutiques to pet-friendly vendors as well for dogs and cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1292)|
| 0:21:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1301)|

| 0:22:24| Just lacking, I believe, the building inspection and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| So I'd like to request a 6-day extension on that if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| So I'd like to request a 6-day extension on that if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1353)|

| 0:22:45| So the first one you're asking for a 60-day extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| I think opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| The first one's the on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Which one are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1373)|

| 0:23:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1383)|

| 0:23:21| Motion to extend 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1401)|

| 0:25:24| security to make sure that we are not serving minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| One of the biggest ones was putting more signs up and more training for the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| on a quarterly basis about IDs, and we're IDing everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| And we also, when they're ringing in the drinks, we put the birth date on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| little chit when it goes back into the computer, and if there's no ID on the chit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| then the bartender's not making the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| And at that point, if they don't put that in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| then the bartender has to see the ID just as a layer of precaution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| so that way we do not serve another minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| I have a question for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| I have a question concerning the bartender with the chip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| So if a table orders four drinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| will the bartender enter four date of births or just one for that table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| for that particular order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| They're going to put a date of birth for every single drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| Like the way that our system works is you can see C1, C2, C3, C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| and if there's not a birthday under every single drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| then that's when they're going to ask the server to go get the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| and we're going to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| The other thing that we laid in was that if there's any question of any ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| to bring it to the manager so the manager can take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| and go talk to that guest as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| When was the chip program implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| When was that put in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| It was implemented the day after we got stung, basically right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| because I want to put a layer of precaution in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| This particular server looked at the ID, did the math wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| so he was IDing them, made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| But I also think that we just need to have that other layer in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| just so that we are making sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| because if he would have put that birthday in there being wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| then the bartender would have seen it and said, wait, wait, wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| this person is not 21, and so that's my main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| Absolutely, because this is pretty serious offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| and you guys are now two within a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Mr. Speier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| So the instance you were first talking about, was that the one in 2017?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| In 2017, I wasn't at the restaurant then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| I saw the original and remedial plan, and we went over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| so we didn't have that layer of security in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Now in the second time that we got hit on July 25th, I believe was the date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Of 2018?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| I laid in that plan to put the birthdays on the computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| Do you know what happened, just secondhand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| what happened in the May 2017 sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Yes, it was the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Basically, the particular server, both of these servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| we got terminated immediately for what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| But the first one was the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| The only difference was that there was four people that came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| and they didn't ID them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| So in the 2007 they didn't ID, the 2018 ID, but they still sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| They still sold it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| That was what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| In 2017, I was there with the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| The server did not ask for ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| My officer said in 2018 that the server just gave it a cursory glance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1728)|
| 0:28:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Yes, sir, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Mr. Frost, I guess my question is to you then, having heard this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| what are the options for beer board this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| There are two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| First is do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| That's because you're satisfied with the remedial plan that's been set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| The second option is someone would have to make a motion to send them to the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1760)|
| 0:29:28| for potential other punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| And if they get another violation within a certain time frame, what are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| I believe off the top of my head if you get three violations in a rolling two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| you'd go straight to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| I've definitely looked through this, and obviously you understand how serious this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| And I could see that in the action plan and your presentation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| Just like Mr. Frost said, if you have another instance like this occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| you're going to go straight to a hearing as opposed to coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| But I do feel satisfied with the plan that you've come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| and your discussion about it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| So I'm going to suggest that we don't take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| I have a follow-up question regarding the CHIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| And as the officer alluded, the server just kind of glanced at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| So as busy as a restaurant is, they're going to sit there and they're going to look at everyone's ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| and when I'm taking their order, I'm going to write down the date of birth next to each drink order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| And as busy as the bartender is, the bartender is going to put all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| put those date of births in for each drink that's sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Yes, so it's the servers and the bartenders, both of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| putting those birthdays in the computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| But the server is going to take the drink order, put the ID on a piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| and then as he goes and wrings it in under each drink, there's actually like we have Aloha| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| and it's like a computer system, and he or she can key that birthday in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| And then that birthday, when the ticket prints off at the bar for the bartender to make those drinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| then it appears on the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| And if it did not on the check, then they're not going to make the drink for that server to take to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| And all of your employees have been trained on this process, bartenders as well as servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Yeah, we implemented it into, we trained everybody that was currently on the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| and then we implemented it into our training that we do each week with new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| So you have a motion to accept his report and then no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| So no motion needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| We accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Hopefully you have good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Hope your system works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| You all have a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| No further business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180828?start=1925)|
