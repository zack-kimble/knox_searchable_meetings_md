| 0:00:00| Okay, if we could go ahead and get our seats, we'll get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| I would like to welcome you to the joint workshop of the Knoxville City Council and the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=5)|
| 0:00:10| County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=10)|
| 0:00:12| It's Thursday, November the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=12)|
| 0:00:14| It's 5-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=14)|
| 0:00:15| And, as usual, we'd like to start the meeting with an invocation and a pledge, and I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=15)|
| 0:00:20| to ask Mayor Brown if you would lead us in the invocation, please, and Councilman Grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=20)|
| 0:00:25| to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=25)|
| 0:00:27| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=27)|
| 0:00:28| Let's bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=28)|
| 0:00:29| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this, another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=29)|
| 0:00:33| We ask that thou would go with us and guide us as we seek to deliberate on the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=33)|
| 0:00:38| of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=38)|
| 0:00:39| We ask a special blessing upon those who are less fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=39)|
| 0:00:44| Forgive us for all of our sins and thank you for all your blessings, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=44)|
| 0:00:49| Let's pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=49)|
| 0:00:50| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=50)|
| 0:00:56| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=56)|
| 0:01:09| Okay, any comments, Chairman Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| No, sir, I'd go ahead and get started, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| Okay, I guess we'll go ahead and get started, and I'd like to introduce now Steve Joyner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| Dr. Steve Joyner from Lipscomb University, who has agreed to come back for what hopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| to be the last meeting, facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| Dr. Joyner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| I hope it's the last one, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| You're getting tired of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| It's great to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| I don't think I've seen a full crowd tonight up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| There's a lot of good-looking people and a few that aren't sitting on this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| I'll talk about you, Mike, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| Before we begin tonight, I want to, once again, as we get together and we talk tonight, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| my understanding tonight is that we're coming down to kind of the end of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| We're on the five-yard line of this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| and we're looking at those last few changes, some of that language that's involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| and ways that we can kind of come to good conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| But I also know that the last five yards are the hardest five yards to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| And so tonight I'm really looking forward to having this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| and I will say this, that five yards will get there if you decide we want to get there tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| We've got about an hour and 45 minutes to have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| We want to stay on task and stay focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| My goal tonight is for us to map some ideas, set a direction of where we want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| look at some of the language, discuss that language, be able to shape that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| To do that, there's some ground rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| I want us to remember you guys all know what they are, but I'm going to point this out once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| One is I was brought here for the specific job of helping the two bodies deal with legislative language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| And so tonight, for the purpose of this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| we're going to focus on kind of the three documents that you were sent out of this legislative group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| I know there are other documents floating around that are good, hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| has gone into those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Those documents need to be dealt with in your legislative bodies, perhaps in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| But we're going to focus on the three documents that you had because that's the work that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| kind of process integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| I'm kind of required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Now, if you have any ideas that you want to add to that, it can come from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| and we're certainly willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| It's my understanding, Councilman Bailey, that this is a closed mic session, not this is a working session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| That's what we agreed upon last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| I think 10 public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| So I think it's time for us now to move on with the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| If I could speak to that, Councilman, the 14th and the 21st are the commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| The workshop is the 14th at 2 o'clock in the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Tony, is this on the zoning agenda or is this on the regular agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| I think it's on the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| So 2 o'clock there will be discussion, public discussion at that time also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| The 14th and the 21st at 2 o'clock, both meetings, you can come and have public discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| That would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| A couple of things I want to remind you of, and someone asked me about this recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| I kind of would have thought this far into it, it would be understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| But the question is, where do I serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Do I serve as a neutral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| I am completely a neutral in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| My job is to facilitate the conversation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| I have no dog in this fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| And I have not, no one spoken to me or influenced me in any way, one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| outside of the public meetings or the general conversations we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| So if there's any question about that, I wanted to confirm that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| Finally, in terms of process integrity, we're going to spend the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=290)|
| 0:04:58| we're going to map what we're going to do with our time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| because we've kind of got to use it pretty proficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| You notice there's three documents in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| Look at those, Phyllis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| I believe you can put them in this order, because I believe this is how we're going to work through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| First, we're going to work through the proposed revisions in Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| Those are the revisions that really came from our work back in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| And by the way, the temperature is much different than the last time I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| But you see the revision proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| We will put those on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| It says proposed revisions for Section 2, and we'll discuss each of those proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| work on that language, and see how comfortable you are with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| Once we work through that material, then we will move to the discussion of the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=340)|
| 0:05:48| the appendices, which are points to address in the implementation phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| which is the work primarily, if I understand, of Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| That discussion is going to be primarily about, you know, do you want to have this addendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| the purpose of this, and how that's added to the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| And finally, then, we will look at the action checklist that was put together by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| And the issues there are the checklist, what role does it play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| is that a part of your document, or is that an advisory kind of role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| a suggestion for you as you move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| Is that making sense to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Those are the three ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| I think that moves us through the general discussion of this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| and hopefully we have moved that fairly quickly and get us to a place that you can leave this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| and you can go to your bodies and you can take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| Any questions anybody has before we move forward on this discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Yes, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Steve, I handed you a piece of paper and everyone on this panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| and it was an attempt, in my mind, to deal with the flexibility issue in a very short form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| So if we get time, and we may not, we could address that as two sentences long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| but it's kind of a tone in the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| And I tell you what, I'm going to lean on your opinion of when best to insert that, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=433)|
| 0:07:22| When would you like to have that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| It really isn't different to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| I would leave it to the chair people who are running this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| but I started today spending some time with a really long document from the chamber with all the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| I tried to put in two sentences the thought process that at least I was conveying during earlier meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| and trying to edit the entire document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| I think what we'll do then, I see what you're saying, is we'll finish this revision discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| and between the revision discussion and moving into your addendum, we'll bring that particular one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| I think actually that needs to be read now because it kind of sets a tone for the whole meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| It puts together what we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| I have the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| Here is, I think I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| Here is a statement that, well, why don't you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Would you do that, Councilman, read that on the front end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| It's an insert to probably the second or third paragraph in the preface where they're describing the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| and what they're setting out to do, and it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| this general plan amendment sets forth the vision in primary means to be used to safely develop steep land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| without causing off-site environmental damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| There's a semicolon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| And it recognizes that implementation of these general objectives depends upon future adoption of ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| and regulations by the legislative bodies of the city and county governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| The plan likewise recognizes that flexibility will be needed in applying these general goals and principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| to specific proposals and site conditions on unique parcels of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| and leaves room for approval of creative engineering and varying solutions to meet these objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| And, again, it was the idea of it's not a straight jacket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| It's spandex, and it has a little flex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| And that's the discussion we ended with last time, and we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| Anybody, and if you use your lights for me, that will help so I can make sure I'm not ignoring anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| Does anybody, before we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| I think this is a really interesting overview of Councilman Della Vopi's view of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| Does anybody want to add to that or comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| I'm not sure we're going to work the language of this so much, since it's not the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| but it's an interesting kind of overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Does anybody want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| I think this, for a lot of us, is absolutely essential if we're going to pass a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| particularly the last part about having the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| I just think if we end up with a plan that we have to vote on where it's so rigid that when somebody comes up with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=587)|
| 0:09:56| creative, a different way of doing business that's good, you know the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| then that would allow us to really go outside the plan because it preserves all the things that we want to preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=600)|
| 0:10:09| regardless of whether they're aesthetic, whether they're to prevent stormwater damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| I think this thing about off-site property damage, if someone comes up with a plan, then we're still able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| I think the key is we cannot have any language in here that would set up a legal bar to doing something that we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=622)|
| 0:10:31| that meets in every other way the criteria of what the plan generally is trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| So I agree with that completely, that we need to have that in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| and be certain that there's no other language in the plan that prevents us from doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| So what I hear from Commissioner Briggs is that you don't want to throw the baby out with the bath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| but you feel really strongly that the plan has to be flexible enough to manage what comes down the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| and you're concerned that the plan itself not have language that is in competition with that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=658)|
| 0:11:06| Does that sound about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| Commissioner McKenzie, I'll tell you what you all did do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| You had the Council and Commission all mix up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| You know how much stress is with remembering which one you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| So go ahead, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| If I call you the wrong thing, please don't be upset with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Sam works, so that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| I agree with everything Commissioner Briggs said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| I just don't, and again, it's how we place it, where we place it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| I don't want this to be considered kind of an all-inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| This, to me, and the initial part of it reads that it's simply an environmental damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=699)|
| 0:11:48| There's other aspects that I think kind of weigh into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| And then not to necessarily wordsmith it, but a term like creative engineer scares me to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=712)|
| 0:12:01| You know, that can be just about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| I mean, you know, if I have a monstrosity there, but it's engineered to meet, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| to check all the boxes that I'm just throwing out for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| So, you know, again, I don't want to wordsmith it, but, you know, it has to be sound as well or standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=731)|
| 0:12:19| Well, not standard, but sound, you know, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| So I don't want to just do a cut and paste with this, but in general, let me say that, you know, I agree that this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=741)|
| 0:12:29| General, you agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| There's some phraseology there that you want to make sure that this is a sound statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| and that you're not opening the door for some kind of completely off-the-wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| inappropriate kind of engineering to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Sound is a good addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| I think there ought to be sound engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Add that to that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Commissioner Norman, you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| Yes, I'd like to affirm what Sam just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| And we have a phrase that we use a lot of times in meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| We don't do math in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| And I don't like to edit and write in public either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| And so this is really that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| There's a couple of phrases in here that are troublesome to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| So certainly that creative engineering and safely develop on steep land without causing off-site damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| I mean, do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| So there's phrases in here that are troublesome, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| And my question coming back is, in general, do you find that, Commissioner Norman, in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| do you find that page reassuring or troubling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| No, no, just some of the phrases there are troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| I agree with the idea that flexibility, we've talked about flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| We have emphasized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| We spent at least two sessions of our facilitated sessions talking about trying to make sure that takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| And so certainly we want to be able to accommodate some novel approaches to steep slope development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=832)|
| 0:14:00| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| About putting this in an insert, like an overarching statement that's kind of, it could have an effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| I'm a little troubled about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Commissioner Brown, do you want to add to that before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Yes, just for a minute or so here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| The reason I ask that we put it forth in the beginning here because I think generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| and I'll emphasize that word, it brings out the purpose for which we have been meeting for all these months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=862)|
| 0:14:30| and the committee for those three years to do some of these things that does offer some protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| We could spend the next five years nitpicking any plan bit by bit by bit down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| but this is not the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| A general plan which allows this flexibility, when we come to do these ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| that's the time when you lock down the dotting the I's and crossing the T's, but that's not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| I reason we want to do that beforehand so we don't spend another hour doing that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| I'm not going to let that happen because what I want to say with this, it's really interesting because you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| and I love what Commissioner Norman says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| You don't want to do math in public, and you really don't want to edit in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| That's a long process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| At the same time, I hear, and I'm going to come back to Ms. Burrells here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| By the way, you switched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| You're not Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| I sort of called you Sam for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| That, in general, I'm hearing the same thing, which is we like the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| We have questions about how we're going to phrase all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| and that can be wordsmithed in another legislative environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| but so far you're hearing that we're getting to the point where we see this plan as flexible and doable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| and it's got to stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| That's what I'm hearing from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| I'm going to come back to Ms. Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Sir, I was going to say that it seems to me that all we need out of this is just one sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| and that would be the plan recognizes that flexibility will be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| in applying these general goals and principles to specific parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| and site conditions on unique parcels of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| That says it all without, you know, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| that's the only sentence that we need to state what all of this means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| What I would say to do this is with your chairs, your legislative leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| you guys sit down and you can work on that particular phraseology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| What I love about this, and I appreciate you doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| and you've done this a couple times, Forest Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| is you've kind of come in and seen a lot of things and brought it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| You've got a gift at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| I might want to get you a graduate degree so you can just do this for a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| but you kind of brought that to the point that I think for the most part we agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| It's a flexible document that we plan to use to advise us as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| And so I'll let you guys work on the exact phraseology of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| but that's a wonderful way to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Let's move forward and begin to talk about some of the revision language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| I don't think it will be incredibly complicated because most of this we've done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1013)|
| 0:17:02| So what I want to do is just confirm the work that has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| and the revisions that will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| To see the proposal, revision number one, hopefully you've read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| is that it combines the previous proposed subgroups of 1, 40 to 50 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| and 2, 50 or more percent, into a single 40 percent or more slope subdivision group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| You can see how that works out on the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| And I may ask, Mark, would you be available here if they have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| on the language and the page work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| But you'll see the characteristics of the ridge top on page 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| and you go a step further and you'll actually see the implications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| which is at page 3 at page 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| And the big change is within table 3 on page 3 in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| You see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| The language I think is important to see there is 40 percent or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| You've got the .2 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| and the recommended maximum land disturbance factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| they've raised that to 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| That's the improvement we made or the changes we made in our last discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| And then a couple things that jumped out at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| and I'd like you guys to talk about or discuss, are the starred areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| Right below it, star number one, these factors should be considered guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| to determine overall recommended residential density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| Star two, until such a time as regulations are codified by appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| legislative body, these factors are considered guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| So the language seems to fit that we've basically put it to 40 percent or up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| We've upped, if I understand, is this correct, Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| you know this better than I do, we've upped the percentage on the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| disturbance factor on 25 and 40 percent from 15 or maybe 10 to 20 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1135)|
| 0:19:02| and also allowed dwelling units at 40 percent or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| You guys, is that an accurate description of what we've done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| Mark, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Are you comfortable with that language and that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Does that seem to meet the flexibility model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| You guys are easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| Notice here on page four, recommended zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| Plan, commercial zone, and so, Phyllis, if you'd make note of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| of the agreement on the density and page three, the density and slope discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1183)|
| 0:19:51| On page four, you'll notice page 36, left-hand column, recommended zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| We changed the wording from must to should, trying, I believe, to enter that mode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| to be more flexible and not in those kind of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| And then page 47, you'll also notice that the 40 percent or more has been also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| added to the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| That's been combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| And now that the minimum proposed lot size is now five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| and the land-to-surface factor is 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1222)|
| 0:20:30| Everybody comfortable with that and that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| We're just walking through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| We want to make sure everybody understands what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| That has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| And put that down as an agreement, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| which would be the change from must to should for more flexible language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| That's page 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| Then page 47, the agricultural zone increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1259)|
| 0:21:13| Section two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1273)|
| 0:21:24| And those are really the changes within that section two revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Before I move on, then, to discussion on the implementation phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| everybody comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I want to make sure you go have your discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| you understood what happened, what the changes were, and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| Now go to what I call the Della Vope appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1302)|
| 0:21:50| We're not going to go through these step by step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| but what I would like to do is I'm going to put Commissioner Della Vope on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| I'd like you to, just in a couple of sentences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| describe what you hope to accomplish with this appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Well, of course, this was, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| MPC's effort to boil down the three or four pages of things that probably go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| ordinances more than in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| But the idea was that for this to be successful, it has to be implemented wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| So training is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| The idea of surety bonding to make sure that the precautions get put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| and if they don't, there's money for the government entity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| And then some of the descriptions to me are almost so general I don't quite get to tie them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| but the idea was they were summarizing the subject matter of the way to do development on steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| and make it sort of blend in and not disturb too much land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| And so by putting it as guidelines, it's somewhat harmless, I think, because it's very general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| But, again, I think they were trying to say what's the essence of this effort of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| how do you contour grade, how do you prepare the site, how do you narrow the clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| how do you make sure it gets done, how do you make sure that we have proper inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| So I don't have any problem with MPC's idea of just listing it to kind of a checklist for things you should look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| and we can all worry about word merchanting later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| The word merchant goes later when you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| It goes later for the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| For the ordinance kind of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| But you're comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| The word merchanting was attempted on the front end because I was trying to illustrate if you got real specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| you'd make it easier for a developer to analyze the requirements against a site's characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| and make a decision on financially whether he wanted to spend his time and money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Do you have, this is a rather, you know, they've done a great job of bringing it down to one page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| but there are also, are there any general ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Like you said, I think the councilman said, you know, that actually wording can be done within legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| But are there any questions about the general ideas, first of all, of this document, of this page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Are we good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| I guess it's a question of placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| So, and maybe it's more of a form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| It's, Mark, I mean, are you anticipating this sliding at the end of the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| not really referenced as a you shall in the actual plan, and then say per appendix I, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1464)|
| 0:24:35| that kind of brings it in as a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| I just want to make sure that that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Because I like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| It sounds like it's just kind of a user's guide to how you get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| We envisioned adding this as an appendix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| and we have not gone through the plan to make references to it in very specific places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| But it does summarize those recommendations that are included in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| I would just, you know, ask your careful consideration not to somehow, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1501)|
| 0:25:09| fumble it up on a reference and it somehow gets confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| and someone takes it to mean something that you really had no intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Can you help me out with this, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| Because remember, I'm from another state that thinks slower, so you help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| What I hear you saying, basically, is you find this to be a good guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| You're uncomfortable with this being added as a part of the document in terms of a regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| You see this as a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Right, unless that's what we want to do, make it a regulation, and then that's what we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| But it doesn't sound like that's what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| And I just want to make sure we don't fumble it up by making a strong statement in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| say see appendix I for, well, the appendix as something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| And so you're saying that on top, the side, and the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| you don't want to then reference it during the plan, which brings it into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Could bring it into the end, right, once we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| Does that make sense to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| The language that we used in the lead paragraph referring to it as a checklist, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| captures our vision of what the intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| And can you confirm with him you won't use that kind of language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| We have not made any reference to this appendix in the body of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| I want to come back then to Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Looking through these to answer possibly Sam's concerns there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| I don't see anything that is cut and dried to the point that it is specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1592)|
| 0:26:43| It says something, in fact, that we want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| This is an area that we need to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| It doesn't specifically say you've got to do number one, two, and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| That comes later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| But I think these are addressing areas that need to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| but it's not specifically stating now how they will be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1617)|
| 0:27:06| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| I just don't want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| And what you want is to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| So this becomes not a discussion of the document itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| but placement and understanding of the role of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| And you agreed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| I think that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Anybody else have a disagreement or want to talk about that before we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| So what I understand, in my summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| is that the two bodies are comfortable with this particular appendix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| which is a general outline of the implementation issues that are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| It can be added as an appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| It is not considered a part of this document in terms of requirement of regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| It can be a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| And you're comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Understanding, according to Commissioner Della Volpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| this is not detailed enough that you would necessarily use this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| for any kind of ordinance work anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| That work would have to come later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Does that seem fair and reasonable to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| What's the difference between having something of this actually in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| and having it as an annex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| I have a little bit of trouble with it because it starts to include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| it does have some specifics there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| and we're talking about code revisions and guidelines and standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| When you're starting to talk about standards, that is a little bit more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| And when you say we're going to put it in as an appendix, but it's not part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| it's an appendix to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| I mean, does anybody want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| First of all, let me say I think these are good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| or these are things that are going to need to be addressed in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| as to what we want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| But does it need to be in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| It will be by ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Well, I guess the question I hear, though, I think you two, everybody's agreeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| but here's the question I hear that Commissioner Briggs bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| and you guys help me with this, are you asking the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| if this is really good stuff and it's going to be done by ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| is there even a need to put it in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| I'm not saying it's good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| It does have to be addressed, and we can deliberate on that later, but does it need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| Does it even need to be attached?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| As a document or something in the plan, because what I think of something as an appendix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| it's something that's, you know, that's hanging on there in addition to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| Use your mic there, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| But it says, though, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| It says these are points to address in the implementation stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| That's the thing that you work on when you get this approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| You work on these things to build the ordinances to make it a viable document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| So Commissioner Brown's coming back saying there is a role for it, according to Commissioner Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| which this becomes the foundation they're going to work on to build our viable documents later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| And I hear Commissioner Briggs say, well, I'm just wondering whether you even need it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| It may be better off just to address it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| So we've got two different kind of approaches on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| Commissioner Briggs, do you want to respond to his idea that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| we need that to kind of lay the foundation for our ordinance work later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1805)|
| 0:30:14| Well, once the ordinances are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| I might be agreeing with him and I might be disagreeing, but I haven't decided yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| But once the ordinances are done, these all become moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| But these are things that they're saying, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| these are things we need to look at to make this thing complete, to make it a workable document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| Do you want to comment on this particular strain of conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| I think that Commissioner Brown made the statement that once the ordinances are passed and the plan's in gear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| most of these will become moot because they will have been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| I'm afraid if they're not included as an appendix and a part of the overall document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| that down the road as we have changes in personnel on the commission and council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| we have four new council members coming in in a couple or three weeks, I'm afraid that this will become lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| And those of us who were here tonight will have great memories, but those who come later or whatever, we will forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| So this is why I think it would be important for it to be a part of the appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| And as Commissioner Brown said, over time this would become moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| I have a little less concern because I think Mark Donaldson has a very good memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| and he's probably going to be here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| So I don't think he'll let us forget just because there's no amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| And the great thing about this, nobody's debating the work of what this can do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| What we're talking about is where we're going to place it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| So I want to clarify that in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| I want to go to Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| You want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| I think primarily what this was was an acknowledgment in the facilitated sessions of Councilman Della Volpe's work and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1910)|
| 0:32:01| and good work that he was emphasizing some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| All of these things are mentioned or alluded to within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| I think everything in here is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| And so I see this list as probably formally being, as a formal appendix would be, be referenced in the document with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1934)|
| 0:32:27| parenthetically, see appendix, whatever item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| I'm not sure exactly how Mr. Donaldson wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| But I see all of these things as important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| And the staffers, the professionals in the field are saying, yeah, we like these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1959)|
| 0:32:48| and we think they ought to be included and we're going to reference them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| So it came from our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| He did a good job with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| And we wanted to acknowledge that he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| Kind of coming back now, Commissioner Briggs, in light of that discussion, kind of what are you thinking about at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1978)|
| 0:33:07| You know, I guess as long as it's just something that says as a reference, I don't have any strong objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| Again, I might have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| I don't know if I even have an objection, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| I'd probably just want to think about it some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| But these things are starting to get a little bit more thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| Pretty detailed, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Yeah, a little bit more detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| And this is going to be things that we're going to have to address individually when it comes up to some of these code revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| I mean, actually in some ways the code revisions are going to be more flexible in that we can have narrow roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| We can do things that we're not permitted to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| But I tell you, probably listening to what Tony said, I probably don't have as much of an objection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| I mostly just wanted to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Are we being too specific at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| So we're aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| The next item is going to have the same discussion attached, I believe, which is the action item list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| You know, what role does that play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| So where we sit now from what I hear, and I want you guys to help clarify this with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| is that this is NPC's attempt then to kind of distill down the good work of the councilman into a page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2054)|
| 0:34:24| This is intended to be guideline reference work only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| The actual wordsmithing and codification of this work will be done during the ordinance phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| There was some discussion about whether it should be placed as an appendix or whether it's too detailed for that and gets us off track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2075)|
| 0:34:44| But after discussion, for the most part, the body here says, you know, it does play a role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| because it does remind people now and people in the future of what we need to accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| but it is not intended then to be referenced in the body as things that people need to turn to as requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2095)|
| 0:35:04| for how they go about doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| That's a nice, simple statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| This is not in this document right now, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| It would be added as the last appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| This is really not appendix one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| It's appendix I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| It's appendix I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Yeah, I called it one because my Roman numeral and all my stuff, that's all the Latin I took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| So it's appendix I for those of you who were listening to me and got thoroughly confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| You know, actually, it is in this right here under the points to address in the implementation phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| I mean, this is in the revised document that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| It is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| It's just not labeled as appendix I, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| He was saying it's in the document they got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| It's about the next to the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Yeah, the proposed addition of section three actually includes a lot of the items that are mentioned in appendix I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2155)|
| 0:36:07| No, this is word for word exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| If you look at appendix H, you almost can't tell where appendix H ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| and this last thing begins in this copy that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| So it's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| I think that came from the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| It came from the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| So Mark may not have that document readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| So Commissioner Briggs might be looking at the chamber version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Well, the one that I have that came from the chamber, it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| But it's not labeled as appendix I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| It sort of looks like a continuation of appendix H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| But you're saying the official document you have, it's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| The starting point that we're dealing with is the version of the plan is adopted by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| Appendix H is a summary of development incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Is there anything after appendix H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| And appendix H is the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| So that's actually the other document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| We're working off different documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| You notice up here, by the way, I don't know if I've acknowledged this in the six weeks we've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| The brains of the outfit actually stands behind me, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Phyllis does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| I just talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| But Phyllis has been doing the work up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| And you notice that on the wall we're putting a green tag beside places we've come to agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| Now, with this particular one, we were in the yellow territory now for a while there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| But I want to get consensus back on that last statement I gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| Is this group in consensus that this particular document could stand as appendix I, as general guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2253)|
| 0:37:41| but not to be in some kind of regulatory codified manner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| Is everybody at least comfortable with that at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Anybody not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| Then we're in the green territory now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| And then the last one, and I think this is interesting because I think the discussion of add a section 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| implementation action step, there's a couple of levels I think we need to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| One of those is the exact level of placement again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| What's the role of this in light of the document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| And second, how we got there and what's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| I guess, Mark, would you just take a couple of minutes to describe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| I understand this came, you were asked to do this, and this came out of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| MPC staff drafted this proposed section as a result of listening to your facilitated meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2313)|
| 0:38:43| and realizing that there really needed to be a step-by-step listing of how you use a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2323)|
| 0:38:52| And so we tried to do this in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| And at the same time tie it back to state law regarding the general plan, insert some language giving you flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2335)|
| 0:39:07| and then continuing that checklist sort of approach that Councilman Della Volpe started with his paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2347)|
| 0:39:15| and putting that in as an implementation strategy as part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2355)|
| 0:39:24| More and more land use and general plans are becoming strategic in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| and action steps and implementation are an important part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| So there's multiple benefits to adding this section, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2374)|
| 0:39:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| So I want to have this discussion about this section at two levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| One would be the actual action plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Have you guys read over it enough to be conversant in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| Because it is my understanding that the MPC has offered this to you as their suggestions of how to move forward in the action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2395)|
| 0:40:05| Anybody have opinions of that, about that, specifically the action plan itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2405)|
| 0:40:29| I'm giving you guys a couple minutes to look it over if you haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2429)|
| 0:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2459)|
| 0:41:29| As you read through it, anybody here gotten far enough or read it before that have some impression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2489)|
| 0:41:56| either positively or negatively, or guidance in terms of the action plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| Just while everyone's looking at this, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Again, I'm not saying I'm for or against anything, but just on this very back page on four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| they're talking about timber cutting and logging and some of the reforestation requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2530)|
| 0:42:18| Do we have the authority as a county, if the land where they're doing the timber cutting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| some of that may fall under, I would think it would fall under some of the state regulations as to what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| If you're using your timber and your logging as part of an agricultural activity, can we, I'm just asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2551)|
| 0:42:39| can we do anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| I would think the answer was no, but I'm just asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| I'll ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| And also, if council has something to say about that, that would be great, but I'm going to start over here at the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| You cannot use the zoning ordinance to prohibit any agricultural uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| and timbering has been determined to be an agricultural use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| But there are places that regulate that use by creating standards for reconditioning the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2583)|
| 0:43:13| creating requirements for phasing of the activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| In a development scenario, many communities will, if they allow timber harvesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| then say that the property is prohibited from any other development for a period of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| So you can manage that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| You cannot prohibit agricultural activity through the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| You don't want to do anything that would serve to be violative or in conflict with the State Right to Farm Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| And if that were the case, that would prevail and we would ensure that that would not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| Anything you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| I would just simply say that state law always supersedes local law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| So if there's a state law that governs the subject, the state law will prevail over anything you try to do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| That does not mean that you can't, in some cases, supplement state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| It just depends on the extent to which the state law occupies the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| If you've got a state law that is so comprehensive that it occupies the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| then a local government may not pass a law in that area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| And then in some areas where they have just passed some regulations but not completely occupied the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| then the local government can adopt rules, regulations, and laws which in some way supplement the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| so long as they do not conflict with the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| And so what I'm hearing, and I may not have this right, is that that language may not be completely useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2685)|
| 0:44:56| The question then becomes do you reword it or do you leave it there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| and understand it may be superseded by state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Is that a correct assessment of what I heard said by both groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Again, we'll know just by looking at the plain language of the statute if it's preemptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| The state normally outlines a specificity that a whole body of law is preempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| But, again, merely because the Right to Farm Act exists doesn't mean anything we do relative to agriculture is hands off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2717)|
| 0:45:25| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Dr. Briggs, you have your light still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Do you want to go further or something else you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| Any other impact or view or anything you'd like to add about this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| about the actual substance of this particular checklist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2739)|
| 0:45:52| I'm going to ask the big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| I'm on substance at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Are you in agreement that you find the substance of this checklist to be useful in your work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2755)|
| 0:46:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I don't know if we're getting a vote out of it, but I just kind of want to hear somebody say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| no, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| That's what I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Now the question becomes back then, again to the question that Commissioner Briggs asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| what is the appropriate place for this checklist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| The question I'm asking you is back to the addendum idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| Mark, what was the intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| Did you plan to place this also as an addendum to the document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| The current body of the plan is made up of two sections plus a set of appendices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| Section one is background material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Section two is the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| And we propose this as a new section three implementation and action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| So it would be inserted after section two, but not a part of the appendices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| And if I heard you correctly, this is important for you to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| you're adding this as a section of the plan, not an appendices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| So the proposal from MPC is this be added as a section of the plan, not an appendices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| And does anybody see that as a problem, see that as getting in the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| or being an issue in implementation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| I guess I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| You got the light there, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| We have to work your light here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| I don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| I was going to ask a question maybe to the lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| This is like a healthy thing in the sense that it says things you should be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| as you go downstream over the next several years to try to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| Does the saying of that put you at any kind of risk that you have to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| or is that just, like it says, a recommendation that you can accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| or reject as the spirit moves the legislative body of the moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| I mean, that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| And the placement within the body of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| I don't have a problem with where it is in the text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| and I think that's fine as the implementation as section three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| In other words, does it have a value that says, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| you're now falling behind the general plan and have done something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| or is it a helpful tool to let you go through the process of legislating to fill in the blanks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2889)|
| 0:48:17| We're just a little unclear exactly which provision you're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| No, but the whole section three, the idea that you set out a series of action steps as a planning recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| I believe that as it's set out here, it simply provides a road map for future action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2913)|
| 0:48:42| And unless that future action is actually taken, it's not really going to be enforceable one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| I think these are in the form of guidelines as to how you implement the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| And this is the process that you go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| But until that process has been followed, I don't believe you have anything that is strictly enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2937)|
| 0:49:05| It's advisory in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| Yeah, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Now, after you've actually taken action and somebody wants to challenge the action that you've taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| and you have a lawsuit, and as a part of that lawsuit, the lawyer who's opposing it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| they were supposed to do this, this, and this because it says so in this action plan, and they didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| Will that win the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| Who knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| I don't know until some judge tells me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| But you say, in general, it's your view that's an advisory, but anybody can sue you and any judge can say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2973)|
| 0:49:40| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Is that what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| That's pretty accurate, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| That's pretty good for a non-lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| I was impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Coming back to it, why don't you respond to that and I'll come back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| I used to work with a guy that would say you could sue the Bishop of Boston for bastardy, but you won't make it stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| You just need $147 and go down to the courthouse and file some papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| No, so I understood counsel to say that this is really to help us see things that we could be doing as legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=2999)|
| 0:50:07| to get further along the path that someone couldn't necessarily make you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| I suppose if you have a misstep in doing it, the question is, have you set up a standard you haven't quite met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| But it isn't written in a way that says you must do A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| It seems to say you ought to be working in these directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| So it's a checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| That's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| I didn't hear from the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| No, I mean I concur because, again, you look at the operative language and it reads can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| That's the permissive may, not the mandatory shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| And coming back, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Well, you know, and this got at a lot of what my issue was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| But I guess my question then is why not just make this an appendix if it's all guidelines and fuzzy shoulds and coulds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3048)|
| 0:50:59| Why make this a separate section, you know, whereas the other two sections, I think, are pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3059)|
| 0:51:07| This, I think, muddies the water a little bit, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| In my mind, making it a section puts it on even footing with everything else that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| It doesn't sound like that's what you want to do with this body of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| And then my issue then is, okay, so in the body now you're saying you've got guidelines that you're asking people to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| So getting to my initial point, well, that caused some misunderstandings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| Okay, there's a guideline, but it's in the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| So it's got to do with what's in the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| It doesn't necessarily have to do with what's in the appendix that's referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| So I guess this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| What I hear you saying, the question I hear you asking is, again, a placement question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| And it is, is this actually a section of, does this carry the weight of section of the document or the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3108)|
| 0:51:58| Or because the house is designed, does it seem better to be added as an appendix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| Because at least in your mind, Mr. McKenzie, you're wondering whether the placement as a section tends to elevate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| in the mind to the other part of the plan where you think it might better fit as an appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| Is that what I hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| I mean, in general, appendices are kind of tools that you can use and reference material that you can go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| to help you through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| And that's what this seems to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| Mark, could you kind of real briefly kind of say why this ended up as a section and not appendices in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| Well, I'll read the first line of the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| It is, implementation through action is an essential element and ultimate goal of every planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| So we wanted to include it within the body of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| And it's written so that it serves as a how to use this plan guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| And through the various action steps, you take the reader from adopting the plan through using the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3175)|
| 0:53:05| and when reviewing amendments to sector plans and land use plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| to using the guidelines for review of rezoning requests and development plans and concept plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3190)|
| 0:53:18| to the last action step is the recommendation for future regulations and requirements through changes to codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| Now, a lot of this is embedded in the body of section two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| but because of the discussion that occurred during the several months of facilitated meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| it became clear that some readers were having trouble figuring out what were policy statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| and what could be interpreted as regulation versus guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| And I wrote this to try to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| And so basically, you come down to what's great about this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| at this point, they're not questioning the usefulness of this tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| And right now, we're just saying, does it best fit within the body or does it best fit as an appendix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| I'm interested just within the group as a whole, or does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| I mean, as far as the group as a whole, does it matter to the group as a whole where it fits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Does anybody like to weigh in on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Thanks, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| I think I like it as a section of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| especially because the fact that it's a section rather than an appendix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3264)|
| 0:54:33| emphasizes that it's a logical step, that we've got action that's going to follow this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| It's not a plan to go on the shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| It's a plan to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| And when you stick something in the appendix, that's a little bit of, you know, that's a reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| It's not like it's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| And I see especially the first four steps is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| if we approve this thing at our next legislative session, I see those first four steps, boom, they're in play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3298)|
| 0:55:07| as soon as the next set of plans come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| And so they're immediately starting to be used, and that's a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| and that's the reason why we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Commissioner McKenzie, do you want to respond to that at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| No, not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| You know, again, I'm just trying to understand how the document flows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| and so I just don't know if we have a setup, Section 1, kind of the meat of the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3334)|
| 0:55:49| in the second section, and this is, I understand they're action steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| but are these mandatory action steps that you want folks to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| And if that answer is yes, then we've kind of muddied everything up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| because, you know, things in here are, you know, guidelines or recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| So I'm just trying to get my arms around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| And that's kind of what I hear you saying, because if we go back to the earlier statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| which is these aren't mandatory, but they're suggested guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| which you talked about earlier, you know, are we going to be held to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| that seems to be what's a little bit confusing there for Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| I guess action step number one, to talk to Sam's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| it does say that adoption of the plan itself immediately, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| supplements or replaces inconsistent parts of the sector plans in the city and county, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3396)|
| 0:56:44| So at least in that step, it's self-effectuating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| As soon as you adopt the plan, you conform the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| but you'd have to conform the sector plans anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| So I'm not sure that that's, you know, anything scary about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| It's just something we're going to have to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| And then the rest of it talks about recommendations for future codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| or ordinances serve to implement the principles and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| And obviously, neither MPC nor any particular legislative county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| or city body can bind a future legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| And I think each legislature is constituted from year to year with different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| So I guess where it's placed doesn't seem to be as troublesome to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| Sam makes the point that it gives it a higher, not visibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| but maybe duty to pay attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| And that's his concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| I understand what he's saying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| And so it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| This is where we come down to, from what I hear, that we find this to be a useful tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| We want that involved, attached to the plan at some level, either as a part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| which Commissioner Norman would say, you know, there's a place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| And it adds some weight to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| And then Commissioner McKenzie, not so much saying it shouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| but he's just trying to understand why it's not an addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| And I think that's where we sit with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| Did you leave the light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| You have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| No, I just wanted to ask Mark a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| You know, the practical question then is, upon adoption, if the legislative bodies approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3494)|
| 0:58:22| how would you use this plan document in January when someone comes to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3502)|
| 0:58:33| I mean, how would it practically be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| What would we do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| The Section 3 would inform the reader how staff would use the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| in making recommendations on land use plan amendments and rezoning cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| And one of the important factors that we considered were the two last paragraphs of Action Step 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3534)|
| 0:59:03| and Action Step 3, which addresses that flexibility issue that you talked about in several of your meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3543)|
| 0:59:13| So we inserted here the statements within the constraints of other elements of the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| and the Farragut-Knox County Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| The legislative bodies may, when warranted by exceptional character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| reasonably deviate from the guidelines of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| So we gave some guidance for how you can be flexible in these step-by-step actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3571)|
| 0:59:44| Any other comments about that before we make some kind of recommendation on how we move forward with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3584)|
| 0:59:51| There's a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| I don't know if that's you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| It's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| This is for clarification, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| But I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| The added Section 3 that we're discussing, was it all drawn from the body of the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| So everything in this is actually already in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| With the exception of those two paragraphs that I just referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| The flexibility paragraphs he added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Yeah, which responds to direct issues that were brought up during this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| You answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| So what I hear at this point, and I'm very hesitant to make recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| but I think we're at the point where maybe one could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| It sounds like what we could do is at this point, if you're comfortable leaving it as a section of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| and then when you move to your legislative bodies for votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| that you could work out whether that moves to another spot or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| That feel comfortable to the chairs that that discussion could take place there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| And I think what that does is we get general agreement on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| It's going to fit in the plan, and within your legislative meetings when you come to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| then if you feel like you want to move that, that could take place at that meeting when you can talk as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| I think essentially, as Mark said, the body of this mainly was drawn from the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| The parts that weren't and that wasn't was basically to emphasize the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| And so I think moving, as you just said, that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| We'll move forward as it is, and then within your legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| you can make that decision if you want to move it to another spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| That would suit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Steve, that's an important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| What Charlie just pointed out, that's an important observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| that basically everything that's in this section has already been covered in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| It's just a repackaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| It's a reaching into the plan, pulling these things out, and emphasizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| They're already there, but now this is how these things, in a logical way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| this is how we're going to try to get these things to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| That's important to make that observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Any other comments on the action plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| I'm going to make one comment over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| I'm sorry, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| You know, it really even gets back to what I was talking about on Appendix I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| and it's the same thing with this, is that, you know, whether you like the plan, don't like the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| or like parts or don't like parts, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| there's always been this whispering out there about what are they trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| this is what they're trying to do, and even if you put Appendix I in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| and you put Section III, we can sit here and argue about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| but I think it takes the veil off of what's hidden or what may or may not be hidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| It sort of puts it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| And I think you then have a lot more to get your handle on about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| It's a lot more concrete about, you know, what the plan is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| Now, you can agree or disagree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| but at least you know what you're agreeing and disagreeing with rather than some vague, hazy things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| And so it may be good to put it out there and then we can argue about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| but at least we know what we're arguing about rather than just against the plan or for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| It's pretty clear about the direction this thing wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| Now, whether you like it or not, you know, we can talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| but it's pretty clear and it doesn't leave a lot to your imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| And that's what I hear Commissioner Briggs say, this is a good thing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| that the work that Councilman De La Volpe has done, the work that the NPC did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| where they gathered what they understood you to say and put it in an action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| this now when you sit down to vote, it's no more of this what does this mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| what is it going to do, and those kind of vague elephant in the room discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| You're saying that kind of lays it out, and now when you have that vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| whether you vote or not, at least you know where you're heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| Is that kind of what I hear you saying with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| I think that's key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| It takes away a lot of the haziness about, you know, this is what you hear from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| What are they trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| What do they really want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| I mean, I think this lays it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| I mean, this is like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Which is an amazing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| It's what we wanted to accomplish when we met back in July for the first time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| I mean, because I think one of the things that we said, and I was even, I told, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| Tony once before is a lot of it is people just don't know what this plan means or what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| You can like it or not like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| This is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Commissioner, Norm, you want to say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| And I hate to give the Chamber any credit for anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| but, you know, you have to give them some credit every once in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| And one thing you can is that they did make their probably some of their argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| and some of their presentation led to this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| And that was probably valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| There was some vagueness there in terms of how this was going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| And we listened to them and we responded to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| That's about as affirming as we're going to get out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| That's outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| And this is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Look up on that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Those are all the sections that we, that language disagreements took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| the questions of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| And so you're looking at, really look at all the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| There's one question, a placement within the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| We put the yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| The reason we did that is that within your legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| you can make that movement of placement, you know, of that document to other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| You're not questioning substantial use of the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| or the application of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| I'm telling you since July 15th, we've worked through a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| And what you've done is the people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| and I'm going to tell you the people in your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| the people who've talked to you, the people who've made suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| even when they were suggestions you didn't like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| and even when they did it in ways that you didn't appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| and all those hours and hours of assumption that took place, you know what has happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| That's all come together with these legislative bodies, and now you have a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| And as Commissioner Briggs said, you may like the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| You may not like the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| But, chairs, I think you're placed now that you can take that document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| and you can go back to your legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| and you can decide whether you want to move forward on that document or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| And I'm excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| I think in terms of how the vote takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| and how you manage that between the bodies of who does what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| that's going to be worked out with the chairs and the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| But unless there is other comments, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| I wonder if Mark could tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| will you give us a clean run so we have one document in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| when we go back to our meetings and vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| we can read it from cover to cover and understand what goes where and not have to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| We are prepared to start cranking that out tomorrow if we get some resolution this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| I think you do have a resolution this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| I just think that's an easier way to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Not have 15 pieces of paper, but one booklet that says what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| I think you can take those changes right there that they've approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| take that to that document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| build a document that you can hand them in one clean document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| and they can take to their bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| Can I make a suggestion maybe, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| And just I really found it helpful the way that the one that the chamber gave us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| because it's got marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| You can see what was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| You can see what's been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| I mean, maybe people like it or not, but it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| You're talking red line basically or red line down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| I mean, I just found it really easy to follow what was there and what's been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| Are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| So you're saying what you'd like to see is the original document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| and then the changes, that document redlined and changes added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| so you see how that document's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| You can see what was taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Like I'm looking on page, what is it, 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| and you can see where 25 was changed to 30 and what was added in and what's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| They have it just crossed through, but you can see what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| It's just these other changes that we were talking about on these other pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| that have been put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| And even Nick's implementation, well, I forget where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| It's the appendix I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| It's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| It's just not labeled as appendix I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| And you can see what's been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| Can you do that for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| We may, in fact, it may be better to provide you two copies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| one a markup and one a clean copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| Some people like me like to deal with clean copies instead of the markups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| I get lost sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| But we can probably do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| We will do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| At the risk of offending our environmental friends, kill a few more trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| and do two copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Are we good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Yes, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Commissioner, right now we're just talking, so that means we'll have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| So the document we have is redlined by the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| Okay, so that's what we had delivered to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| So we'll have one, I guess, redlined by MPC with tonight's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| I don't know what that document will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| And then we'll have just what we think we have codified in the one single document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4150)|
| 1:09:17| And what you have now, you have separately from a private entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| or another entity a copy where they did that work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| And that's for your use and that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| But what you're going to get from MPC is the original that's marked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| and then a clean copy with the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| Yeah, I just want to state the obvious that we'll all be on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| Outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Commissioner, you're live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Well, I just want to say that you guys have done some phenomenal work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| And you've been through a very difficult period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| This was not easy work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| You don't have easy work ahead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| But hopefully since July, Phyllis and I have been some help for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| in moving to a place where you can have a clear understanding of where you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| a clear understanding of where this could go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| and you guys can go to your bodies and make your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| And we're honored that you asked us to be here, and we wish you well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| and we look forward to maybe working with you in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Thanks for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| In regards to the county side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Chairman Hammond has placed the item on the agenda for the 14th workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| and the 21st commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| And so, Mark, if you can get those as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| Are those on for a vote or just as a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| They're not a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| They're on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| What we need from the legislative bodies is a resolution initiating the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| And that will then trigger it going to the planning commission for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| and then back to the legislative body for final consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| So we're not going to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| We're going to vote on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| To initiate the plan as you have developed it here this evening as a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| Okay, so this is the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| It's not a resolution asking you to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| It's the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| The state law requires that it be reviewed by the planning commission before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| This was the option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| Remember, one version was up or down on what they sent us, or this is option two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| We create a document and say, hey, MPC, go study it and tell us if it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| So, Mark, you'll have those by the end of the week, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| Just so I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Tomorrow's the end of the week, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| Just so I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| we're going to be creating a document that gets sent back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| And then does that come back to us again as an up or down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| It will go a vote again from after MPC approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| Yeah, because I think ultimately the one that we get back, we vote up or down without revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| I mean, this process has allowed us to make revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| This will be our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| This is your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| Our plan, but it still has to go back through you to come back to us for a final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| The state law reads that the planning commission may approve, disapprove, or take no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| and you're then allowed to do whatever you want after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| Hey, Mark, tomorrow's the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Is that correct for you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| We'll probably be hand-delivering you a copy on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| I think Monday in the office, I don't want to ask you guys to work on a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| It's not appropriate for us to do that, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| But as quick as you can, Monday would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| Can you e-mail it or is it too large of a document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| It's probably too hefty of a PDF to handle cleanly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| But we can create it and put it on our website for you to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| Send us a link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Yeah, and likewise, I was just going to say, Mr. Donaldson, you might, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| somebody might chime in on this, but I assume the council will move simultaneously on a different schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4383)|
| 1:13:11| And the tricky part becomes whether there's any disagreement on exactly what the final product is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| But I guess we would have a resolution to send that back to the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| and then you would send that back to us, and then we would continue the course and the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| We have already noticed this for your November 29th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4407)|
| 1:13:36| A plan amendment requires a 30-day public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| So we've done that in anticipation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| So that will then put it on the NPC December 8th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| And I know that city council wants to consider it at their December 13th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| Have you noticed the county side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| When did you notice that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| Three weeks ago or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| Councilman Pavlis, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| No, I just want to make sure the 13th, we can hear it then, right, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4445)|
| 1:14:12| The way I understand it, it will have come back from NPC at that point with a recommendation or not, as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| It's your initiated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| As long as it comes back from NPC, you'll be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| And I think he explained it to you, but you need to recognize that this is not like an NPC initiated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4466)|
| 1:14:35| When it comes back to you, you can make changes to it if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| It's not an up or down vote when it comes back to you when it's your initiated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| Now, if you make a change to it that NPC has never looked at before, it will have to go back to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| So you've got to change it within the parameters of what NPC has looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| I just want clarity there just to make sure that this sitting council has the opportunity to deal with this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| because that's the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| And you'll, you know, it will come as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| And ordinances are generally heard on two readings unless you adopt it by emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| So just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop111110?start=4521)|
