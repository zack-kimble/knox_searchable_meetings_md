| 0:04:31| The timing was perfect because we have a city of Knoxville general election right around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=271)|

| 0:05:49| A Diversity Business Enterprise, or DBE, is a small local business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| or one owned by women, minorities, or service-disabled veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| That same day, Thursday, KCDC will cut the ribbon for the third phase of the Five Points Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| We go out there for the ground breakings and we go out there for the ribbon cutting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| and they keep coming, which is really a good sign of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| The ribbon cutting for this 80-unit complex will take place on Thursday, September 26th at 1030 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=374)|
| 0:06:27| at the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue and McConnell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| So 28 buildings, 80 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| Council, I want to thank you all for your commitment to my administration and to KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=395)|
| 0:06:42| and all of our housing partners to really move the needle in providing more units of affordable housing over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| In fact, over the last eight years, the City of Knoxville and our housing partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| have invested more than $236 million in the construction or rehab of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=414)|
| 0:07:03| Our investment of $47.5 million has leveraged spending from other sources totaling more than $189 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| So these investments have resulted in the creation or rehabilitation of over 4,500 units of affordable housing as of September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=431)|
| 0:07:20| Those are really good numbers, but we still have more work to do, and that's something that the city will have to continue to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=440)|
| 0:07:28| Finally, we had previously announced that we were having a meeting on the reconstruction of Fort Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| It was going to be on Monday, September 30th, but there is a conflict with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| so that meeting will not be held on Monday, September 30th, but as soon as we can schedule the date, we will announce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=458)|
| 0:07:47| So the Fort Kidd public meeting will not be Monday the 30th, but we will be rescheduling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| and you should hear something in the next couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| And that is the end of my report. Any reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=479)|

| 0:12:44| as the Randy Tyree Performance Lawn at World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| Move for approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| So, Council, we have our former mayor, Randy Tyree, who is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| If you would please stand and come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| Randy, I want to just remind people just a tad bit about your illustrious career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=778)|
| 0:13:07| Randy was born in Carthage, Tennessee, back in 1940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| You've got a big birthday coming up in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| And he began his career with the city of Knoxville in 1964 as a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| And in 1971, he was appointed safety director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| And then four years later, he was elected mayor in 1975| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| and served two terms through 1983.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| So if you think back, that was during the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| when the city was planning for the 1982 World's Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| also known as the Knoxville International Energy Exposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| So Randy had the challenge of working with the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| and with all the public in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| trying to lead the planning and building support for having World's Fair here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| And then, during the six-month event in 1982, he presided over that event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| welcoming some 11 million visitors from around the globe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| So as we made the improvements to the World's Fair performance lawn earlier this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| it really struck us that this would be a nice way to recognize Mayor Tyree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| and the leadership that he showed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| which has now resulted not only in a really successful World's Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| but this unbelievably huge asset, the World's Fair Park, in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| So that is why we took this recommendation to the Public Property Naming Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| and they supported it recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Thank you, Chair Ryder, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| And it's why we're recommending this to council today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| And let me hear from Councilwoman McKenzie first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| And so, Mayor Tyree, you knew that I would not let this opportunity go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| without sharing a little bit about your relationship with my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| And to everyone that is not aware, Mayor Tyree actually was one of the first people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| that my family and my dad met when we first moved to Knoxville in 1969.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| And those were some very turbulent times for civil rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| And I remember you always being there, and I've read articles and information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| and heard stories from my mother about how you stood on the front lines with my dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| more times than not when there were issues in the black community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| to actually help to calm the situations and to find peaceful resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| And for that, I just want to thank you, not only for your friendship to my dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| but also for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| And so thank you so much for all that you've done and what you continue to do for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Mayor Tyree, you're probably more comfortable on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| At this stage of my life, I'm comfortable wherever I've been able to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you all is number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| I will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| I know that's going to surprise some of you that I can be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| But two items that I want to talk with you about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| Number one is the fact that from the standpoint of this commitment on the name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=979)|
| 0:16:35| is if there was a way to divide up the issue into millions of pieces of credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=995)|
| 0:16:46| that goes to those individuals that help make the world's fair success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| then I would want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| I am honored by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| I did not anticipate that the labor of love over the years would result in doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1017)|
| 0:17:06| but I am deeply appreciative of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Now, the second thing is not quite as a monumental event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| but I wanted to share with you an event that stems from the fact that we had this naming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1036)|
| 0:17:26| I was pretty excited about it, so I got in my vehicle and I drove over on the World's Fair site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| and was wanting to just be there and bask in the glow of the naming of this process, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1055)|
| 0:17:45| So I pulled into and parked in one of the gate entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1065)|
| 0:17:54| I cranked up Willie Nelson, and he was singing my favorite song,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| Lord, it's hard to be humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| As a result of that, I was indeed basking in what was to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| About that time, there was a young man, I'd say in his mid-20s, that approached my vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1091)|
| 0:18:20| and he said, Sir, you can't park here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| The first thought in my mind, well, he doesn't know who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| At that point, I thought, shut up, Tyree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| Just listen and work your way through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| So what occurred, he was, as I mentioned, very polite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| As I started thinking about, now, this is a great chance for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| to be able to give a real history lesson here to people in public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| So I proceeded to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| As a matter of fact, it probably had more to do with my wanting to brag about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1142)|
| 0:19:13| all the accomplishments and the unity that we had for the World's Fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| than it was really an educational process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| But I went ahead, gave him, and I highlighted those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| In 1975, the election still holds the record, I told you, of voter turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1167)|
| 0:19:34| There was over 50,000 people voted in that runoff in 1975.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| I also mentioned the fact that it was a close race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1180)|
| 0:19:50| As a matter of fact, my margin of victory was 7 one-thousandths of a percentage point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| That turned out to be 007, which I thought was pretty cool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| since I'd been in police work for those 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| So what occurred at that point is I could tell that he was listening intently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1206)|
| 0:20:17| So when I got to the part about the scruffy little city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| and then the Wall Street Journal calling us that, he was giving me this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| and I thought, this is going to be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| I paused to take a breath, which he was waiting on, apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| because he said, sir, that's interesting, but you still cannot park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| That was my adventure of the day on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Folks, let me tell you, I don't have to tell you all anything about what kind of community we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1251)|
| 0:21:01| because you all have demonstrated your servant's hearts that you have available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| If anyone wants to ever challenge, as a matter of fact, they can't challenge the grit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1267)|
| 0:21:18| and the commitment that we showed as a community because that word, unity, is a powerful word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1278)|
| 0:21:27| whether it's in the scriptures, whether it's in the family, whether it's in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| We had unity, and as a direct result of that, we put on a show for the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1293)|
| 0:21:41| that has been second to none in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| I thank you all, and perhaps I should have wished you had had a vote before I spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| Love you all. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1316)|
| 0:22:14| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| I'm afraid they probably still won't let you park there, though, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| 11B is the resolution expressing concern about the policy of allowing gun shows to be conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| within city facilities and respectfully requesting that gun shows no longer be conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| in facilities owned and operated by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| Mayor, I'm going to move to approve, but before we vote, could I make a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| Yes, and we have several people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Would you like to go ahead and speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| I would like to go ahead, and so I just want to speak briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| just to ensure that there is no confusion as to what the intent of this resolution is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| This resolution is not a statement or an indictment, from my perspective, against legal gun ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| so I really want to make sure that that's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| What this resolution is, however, it is a statement against gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| It is a statement toward a community within this city who historically has been plagued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| with higher crime rates and higher gun violence rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| And so in putting this resolution together, I probably was a little remiss to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| that everyone would fully understand it or even get it or support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| because it's very hard to understand it if you've never lived in a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| or had neighborhoods where gun violence is prevalent, where hearing gunshots is prevalent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1431)|
| 0:24:01| and having to go to funerals of young people is prevalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1441)|
| 0:24:09| And so I have been fortunate and blessed, like a lot of other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| to not have to experience a lot of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| Some of those have hit home for me as well, because I have lost a family member to gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| And so for a community who has had to endure a lot of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| and then to add insult to injury along the way because of the statistics, be labeled a gun zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1470)|
| 0:24:39| And to have gun shows in the middle of a community that has been labeled a gun zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| was never welcomed in that community and never wanted in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| And there have been many, many other people who came before me who spoke out against that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| and actually stood and protested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| And I'd like to ask if you're in this room and you have ever protested and stood in the cold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| and I know there's a young man here who has stood in the cold long before I did in protest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| would you please stand very quickly if you're here and you have stood out in the cold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| in protest to the gun shows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| And so with that said, this resolution is stating that the gun shows, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| as a safety measure is not welcomed in the community of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| As we see the rise in hate crimes and mass shootings across our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| we have been very fortunate in the city of Knoxville that we have not been plagued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| with seeing a lot of those things, especially mass shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| But as I will always remind people, we are only one incident away from having that evil enigma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| of hatred in the histories of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| And while there are some people who I think get acutely immune to gun violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| because they have not been impacted by it and they don't have to live in communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| that are impacted by it, I don't want to live in a city where my grandchildren grow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| and that's the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Mass shootings and gun violence is the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| And so today I want to commend the East Knoxville community specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| because the gun violence and crime statistics continue to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| because as a community people have stopped being afraid to stand up and to speak out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| and to let their voices be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| And so for that community where we have gun shows, this community, let me say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| the 6th District where gun shows are held, they are in close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| and in some cases walking distance to schools and to churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| where we have seen across the country where mass shootings have been prevalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| And so for this and many other reasons I am very pleased to bring forth this resolution today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| to let people know that these gun shows are not welcome in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| and that we stand together in unity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| And to the folks who do not live in that community and have never experienced those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| I thank you for standing up for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Oh, I'm sorry, you didn't want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Is that somebody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| All right, we have three people signed up to speak, Vivian Scheidt, Sam Brown, and Mary Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| So we'll go in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you for being here, Ms. Scheidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| And as you know, we've got the timer up there to keep an eye on the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| Vivian Scheidt, 3615 Martin Luther King Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1670)|
| 0:27:58| I'll be brief, straight to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| I've come to ask you all to be bold and do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| Only our children do what they see us do, not what we tell them, not what we say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| And what they're seeing is that we're allowing guns in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| And so our actions are making our words a lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| We need to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| We are building up East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Magnolia is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Burlington area, the design center is designing things for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| We are doing what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Take the gun shows to another place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| We want them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Next is Sam Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you, Mr. Brown, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Samuel Brown, 4401 Norwalk Avenue, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1737)|
| 0:29:08| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I thank all of you for this opportunity to speak to this serious matter tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| I seek to appeal primarily not to your logic or reason, but to your conscience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1755)|
| 0:29:23| and the part of our psyche that leads our moral behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| Frankly, I have come to know and admire many of you seated on this dais this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| and I trust and believe that you will make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| I will pose the question, how many more young people must senselessly lose their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1781)|
| 0:29:50| to handgun violence before government at all levels does whatever it can to send the message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1790)|
| 0:30:01| to the rest of society and to set the example for posterity that when we had a crisis on our hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| those of us elected and given the power to make a change did just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| I trust tonight that you will make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| I myself am someone who grew up in the 6th District on the 2400 block of Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1820)|
| 0:30:29| My first year as a freshman at Austin East High School, there was a senior that was set to graduate that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| Sadly, after we celebrated winning the state championship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| he returned to learn that he had died as a result of handgun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| Countless others of classmates, friends, family members, even persons connected to the congregation I now pastor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1846)|
| 0:30:55| the Logan Temple AME Zion Church, have all been affected in one way or another by the travesty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| the preventable cause of death that is handgun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| So in appealing to your conscience tonight, I hope it will then lead you into the realm of reason and logic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| and you will vote to no longer host these gun shows at city-owned facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you, Pastor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Ms. Mary Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1885)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you for being here, Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| If you could pull that mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| You can keep an eye on the time up above my head here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| I'm Mary Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| I live at 5208 Cayuga Drive in Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1913)|
| 0:32:03| My discussion is a little personal and a little public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| Most of you all don't know my history or my family's history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| but in 1987, my four adult children and I were survivors of a shooting that killed two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1936)|
| 0:32:30| Then we moved down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| Two of my four children went to East Tennessee State, and one son stayed in West Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1954)|
| 0:32:43| He is now down here with me because he's developed problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| But I also want to talk about our neighborhood and our situation with guns and gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1970)|
| 0:33:01| I attend a church on MLK Avenue, Payne Avenue, Missionary Baptist, and I have a church family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1981)|
| 0:33:12| One of the members of the church family is a young lady who was accidentally shot at a birthday party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=1992)|
| 0:33:22| three and a half years ago over in Mechanicsville, and she happened to be pregnant at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2002)|
| 0:33:30| But thank God, she became paralyzed from the gunshot, but the baby was born just fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2010)|
| 0:33:43| and he's now a feisty little three-year-old boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| She is working really hard with doctors to learn how to walk again, which God is blessing her about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2027)|
| 0:33:56| We hear gunshots a lot in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| There's also a lady whose son goes to our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| He was shot in gang violence about three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| and they honored his memory last week with balloons that they shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| But there's not a whole lot of encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| When you suffer these kinds of tragedies, it's really hard to get over or outlive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2060)|
| 0:34:29| You always have that in your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| So my feeling about these gunshows is that they should never be made to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2072)|
| 0:34:42| or be allowed, really, to sell guns in our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| because there's so many loopholes that even kids who aren't 21 can figure out a way to buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2087)|
| 0:34:56| So I just hope and encourage you all to do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| and pass my dear friend Gwen McKenzie's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| I also want to recognize, I know there are several members here from Moms Demand Action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| and also from the faith community, Terry Walker-Smith, as well as Ms. Sonobia Dobson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| I see that you all are here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| And also I want to ask, Mayor, indulge me just one more moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| I'd like to ask Pastor Lawrence Washington, I know he did not get a chance to sign up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| if he'd like to come and make a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| because this young man actually was protesting the gunshows for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| And I know that there were some days where he was the only person that showed up out there in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| in the cold when it was snowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| And so if he would like to come down and make a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| I know that he works closely with, still working closely with KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| and also with our young people to actually help get them out of gangs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| and to help keep them out of gangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| And so he's doing a lot of good work, and I just want to recognize his efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| and his partnership along with others that I named in protesting the gunshows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| and helping to get us to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| So if you'd like to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Please state your name and address for the record first, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Lawrence Williams, 2061 Bethel Avenue, Apartment 128.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| And we, back in, a few years back, me and a couple of friends of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2192)|
| 0:36:41| Joan Conwell, James Mathis, we started doing a protest, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| protesting the gun show over at Chihuly Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Because like Ms. McKinney said, it doesn't make sense for you to have a gun zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| I mean a gun show in a gun zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| And every night we deal with the gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| See, people come in our community, sell guns and whatnot, you know, go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| But we've got to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| We've got to deal with it on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| And I meet with certain people, some of y'all up here in my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| and I often tell folks, you know, when I come for you asking for help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| and you say and you tell me no, you ain't telling me no, you telling them young men no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| Them young men that's affected by this gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| People that's out there, you know, in this stuff, you know, in the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| And these young men is asking, you know, they seeking a way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| But the thing is, we ain't answering the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| A lot of folks ain't answering the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| We have a program called the Safe Haven Program where we work with young men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2272)|
| 0:38:01| game members and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| What we do is we bring them in where they can play basketball together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| But we use it, we organize it as a game setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| They come in, they have life skills and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| We was in partnership with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| And during that time we didn't have no, wasn't no game violence during that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| And the thing is that what we have to do is we got to ask them, you know, what do they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| We need to start listening to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| And that's one thing that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| I hit these streets at night, you know, and I'm going to watch what I say because sometimes I say things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2313)|
| 0:38:41| and I get in trouble for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| But I'm passionate, you know, because that's where I come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| That's where I come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| And when we have the gun shows inside the gun zone, inside the East Knoxville, like she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| you know, that's not a good look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Bring jobs over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| You know, business over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Everything is leaving now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| But ain't nothing, ain't no resources, you know, coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| And so these boys, these young men, you know, out there, you know, trying to provide for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| Now, yeah, you can say that, well, you know, they got choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| They have choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| But you don't know what's going on behind the scenes, behind the scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| And that's where me and a couple of other folks, we go to their homes, we talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2371)|
| 0:39:39| And, you know, you got a lot of good organizations out here that's really trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| But they ain't got the backing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Don't have the backing, don't have the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| And it's sad to say that the same groups, the same people continue to get the resources and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2389)|
| 0:39:57| And, you know, we call them pillars in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| But, you know, I want to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| Is this, that are you making a difference in a person's life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| Are you making a difference in a person's life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Are you trying to stop this violence or are you just turning your head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| And see, that's what we get a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| People is turning their head, you know, turning their back on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| And say, you know what they tell me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Oh, you know, you can't do nothing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| You can't stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| Maybe I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| But one thing I'm going to continue to do is try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And I'm going to continue to fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| And I'm going to continue to stand against this gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| And if y'all don't pass that bill, we'll be out there protesting the gun show at Chihuly Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| Because the thing about it is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| I mean, at some point in time, you know, we got to wake up and do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| We have to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Yeah, y'all go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Y'all go home at night and sleep well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| But guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| We heard all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| And my phone constantly ringing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Young lady told me the other day, she said, man, they killed my son in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| In front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| I ain't got no answers to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| The only thing I can do is just listen to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| And try to get with them boys where they won't go do no revenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| But it takes, you know, I mean, I'm just, you know, it just bothers me, man, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| It's just a sad thing, you know, what we deal with, what we got to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| And the thing is, you know, like my brother said, let's just do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| Let's just do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| That's all I got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2513)|
| 0:42:03| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| I want to commend Councilwoman McKenzie, my colleague, for bringing this forward, this issue forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| I think this is a step in the correct direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| But it's not going to solve all the problems that have been displayed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| They are deep and long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| I would like to ask our attorney, Rob Frost, to give us a little more depth in what we're actually doing here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2543)|
| 0:42:32| Thank you, Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| As Council knows, this is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| This is a resolution, assuming that it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| If it passes, it expresses the opinion of Council in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| It is not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| It does not carry the weight of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| I'm sure the administration will take into account the desire of Council if the administration decides to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| in crafting a policy about this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| And let me speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| I have publicly stated that I support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| I appreciate Councilwoman McKenzie and the others bringing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| Publicly, you should know, though, we have two existing dates that are already contracted at Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2598)|
| 0:43:27| The gun shows will go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| There's one on November 30th and December 1st, another one on December 28th and 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| There's also one in October, but that's at the Expo Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| So at the end of November and the end of December, there will still be those two shows because they have been previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| there's a contractual obligation already with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| And then at that point, after December 21st, I will no longer be mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| So it's up to whoever assumes this office on November 5th who gets elected and takes office on December 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2634)|
| 0:44:03| That will be their decision on whether or not to follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| But it would be my recommendation to them to follow the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| One thing we will do is not to accept any other requests in the meantime if those were to come to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| but just to fill out the two that are already contractually obligated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| I also want to commend my colleague, Councilperson McKenzie, for bringing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| Thank you very much for bringing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| I'm very glad to be sponsoring it as well, and I'm looking forward to voting for it here in a few moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| And I just want to echo some of what you had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| You know, gun ownership is a constitutionally protected right under the Second Amendment, which I support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| and I believe everyone up here does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| I believe the intent of this resolution is asking the administration to consider there are certain sensitive places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| where firearms aren't appropriate on our public properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| It's hard to imagine that gun shows adjacent to schools or a children's museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| or other family-friendly attractions is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| We've also talked about community and churches as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| These are sensitive to the open display of firearms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| and such events could detract from the interest and the investment our city has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| in promoting certain family-centered attractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| As there are many other available facilities to host gun shows on private property across our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| a discussion on where it is appropriate for gun shows to be held on our city's public property is appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2734)|
| 0:45:42| So I will support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| My only concern about this is whether the city actually has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| to regulate and prohibit gun sales on public property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| and I'm certainly no lawyer and not esteemed in what the law is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| but what I have concern, and I think as this moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| that that will be given great consideration not to put the taxpayers or the city at harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| for something that they can't control if they deem they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| So that's really only my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| I hear the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| I hear the gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| I understand that, but I think it's really we've got to decide whether it's really clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| whether state law permits a city or any municipality to regulate firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| So that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| So, Mayor, I just want to, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| be very clear that I was not aware of the gun shows that was already scheduled in November and December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| so I may have lost sight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| But thank you very much for bringing that to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| because that would have been of great shock to all of us, including myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| after expressing this concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| So I just wanted to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Okay, this passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2835)|
| 0:47:26| We'll move on to 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| 11C is a resolution respectfully requesting the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| to consider and make a recommendation to city council regarding limited revisions to the city sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| I'm sorry, there's somebody wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Margo Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Sorry, Margo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I had your name here and almost skipped over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Margo Kline, 1400 Kennesaw Avenue, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| I don't really have much to say except that I'm here on behalf of Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| and that we support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| And Mayor, I had a few things I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| First, I want to apologize to my colleagues for not getting this resolution out faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| because we would normally have shopped it around and seen if there were any co-sponsors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| but time was of the essence, so we kind of, the clock got to us, so I had to get it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| I wanted to talk briefly about the intent here before we vote on it, and I imagine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| Director Greene is in here somewhere, I thought I saw him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| Well, this resolution is asking for Knoxville-Knox County Planning to study and make specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| recommendations to council regarding specific parts of the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| The first part is on regulation for all uses in the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| This is a newly created district, the institutional district, which had not been really incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| into the sign regulations, so comment and recommendations are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| The second is on additional signs in commercial and industrial districts, specifically if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| extra signs should be approved through the variance process or through Knoxville-Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| County Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| I always want to say NPC, but that's their new name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| So I'll make sure that this is transmitted to Director Greene so he can bring it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| and we do want this to end up on the November agenda, so that these recommendations can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| come back to council before the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| We have a motion and a second, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| 11D is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville authorizing the mayor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| execute an amendment to the purchase and sale agreement with Metro Knoxville KMALLC for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| the acquisition of an additional 1.7 acres of real property located at the future site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| of the public safety complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Yeah, I wanted to ask Mr. Brace if he, or I thought I had seen him, maybe he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| He's not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| His daughter had a ballet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| I thought I saw him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| We encouraged him to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| So I didn't see him at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| I envisioned him here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| That's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Well, I don't know if Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Masking is David Brace is Dr. Lyons, so if you have a question, perhaps he'll be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Like a shape shifter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| So, anyway, does this in any way change the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| Does it factor into the current plans that have been presented to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Those are kind of my questions about that particular addition to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| No, it doesn't change those plans at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| This is just a property that became available to us that the city could include in the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| that would allow, or in the conveyance, which would allow us to have more control over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| property, but it doesn't in any way affect the plans that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| So there is no plan at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| That is something that will be determined in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| It's an up in the air as what the future use of it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| It could also potentially be resold, redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| It's in the redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| All of that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| This provides opportunity in the future and just gives us valuable control over another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| piece of land and many options that future mayors and councils can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| The caption here says Metro Knoxville KMA, it's actually Metro Knoxville HMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| HMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Does that need to be in the caption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| The caption on our agenda says KMA, and in fact, that's what Mr. Johnson read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3125)|
| 0:52:15| Well, as long as we've spotted it before you vote, why don't we go ahead and amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| Why don't you make a motion to amend that to HMA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| Well, actually, on the agenda information sheet, it's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| Yeah, but on our sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| We want the ordinance to be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| I mean, the resolution to be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Well, then let's amend that to be Metro Knoxville HMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Good catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Let's go ahead and vote on that because I don't think that's what you're going to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| I'm just on the amendment to clarify it's HMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| And Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| Mr. Lyons, Bryce and I exchanged a couple emails today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| It's like a really valuable piece of property that we're getting for no additional concessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| So, my only question was, does it come with any restrictions to be able to sell it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| the future should it not be needed by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| I believe it does not contain such restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| If I'm wrong, Mr. Mametoff was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| He can correct me, but I believe it's without restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Without restrictions, but it is subject to a lease, and so it will be subject to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| lease agreement, and it's a reasonably long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| I think a 20-some year lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Is it a land lease or is it a tenant lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| I mean, what are we buying there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Or what are we getting that we're going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| I didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Go ahead, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Mark Mametoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| This piece of property, as I think you know, is on the one facing Woodland across from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| Jackie's Dream, and it's the old ambulatory care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| What was done was they basically did a sale-lease back of that facility, so it's a very, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| long-term ground lease to a REIT called Lillibridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| It's not the legal name of it, but it's affiliated with it, and they're leasing it back to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| used to be a for-profit subsidiary of St. Mary's called Health Dynamics, and so all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| we're really getting is the ground underneath and a $10,000 a year income stream for a long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3261)|
| 0:54:29| long time, but it gives us a seat at the table, basically, to be able to have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| to redevelop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| The Health Dynamics lease is up really soon, so basically they're paying a big chunk of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| money to Lillibridge, but that income stream is going to end in three years, and so Lillibridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| is going to be stuck with an empty building, and so they will have every incentive at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| point to work with us to try to redevelop the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| They're not going to just walk away from it, obviously, but we, as the fee owner, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| have the opportunity to be able to be there, but it's your very typical ground lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| with just a regular income stream, but really no liabilities on our part to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| It's also half of a tax parcel, so what we started realizing is that we'd have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| them to subdivide the parcels to be able to convey it to us and comply with the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| laws, and it really made more sense to go ahead and just convey us all the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| Does the parking lot go with the other half of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| Part of it, there's an easement for some parking area for this building that goes on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| other half of it, but a lot of it's just undeveloped and things, but yes, there is some parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| So how much longer is the ambulatory clinic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| How much longer is their lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Well, the ambulatory clinic is over in 2021, but the ground lease to Lillit Bridge is 2049| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| with another 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| I'll be deep under by the time it's over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| Well, that's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| That's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Again, it's the sort of thing you try to negotiate a termination of at some point if we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| No guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Mr. Manitow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| To clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| So they're not currently operating there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| It's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| It's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| It's totally vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| I drive by there constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| I think it's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| It looks it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| They must be invisible cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| They're riding the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| There's no one coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| So the ground is owned by HMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Which is what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Not HMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| HMA owns the underneath and ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| They've got a very long-term ground lease to this Lilla Bridge entity that goes on at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| least until 2049.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| Then Lilla Bridge is turned around and leased the building and everything to Health Dynamics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| and it ends at least right now in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| And so we would expect them not to renew the 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| They have options to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| They have an option to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| But because given-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| But they've already vacated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| Given they're already vacated, I doubt they'll renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| So it wouldn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| So at that point, Lilla Bridge has lost its tenant and obviously it's still a valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| building, but at that point in time-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| So we would be at the table to renegotiate their long-term lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| And I never really answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| I've looked hard for restrictions, but we don't have the title work back, so I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| have every single encumbrance on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| But the ground lease and any of the documents we have do not restrict the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| In other words, if we decide we don't want this property, we could subdivide it and sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| it at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| But we would have control of all the parcels-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| In that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| So that we wouldn't have to go through the subdivision and it would make it easier to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| We didn't see much of a downside in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Also, I should mention that we're also extending the due diligence period 15 days to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| up the title work on this part and also to try to continue to resolve some easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| on the buildings there in terms of some of the wireless-type stuff that HMA is working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| hard to get resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| So that's also part of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| And so for the record, what is the end of the new date for the end of the due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| The end of the due diligence will be October 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| We didn't push back the closing date, though, because we want to get that done this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| And so the closing date didn't change, but we needed a little bit more time when we added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| this property to do that and also to get these other issues resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| And for those of you who don't know, I'm actually just- I'm special counsel to the city, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=3511)|

| 1:09:59| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| Director Foster, we spoke about this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| I was wondering if you'd just give a brief explanation of the understanding about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| and the jobs and the money involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| This is, if you recall, it's a former Ameristill plant, Griddle Ameristill plant purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| by CMC Steel back in November 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| Right now they're producing long steel manufacturing for non-construction products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| Right now they're planning to invest over a period of maybe five years, five to six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| million dollars more annually over those for new projects for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| So pretty much this pilot, the five-year pilot is for more like an economic job development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| retention recruitment and expansion tool for the CMC Steel site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| We do have Mr. Miller with Director of Operations, if you want to speak further about that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| that's what the pilot is primarily for, for the expansions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| They're looking for about 10 to 12 different projects on this site and this pilot will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| help to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Let's hear from Mr. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| That's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Mr. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| Put him on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| I just, yeah, let's hear what you're, I'd love to hear what your plans are and, uh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4274)|
| 1:11:22| Okay, we, um, CMC is a recycler of steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| We bring in scrap steel and recycle it into rebar that's used all over Tennessee and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| over the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| In this situation, we're going to, over the next five years, we're going to spend 25 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| 30 million dollars to sustain what we have going with our equipment and also to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| improvements to improve efficiency, to improve the quality of our product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| Next year, we plan to upgrade some rolling mill cranes and modernize some switch gear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| The following year, we'll be doing some things to improve the efficiency of our reheat furnace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| The next year after that, we're going to be going into looking into some building technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| and possibly a ladle furnace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| So over the next five years, we have a pretty robust plan on how to sustain what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| as far as volume for employees and hopefully grow to a higher level, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| We have 237 employees now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| We have good-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| We're about $26 an hour on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| And so, uh, and it doesn't stop there, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| Since we recycle steel, we bring in scrap, and so we bring in probably 50 to 60 trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| of scrap a day, and we also put out 50 to 60 trucks of finished rebar a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| So we're supporting trucking across the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| We're supporting scrap facilities around northeast Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| We're supplying machine shops that do our work for us, and we have many contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| working on-site also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| So it really doesn't stop just at our 237 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| Some people say there's a factor of about 7 to 1 in a steel mill like this on how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| jobs it does provide around the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| I also want to give a shout-out and thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| I think it was a few years ago when, it was a different name then, I think, Gerdau, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| you all were involved with us in building the playground for the kids of Lonsdale Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| in honor of Xavier Ondopson, and I know you all deeded some of your land over for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| field, and we appreciate you working with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| So we, uh, Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Mr. Miller, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| You were about to take a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| I just had a quick question for you in follow-up to your comments about the number of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| at the site right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| Are you envisioning that will be retained or expanded through some of these improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| From what we've looked at so far, we think about 9 to 10 employees, but that could definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| grow as opportunities come our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| It's a pretty competitive industry, so we really have to stay ahead of things, but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| we can stay ahead of the competition, we could grow more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4458)|

| 1:14:20| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Um, before we go to public forum, are there, well, I believe that we have, um, a Boy Scout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| over there that we could recognize for sitting through our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| You'd like to stand up, and we usually acknowledge the Scouts that come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| And I can't see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Thank you so much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Is this for one of your badges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4481)|

| 1:14:46| Well, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| So we are now at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| We have three people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| First is Constance Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Constance Every, if you would please come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Being here, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Are we in public forum already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Yep, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| My name is Constance Every, 301 North Charlie Drive, Nassau, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| So today, Mrs. McKenzie brought forth a bill that I agree with Mr. Sanders, is a step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| a step toward addressing the bigger issue, the bigger problem, which is the gun violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| and the death rate that we are having in certain communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| However, as I sit here and listen to different things that we've talked about today on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| agenda, and I look at the amount of money being spent, I realize that Knoxville still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| has many, many unsolved issues, and gun violence is one of the many on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| Madeline Roher sat here herself and just said that we have 4,500 available housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| or built units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| I'm not sure exactly how you put it in that language, but 4,500 are numbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| So the housing today in Knoxville as we speak is 10,000 homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| So if you do 45, yeah, check the facts, it's done by the University of Tennessee on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| They have an organization that does the homeless evaluation numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| They just dropped their numbers of June this year, 10,000 was the count that they turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| in, 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| So if you have 4,500 units and you times that 4,500 by three, that's like 13,000 plus people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| been housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| So the question is, where are these 4,500 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| If we do have them, why we got 10,000 homeless people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| In addition to the fact, we've been talking about resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| The last time this council met, they put in a resolution for the body count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Okay, we're going to be real about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| That was crap policy and really an insult to intelligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| Because if you think that the public of us who look at that resolution really believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| that that's going to be the solution of body cameras and that we're going to accept that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| as a policy groundwork, then y'all fooled yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| You just sat here and spent $136,000 in an evaluation, a study, not actually doing anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4619)|
| 1:17:07| just somebody's going to go out there and mark some numbers and put some documents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| statistics together to say this is or isn't happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| Meanwhile, we are still going without body cameras on our police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| Why are you spending $136,000 on a survey study instead of body cameras?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| See this is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| Y'all have a priority problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| Prioritizing issues is a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| Just this month alone, we had seven incidents of misconduct amongst our police departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4651)|
| 1:17:38| and our local politicians, particularly Larson Jay was the last one who just made a fool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| of himself by taking $4,200 of taxpayers' money in an ABN conference retreat for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Very questionable behind all of that, how that took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| So I say this to say that Knoxville has to do better, period, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| We have too many problems here for people to be wasting money and playing games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| You sat here and said that you could not move the gun shows from where they're currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| at for the next two meetups because of contractual issues, but I call that a lie too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| Because if something was wrong on that property, like let's say something got damaged or destroyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| or broken where the city was going to have to do a repair and it would intervene with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| the gun show's capability, you all would easily move that location to somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| and schedule it for that other location due to or deemed to an issue of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| So why not do the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| Contracts don't always hold everything because there's always clauses put there for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Meaning if something happens and we might have to break the contract, we put a clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| in there to protect ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| You've got a whole attorney up here that does just this particular job and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| So there's no excuse for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| So at the end of the day, for me, it still stands the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| We have 20 plus unsolved murders in just this year alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| If you date back to 2001, I bet it's over 100 plus unsolved murders alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| So the question still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| How are we going to effectively address gun violence and gun issues if we're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| to address accountability factors, people not doing the right thing, corruption, lying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| filling up taxpayers' funding, all these factors that we have going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| You're not making an inch to anything until you start addressing root cause of root problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| So that's why the DOJ complaint will continue to go forward and we are requesting oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| into the corruption of our police departments and our local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| I don't care who gets caught and who gets brought down with it because if you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| the wrong thing, you deserve to fall with everybody who gets caught anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| So the same answer still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| We have election coming up, October the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| We have November the 4th, I'm sorry, November the 5th, which is our primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| Continue to vote, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Continue to vote for these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Continue to hold these people accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Continue to request that they do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| Thank you, Ms. Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| Now Robert Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| Robert Lee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| He phoned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| Is Mr. Lee here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| Okay, we'll go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Sherry Raymond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Is Sherry Raymond here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Thank you, Ms. Raymond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| Please state your name and address for the record and you can see the timer above my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4814)|
| 1:20:28| head here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Sherry Raymond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| I live at 332 Forest All Drive, zip code 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| I came here to speak about one subject, but after listening to Constance, I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4835)|
| 1:20:41| to say that I too am very disappointed in the lack of progress on body cameras for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4841)|
| 1:20:48| KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| I went to the very first park meeting after Thomas became police chief and she assured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| us then that that was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| The sheriff's department has had body cameras for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| They are in use in law enforcement departments all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| There is no excuse to be studying their feasibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| You should be taking bids and putting them on the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| Okay, now to the subject I really want to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| I went to a public meeting last night about the volunteer ministry project at Castle Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| over on 5th Avenue and I'm not sure what the status of this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| It sounds interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Of course, volunteer ministry wants to help end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| Castle Park, it's kind of an interesting situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| On 5th Avenue there, starting in the 37917 zip code, you have the CAT bus terminal, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4899)|
| 1:21:47| maintenance terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| Then you have the YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Then you have the O'Connor Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| Now if you turn down Winona, right behind that, there is a lovely large public park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| with playground equipment, walking trails, a covered picnic table area in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4920)|
| 1:22:07| Come back up to 5th Avenue and go across Winona, then you have the Knox Urban League building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4927)|
| 1:22:15| Across from that you have a positively living apartment complex that's already in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| Volunteer ministry is talking about taking that over as part of this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| On the other side, continuing on out away from town, on the other side of the positively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| living apartment complex, you have the ball fields which are 90% of the time or more locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4953)|
| 1:22:41| According to Park Ridge residents, they are not available for public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| The lots that volunteer ministry is interested in are along the sidewalk along 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4966)|
| 1:22:54| It's a very narrow strip of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| It's considered open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| I believe the zoning is OS2, which deals with parks and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| I have a hard time defending ball fields as the kind of park that I am passionate about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4985)|
| 1:23:12| that has urban wilderness and has a place for people to play and gather and is open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| to the public during regular hours, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=4998)|
| 1:23:26| We need to look at the suitability of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| As Constance mentioned, there is a huge homeless need here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| I have heard that there are several hundred people who are currently ready to enter into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| a permanent housing agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| Volunteer ministry is planning on putting 47 apartments in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5022)|
| 1:23:49| I'm not sure how that's going to make a dent when there's 10 to 15 times that many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| They want the city to give them that land, presumably so the city doesn't have to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| to mow it, but they're going to continue to pay to maintain these ball fields that get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| relatively little use, especially not by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| Those are labor-intensive, fertilizer-intensive, even pesticide-intensive sites to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5051)|
| 1:24:19| They say that the Park Ridge location, the Fifth Avenue location, is good because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| on a bus route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| Well, it is, but it's a neighborhood bus route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| That means it's a small bus, and I have ridden that route over to the Senior Center many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| It's usually pretty full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| So adding four dozen more people that are going to be wanting to ride that route that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| only runs once an hour is not exactly a great option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| They would have to walk the extra block over to Magnolia to have access to really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| And back to the positively living situation, volunteer ministry assures the public that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| they have certain requirements, that they don't grant housing to people who are on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| state meth wash list or who are on the sex offenders registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| I don't have a problem with that, but there's a question of whether some of the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| are already housed in positively living might not meet their qualifications, and you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| solve homelessness by making other people homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| Okay, Council, there is no more business, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190924?start=5133)|
