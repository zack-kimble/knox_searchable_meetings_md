| 0:15:06| that you have with your permit. Commissioner Shouts. Thank you. This is the same, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| as West Knoxville and over here in the square? I mean the same company? Yes, sir. South end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| of the market square and you have one deep west somewhere, don't you? We have one over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| off of North Shore, behind the Publix. Okay. There are very nice establishments and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| made some inspections there. We have one in Fountain City, North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=929)|
| 0:15:37| and downtown. We have a motion and a second with the pendings. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| Any opposed? The ayes have it. Copper Cellar Catering, Knoxville Harley Davidson West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| LLC, 605 Lovell Road, on premises, special event, District 6. Could you give your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| and address for the record, please, ma'am? Yes, my name is Heather Ferguson. I am an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| attorney representing Copper Cellar Corporation and my address is 5154 Garden Meadow Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912. All right. I'm trying to see how to handle this one since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=967)|
| 0:16:23| you are not really the person before this board. Yes, I was on this point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| I think someone representing the corporation needs to be here and all of our other. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| she is the legal representative of the. She's the agent. I'm just trying to figure out how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| to rephrase my questions that will actually apply. She can represent them in certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1001)|
| 0:16:49| but. Again, I guess I'm comparing it to a zoning issue even though the owners are generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1009)|
| 0:16:59| here as well. What is this permit for? It's for August. Let's see if we can work ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1019)|
| 0:17:09| through it. We did it last time. We've had these big Kroger's and other people come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| before. Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out how to ask personal questions to a corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| that nobody is here to answer them. Okay. The corporation, of course, is a corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| within the state of Tennessee. Yes, sir. And the principals are residents of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| of Tennessee? Yes, sir. Okay. Is the information on this application current and accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1050)|
| 0:17:38| Yes, sir. And does your principal corporation understand that they shall make no beer sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| to minors within Knox County? Yes, sir. Okay. Have any of the employees or owners located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| at this special event who's going to be at this special event location been convicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| of any violation of the laws against possession, sale, manufacture, transportation of intoxicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| liquors or crimes involving moral turpitude in the past ten years? No, sir. Is this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1084)|
| 0:18:13| the park? No, it's at the Harley Davidson. Oh, it's the Harley Davidson. They've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| programs there before. Has beer ever been sold at this location before, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| Not by the Copper Cellar Corporation. If it has been sold at that location, I'm unaware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| of it. I believe they used Prince's Deli last year. Okay. Okay. Okay. And this is a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| event, and so Copper Cellar's going to be operating this event on behalf of the Harley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| Davidson Company? Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. The people that are going to be there, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| familiar with the Knox County of Tennessee Beer Laws and Regulations, and do they agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| to conduct themselves in conformity with these laws? Yes, sir. Okay. The people that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| be there, have they completed their server training program? Yes, sir. The only people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| that will be operating and serving beer and food will be Copper Cellar employees who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| already completed the training. Okay. I don't know about these reports. Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| do we have anything on this? It's pending. My question would be, is this, how many days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| was this special event? No more than 12 days within the period. I'm sorry. No more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| 12 days of the period of, I saw it on here. September to November. Yeah, September to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| November. Things like every weekend or something? Any event that's operating more than one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1176)|
| 0:19:47| we have to pay for a special event permit, so we have to come to the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| Okay. Okay. Depending on the information from the business. Okay. It's pending. Do you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1194)|
| 0:20:03| what she's saying, ma'am? Can I ask one question to clarify? So before each event, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| have someone from Copper Cellar go to the Health Department and pay for a special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| permit through the Health Department. Right. If you're operating more than one day, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| it's a one-day event, you would need a permit to operate, but because you're operating more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| than one day, up to 14 days? Well, there will be individual days, so it won't be a span| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| of a two-day event. It will be a one-day event up to 12 times between September to November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| through November. Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Fire Marshal? No problem. Coach? No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1238)|
| 0:21:02| Sheriff's Department? I can't hear you, Wolfie. Yes. It's on premise, yes. They will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1262)|
| 0:21:12| a, I think they have a roped-off area there where they serve beer, if I recall how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| did this in the past. Yeah. That's not where you got your motorcycle, is it? No. I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| mine from Copper Cellar. Mr. Chairman? For those of you who don't know, he wrecked one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1284)|
| 0:21:33| Let's go ahead and go ahead and have the discussion. I know we don't have a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| but I think we need to have some questions answered before we get a clear motion. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| Commissioner Holmbie? Yeah, I just, I wanted to get clarification. So, the permit is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| the whole 12 days, or is it 12 different permits? Okay. Okay. I just didn't, I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1308)|
| 0:21:57| to clarify in my own mind that it wasn't 12 individual permits. In other words, if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| had one, two consecutive Saturdays, that could count as one under one permit, right? With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1322)|
| 0:22:12| it's within 14 days. Right. But, under, there are circumstances different, because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| consecutive days, but it's not consecutive days. Yeah. We have days that last, so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| state would have to get a permit from the operation. Can I, can, would they be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| to have a plan? Yes. And then maybe just one permit for those, would that be an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| We'll go in and explain, the corporation will go in and explain to my supervisor as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| to what the details are going to be. If there's any questions, the state of Tennessee will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| clarify what they need to do. Okay. Commissioner Hammond? Is this for your concert series?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| Yes, sir. So, you're looking at getting, like, you mentioned September through November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| you're looking at one per month, basically. Maybe during the winter months you won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| but you might get one September and then come back in March, so are you going to ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| It's between now and November. It's just two months. Yeah, I know, but I'm just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| as you move forward, this is for one time, but you'll be coming back for more in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| is that right? Sir, as I understand it, this permit would only last through November, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| if we do open up with a more regular concert series, for instance, a series that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| last more than 12 events, we would have to get a different type of permit, not a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| event, so I would come back and request a more permanent type permit. So, are you looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| at having a beer garden there, or will people be able to take their beer and go and sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| down? I'm trying to figure out logistics. Sure. From what I understand, we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| there with a food truck, and we would sell food and beer, and people would come to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| food truck, get their beverage, walk back to their seat, and enjoy the concert. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| so it won't be in a confined, roped-off area for the beer. They'll be able to go out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| go into the concert area for the amphitheater is what I'm asking. So you're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| have them confined to just a specific area. They'll be able to go out and enjoy the concert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| with the beer, right? I think so. Okay. Yes, sir. Okay, thanks. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I hate to be a stick-in-the-mud, but there's just too many questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| There's too many I thinks, and there's too many uncertainties on this. You know, to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| a lot of beer outside at a place to sell a motorcycle or a concert, there's just a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| of liability, and my concern is there's no one with that is that I don't want to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1483)|
| 0:24:57| the right word, that is employed by, that is a, you know, I know council represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1497)|
| 0:25:06| or is a consultant to, but what we have when we have Speedy Marts or whatever, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| district managers. You know, if something happens, was it Calhoun's, was it Harley-Davidson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| of Knoxville, I think we need to have someone with a vested interest that knows what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| logistics are going to be for this event. I know they're the 11th hour, but poor planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| on their part shouldn't necessitate a rush vote on ours. I just think there's too many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| holes for this event to rush a vote today. I think we don't know what this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1541)|
| 0:25:50| be. They had one, and I remember us talking about the Prince's Deli last year. This year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| they want something different, but we don't really know what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| I mean, you know, folks being able to walk around with a glass of beer is different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| being confined to Prince's Deli adjacent to the Harley-Davidson property. You can manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| that. Wolfe and Sheriff's Department can manage that a little better. So, I'm struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| with this. Right now, I'm not in favor of us moving forward with this without additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| information. You know, and my final point, I still think that, you know, not having someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| employed by either corporation is a little dangerous ground for us to be treading on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| Ms. Ferguson, are you an employee of a law firm, or are you an employee of Cupper Stella?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| I'm an employee of a law firm, and I would be glad to have a Copper Stella representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| but I was informed that I would be sufficient to come on behalf of my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| Okay. Who informed you of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Ms. Sandra in the County Commissioner's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| So, this is really the Copper Stella that's standing before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Okay. The other question is, is this a pay event? Do people have to pay admission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1622)|
| 0:27:10| this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Yes, sir. They'll purchase a concert ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Okay. So, the only way you get into the location is to pay an admission. So, I consider it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| to be a roped-off or cordoned-off area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| And if you would like me to get confirmation as to whether the purchasers of the beer will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| actually be on a patio area, or if they will be able to go into the amphitheater and sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| and watch the concert, and if you would like for me to clarify that distinction, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| be more than glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| I don't think that's a question before me. I believe it's one, we have a defined one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| One question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| By paid admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Right. The question I have, is there going to be a wristband, an ID check and a wristband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| issued for people to purchase beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| There will be an ID check upon the purchase of beer. I don't know that it will be a wristband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| upon entrance with your ticket, with your paid ticket, or if it will be at the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| of the food truck, and they will check individual IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| Right, because, Commissioner McKenzie, anyone can get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| Yeah, anybody can buy a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Eight-year-olds can buy a ticket and get in. So, just because you're beyond the rope doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| mean that you now are within the bounds. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| Well, one thing that I think is kind of a devil's advocate for Commissioner McKenzie's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| is, we just approved one at a park. So, I mean, there's not much little safety there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| So, I would advise you to get with the Sheriff's Office and have a good safety plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| And so, I want to, I guess, make the motion to approve with all the pendings, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| main pending will be with Ms. Nash at the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| So, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| And I strongly want to advise you to get with Captain May and get a good safety plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Because if it's going to be moving forward, we need to know what's going on, and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| prefer a wristband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| It doesn't have to happen that way, but I would prefer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| So, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1752)|

| 0:31:45| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1905)|
| 0:31:45| I'd like to add a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Last night, of course, we had tornado warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| And I would like a report on how our EAS system did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Mr. Harnish is here, and he's prepared to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| So if we could have that as a discussion item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1917)|
| 0:31:57| We'll have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Could we remove 702 from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| So I need to add a discussion item about the Second District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Second District School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| I have a question for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| It's a budgetary item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| I don't know if I should ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Now that 702's been pulled, that might be a better place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| at the end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| It's more of a generic budgetary question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| that addresses some information out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| about the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I can do it as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| I can do it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| I don't think we'll be here too awful long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| So we'll do it as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| because I think the school will be here the most time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| I'd like to defer 801 for 30 days, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1973)|
| 0:33:10| Mr. Chairman, I had mentioned last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| and I thought it would make its way onto this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| but I don't see it on the agenda discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| about Mark Donaldson's position and activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| OK, we can add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2002)|
| 0:33:30| Any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| Can we have a motion to defer and withdraw, defer, add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2015)|

| 0:47:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| I need to pause just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| I forgot to add something to the agenda, and I'll require a three-quarter vote to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| Do we need a two-thirds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| Do you need a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| I need to add a spread of the record for Board Member Miskin Cannon's resignation letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| that was received last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| So I need to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| And so I'll need a motion to add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Do we have any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Let it be noted that no one objected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| No one opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| It will be added to the agenda as spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2896)|
| 0:48:35| On page nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| approving a construction contract in the amount of $991,755.58| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| with Charles Baylock & Sons, Inc. for the bridge replacement on Connor Road over Bull Run Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| which amount includes $91,160 in utility relocation expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| that will be reimbursed to Knox County by Hollisdale Power Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| The 80 percent of the total construction cost is funded through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| Federal Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| and Knox County will provide 20 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| which will be estimated in the amount of $180,119.12 funded in current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| Dwight, is this the one we were waiting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| TDOT, do you mind to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2963)|
| 0:49:31| This is the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| I think somebody asked for no recommendation to see if you could get some things worked out with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| And as far as I know, we are still actually waiting to hear from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| I don't think there are any complications with it particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| It's just a matter of getting the forms out of their engineering office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| What is the preferred method of approving pending TDOT approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| We'd be comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Again, I don't anticipate any problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| It's pretty standard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| It's just a little bit slow in turning documentation this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| I'll make a motion that we accept or make a motion to approve pending TDOT approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| On page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3015)|
| 0:50:23| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| authorizing Knox County to enter into a four-year lease agreement with AgriCredit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| accept its LLC in the amount of $40,402.56 for golf carts at Three Ridges Golf Course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| first year funded through current budget and to be paid by user fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| Resolution 702.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Mr. Buch, will you speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| Certainly, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Mr. Chairman, this is an item for 72 electric golf carts and two gasoline-powered utility carts at the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3050)|
| 0:51:05| It's to be funded from user fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| It went through the purchasing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| This was a low bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| Club Car won the bid, and the financing is going to be through AgriCredit, which is a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| We are bound to one year at a time on this lease at the amount set out there, $40,402.56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3081)|
| 0:51:30| I've been working with Mike Reeves at purchasing and Doug Battelle on the phone with Club Car and AgriCredit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3090)|
| 0:51:39| who is a third-party leasing company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| We had some problems not with the terms, not with the amount or the number of carts or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| but with regard to some language that AgriCredit had in their basic lease agreement, such as indemnity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3109)|
| 0:51:58| that we're not allowed under law to do, and we're trying to iron those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| But in an effort to go ahead and get this done because the season is starting to run short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| I suggested to Commissioner Norman that we go ahead and approve this as it is, if commission so desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3130)|
| 0:52:18| subject to the law department's final approval of the final contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| That way we don't have to go through all this and come back and lose a possible month of income coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3143)|
| 0:52:32| Okay, so I'd like to make a motion to approve, providing the law department irons out these difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3152)|
| 0:52:40| Okay, we've got a motion and a second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Is that replacing every golf cart they've got? I mean, that's quite a few golf carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| Yes, they need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Is it smart to replace all of them at one time, should you not stagger them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| Warranties and stuff like that, it's just so much easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| On page 19, other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3192)|

| 0:53:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Spread of record, Commissioner Rawls, travel expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Discussion regarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Spread of record on Indiakin Canyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| Spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| And the spread of record on Indiakin Canyon's resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| Discussion regarding the Richard Settles termination case from the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Okay, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| I brought this before us as a discussion item primarily because of attending the July 2nd Board of Education meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3250)|
| 0:54:22| I witnessed the last episode that Mr. Settle has gone through in terms of the attempts to terminate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3262)|
| 0:54:35| And this saga began three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| Now, given that we don't have any jurisdiction in terms of the specifics of Mr. Settle's case, what I think that you'll see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3280)|
| 0:54:55| and if you haven't already viewed the tape of the Board of Education meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| what you will realize is that besides the persecution or prosecution, and certainly persecution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3302)|
| 0:55:15| that Mr. Settle has gone through in these three years, this has been a colossal waste of time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3315)|
| 0:55:25| And I think this board needs to hear it a little more intimately, and certainly the citizens of Knox County need to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3325)|
| 0:55:36| For many times, we just acquiesce to the board on so many things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| and I certainly hope that the new commission, the new board, delves into some of these difficulties for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3343)|
| 0:55:56| Mr. Settle's case is one of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| I've been told there's some close to 25 grievances filed so far for the coming year on what happened last year in the evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3361)|
| 0:56:14| So just that as a prelude, and then what I want to do is just try to give a brief outline of what Mr. Settle's gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3374)|
| 0:56:24| and then when I'm finished, allow Mr. Settle to speak if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| This began in 2011, and probably with the evaluation process showing some deficient scores in terms of Mr. Settle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3392)|
| 0:56:47| His principal deemed him necessary to go through a process called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3407)|
| 0:56:57| or in whatever other parts of the policy deems necessary for him in the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| to go through something called an intensive assistance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| He went through this for a year, did everything that he was supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| among writing a book report on Marzano's hierarchy of needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| I mean, just a tremendous list of things that you could find details about in the assistance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3443)|
| 0:57:31| His mentor, Mr. Cheatham, at the end of that year found him very worthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3451)|
| 0:57:39| recommended him to be placed back in his normal position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| which he was a math teacher at Gibbs High School, very favorably viewed upon by his peers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3464)|
| 0:57:53| by parents who recommended him for their students, teachers that he worked with, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3473)|
| 0:58:04| Okay, anyway, after this assistance program, which went on for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3484)|
| 0:58:12| required him to have a monthly meeting downtown, come downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| meet with supervisory staff, HR, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| He had supervisory meetings every two to three weeks with other supervisors in his school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3504)|
| 0:58:34| just seven to eight observations during the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3514)|
| 0:58:42| Just a continual onslaught of burdensome activities for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| Anyway, he finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Mr. Cheatham recommended that he's in good standing, be reinstated, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3530)|
| 0:59:06| Trying to find the place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| The next year, in the classroom, that's 2012-13, his principal, Mr. Lynn Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3549)|
| 0:59:18| had him assigned to classes outside his area, PE classes, et cetera, some other classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3558)|
| 0:59:27| which made him unable to reach a certain TVAS score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| For those of you that are familiar with the scoring process, somewhat just an outline of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| it's something called TEAM, there's a section called TVAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| and then there's another local school evaluation component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3584)|
| 0:59:51| Well, because of Mr. Suttle's assignment in PE, he's a math teacher, couldn't get the TVAS scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3591)|
| 0:59:59| and so his composite score drops down enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| And so his principal can now recommend him for termination again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| All right, so he goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| That puts him into this cycle of where recommendation by the board has to take place for termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3610)|
| 1:00:21| It does so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| The superintendent's involved, of course, in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| And then Mr. Suttle has the opportunity, by process, to have a third-party review his case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3628)|
| 1:00:37| The third-party review takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| The third-party is by a lawyer named Scott Rings from Hamlin County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| who seems to handle a lot of these mediation cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| Mr. Rings finds that these charges, et cetera, are not worthy, nearly fall far short of recommending termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3651)|
| 1:01:04| He recommends he be reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| The hearings last for four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| Mr. Suttle, on the last day, has five hours of testimony in his portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3674)|
| 1:01:24| The next event was the July 2nd this year board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| where the board finally sees the wisdom of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3689)|
| 1:01:37| No, I think we'll go, rather than with the superintendent's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| to go against the third-party judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| they decide to go with Mr. Suttle and Mr. Rings' recommendation for the third-party hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3709)|
| 1:01:57| So I think the vote was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| If you viewed the proceedings, pretty interesting proceedings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| in that a couple of the board members, one in particular who has now resigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| sought desperately to try to attenuate Mr. Suttle's tenure, but failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3731)|
| 1:02:21| But it was just an amazing proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| Anyway, so far that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| The superintendent has the opportunity now to appeal this further to Chantry Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3751)|
| 1:02:40| I have no information about whether he will do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3760)|
| 1:02:48| So I wanted you to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| I wanted also for, because of the extreme nature of this case, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3771)|
| 1:03:00| I wanted to also ask the superintendent and the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| to account for all the direct and indirect costs of this effort over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3785)|
| 1:03:13| And so I drafted a letter for Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| I'll provide it for him shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| I've also provided it for the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| In the moments before the meeting, by the way, I asked Mr. Buch about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| and he reminded me there was one other cost in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| So I hope you won't forget the stenographer's fee for the 700 pages of transcripts in the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| which I didn't ask for in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| But that's kind of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| Just wanted you to hear it a little bit more, a little bit more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| I can't imagine the turmoil that angst, anxiety, fear, intimidation, threats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3831)|
| 1:04:02| There are many, many others embedded in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| Threats of insubordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| That phrase just always just, I'm just bewildered by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| But lots of other things in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| So I wanted you to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| And now I'd like for Mr. Suttle, if he'd like to speak, to come down and add to, amend, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3858)|
| 1:04:29| anything that I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| Hi, Mr. Suttle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| Normal procedure is name and address, obviously, and then five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| and then we'll go from there if you kind of get close to it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| My name's Richard Suttle, S-U-T-T-L-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| My address is 834 Freemason Street in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| And I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| Mr. Chairman and county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| I first want to thank Mr. Tony Norman for asking me to speak to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| regarding my experiences of the past year as a Knox County teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| who was recommended for termination and went through the process of appealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| what I believe to be an unfair and incorrect decision on the part of my school's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| My comments will be brief, and I'll be happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| A little over a year ago, on May 25th, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| I was called to my principal's office at Gibbs High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| informed that I was being recommended for termination as a teacher with Knox County School System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| I was told that the recommendation was based on my team evaluation scores from the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3943)|
| 1:05:51| These are calculated primarily from TVAS scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| which is a formula that is intended to show teacher effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| positive or negative on students' learning in the time period that we have them in class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| and from classroom observation ratings done by lead teachers, administrators, and other staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3969)|
| 1:06:20| That is using a five-point scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| By the time I received a formal letter from the school system in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| I had also been charged with failing to input grades, being late to class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| using inappropriate language in class, and excessive absenteeism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| I requested an appeal before an independent hearing officer, which took place in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| and as a result of a four-day hearing, I was reinstated as a teacher for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| That decision was appealed to the school board, and my reinstatement was upheld by the board on July 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| After the school board meeting, three articles were written in local newspapers about my case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| The average person reading those articles and the charges that were listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| would come away with a very negative impression of me as a teacher and as an employee in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| So I'd like to just in real general terms address some of the charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| The details of my case are spelled out in a 700-plus page transcript of the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4043)|
| 1:07:31| my attorney's 50-page summary brief, and the hearing officer's 20-page decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| To address each charge in detail would take four days, so we'll skip that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4057)|
| 1:07:51| From my perspective, and I believe in the opinion of the hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| many of these charges were proved to be either invalid or inaccurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| while others were exaggerated or taken completely out of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4079)|
| 1:08:08| These charges are the first time in my career in education as both a classroom teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| and as a college administrator that I've ever received an unsatisfactory evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| I was judged by test scores of students who struggled the most in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| They struggled for all sorts of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| I was happy to help them to succeed to the best of their ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| even though their best did not always meet the criteria deemed as acceptable by today's educational standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4112)|
| 1:08:40| Every student in these classes had failed their Algebra I requirement at least once, some more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4120)|
| 1:08:48| Fortunately, I was able to help most, but not all, pass the class and improve their test scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| I was able to help some of them have at least a little more confidence in their math abilities going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| I consider these accomplishments to be a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| At the risk of being immodest, I was able to produce equivalent or higher test scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| than other teachers at my school who occasionally taught one of these same repeater classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4151)|
| 1:09:18| My scores from the repeater classes were compared equally with standard classes and honors classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4158)|
| 1:09:27| I was also judged by a six-page instructional rubric that contains well over 100 indicators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| known as the team teaching model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| The teachers were told they needed to meet in every class every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| Similar to experiences I heard other teachers relate, I found myself teaching some of the worst lessons of my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4181)|
| 1:09:49| I found myself trying to teach in the straightforward, organized way I was accustomed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| and which so many students told me they found helpful, especially with a subject as confusing as math can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| while at the same time trying to remember to include the indicators I was told were essential to a quality lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| The results were sometimes disastrous, not to mention very stressful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| I eventually adjusted and tried to find a happy medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| I made sure to include the key elements from the team rubric in my classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| while trying to retain the elements of teaching that came naturally for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| One of the first things most prospective teachers used to be told in college is that you have to be yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| and find the most natural way for you to communicate effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| Despite the fact that I had success with students in the past, sometimes with very high TVAS scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| and often with math classes that ranked in the top ten in Knox County according to their average test scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4243)|
| 1:10:49| I was rated by some of my current administrators as an unsatisfactory teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4249)|
| 1:10:57| Please don't take these comments to suggest that I'm opposed to the idea of teachers receiving training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| to be more effective or that I'm against being evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| To the contrary, I would love to attend in-service training sessions that contain specific examples of methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| that teachers have found helpful in aiding comprehension in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| Such instruction is rare in the in-services we attend, and it is badly needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| I want to close by saying that Knoxville is my hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| This is where I grew up and where I went to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| I'm a proud member of the last graduating class from the old Farragut High School in 1976.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| I love Knoxville with all my heart, and I care deeply about the people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| As a teacher, I've always approached education with my priority being what will best fill the needs of each individual student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4302)|
| 1:11:50| I taught math at Gibbs High School to students who were going on to four-year universities or colleges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| and possibly some type of graduate study after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| I taught students who were looking forward to community college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| and hoping they would be successful enough to earn an associate's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| I taught others who couldn't wait to finish high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| so that they could attend the Tennessee School of Beauty and make a living styling hair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| and maybe one day own their own salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| Some students had an aptitude for technical skills and planned to attend trade school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| for electricians or engine repair or construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| My personal belief is that we ought to be providing educational opportunities for all these kids according to their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| That is what education is about for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| And I'm very grateful that I will have the opportunity to again help our students with their educational needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| both as professionals with ability and as people who can contribute to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| Thank you, Mr. Settle, and thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| Have you been contacted since the Board of Education meeting on July 2nd about your status, anything official in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4379)|
| 1:13:10| Have you been contacted by your principal-to-be about your assignment, anything in terms of this coming year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4390)|
| 1:13:20| Yes, I was contacted Friday by Human Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| and I was contacted over the weekend by the principal at my new school that I was assigned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4405)|
| 1:13:33| Okay, so what did they say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| What did HR say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| They said I had been assigned to Whittlesprings Middle School as a physical education teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4416)|
| 1:13:46| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| That's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| And so I assume the principal at Whittlesprings then contacted you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| Yes, she did, and to set up a meeting with me this week so that we could meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| How appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| Exactly what I'd expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| Thank you, Mr. Settle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| Commissioner Albee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4456)|
| 1:14:24| For you, Mr. Settle, the only question I have is, did you have an attorney during this whole process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4464)|
| 1:14:32| Yes, the Teachers Association provided an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| So there was a cost to someone that paid for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| Yes, well, I paid dues to the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| An unnecessary expense that really shouldn't have had to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| Okay, that's the only question I had for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| I'm kind of alarmed about this, for one, that he's been reinstated, and that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| but to not use his abilities as a math teacher and his expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| and to put him as a physical education teacher, not that they're not important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| but that is not your expertise, that's not where your knowledge is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| and I just find that kind of alarming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| It's almost a slap in the face for everything that you've been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| to turn around and put you as a physical education teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| I would hope that they would rethink that and utilize the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4529)|
| 1:15:36| and preferably in high school, because I'm assuming that that's really where your expertise lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4536)|
| 1:15:46| I've had concerns about the valuation system the whole time that it's been introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| I've talked to hundreds of teachers about the valuation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| and how the TVOS score is calculated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| and I'm kind of confused, I guess, on how you can get a four from supervisors sitting on your classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4564)|
| 1:16:14| and then you get a one because you're being graded on students you don't even teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4574)|
| 1:16:23| That is just, it doesn't make any sense to me, and it's not a fair evaluation system, I don't believe, for anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4583)|
| 1:16:33| and we've seen teachers of the year resign this year as well as in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| because of the evaluation system and the over-testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| I went to the meeting that Harry Brooks and Gloria Johnson and Bill Dunn all had last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4604)|
| 1:16:55| and it just made it stronger that my belief that we're testing our children way too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4615)|
| 1:17:10| The state and the federal only requires a certain amount of testing, and we do up and beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| and it's almost like we're teaching to the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| We're not teaching the students, and I don't feel that they're getting out of school what they should be getting out of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4639)|
| 1:17:28| but I'm glad that you persevered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| I hate that you had to go through that, and I would hope that they would move you into teaching math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4653)|
| 1:17:41| what your expertise is, and change the evaluation system to something more fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4661)|
| 1:17:49| because the teachers aren't against being evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| No one has ever contacted me and said, oh, we don't want to be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| They want to be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| They want to be evaluated, but it's got to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| It's got to be on a level playing field and evaluate them based on their students that they teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4683)|
| 1:18:10| So hopefully people, the board ed or superintendent will listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4690)|
| 1:18:18| and make necessary changes that are needed to boost morale in the teaching profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4698)|
| 1:18:28| because there's a lot of good teachers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| A couple of comments on this from Mr. Suttles, and I have one other one I want to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| I consider this more than just a slap in the face, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| They have effectively destroyed your teaching career when you get to the bottom line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4728)|
| 1:18:57| just because of somebody's overactivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| And again, like Commissioner Norman said, let's get to the bottom of how much this costs the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4742)|
| 1:19:11| Seven hundred pages of testimony, that alone has got to be $20,000 right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4751)|
| 1:19:22| Regardless, in addition to what all these lawyers cost, you asked about how the TVAS thing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4762)|
| 1:19:32| Listen to this description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| The TVAS score is a statistical manipulation of taking a child's past test score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4775)|
| 1:19:43| predicting a future score, and then comparing how the child actually scores the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| If there's a difference in the predicted score and the actual score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| that is thought to be an attributable to the teacher or the school, and thus a valid evaluation criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4794)|
| 1:20:02| Now, that's a bunch of BS if I ever heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| But this is what is going on with our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| The answer is hire another lead teacher, hire another teaching coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4810)|
| 1:20:18| Let's talk for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| If anybody else has any questions for Mr. Suttles, I'd like to get on one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4820)|
| 1:20:28| Let's stay on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| We've got some people that want to speak to Mr. Suttles, so let's stay on that and we'll come back to have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| I've got another question for Mr. Suttles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Mr. Suttles, given your new assignment, you only know you're teaching how many PE classes or all PE classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4838)|
| 1:20:47| All PE is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| So what do you think of immediately in terms of how your evaluation will take place in the coming year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4854)|
| 1:21:03| What is your thoughts about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| What can happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| What most likely will happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| What will happen if it happened like with Lynn Hill and Mr. Crockett's manipulation of your scores in your last assignment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4870)|
| 1:21:20| What do you look forward to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Well, I hope I would be treated fairly and based on my ability as a teacher, and that's what I would expect, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4883)|
| 1:21:38| But you're a math teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Yes, that is my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| I do want to add, actually my college major is physical education, but my teaching experience, which is 15 years in the classroom, has been teaching math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4903)|
| 1:22:02| You got a PE minor because you played basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| No, that was my major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| I majored in physical education, but I had a minor in math, and that's been pretty much all of my teaching experience has been teaching math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4929)|
| 1:22:21| I taught in the old city schools during the mid-'80s and then left to attend graduate school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4941)|
| 1:22:31| I worked in a college in administration for several years and then came home to teach again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| I'd like to – is Dr. McIntyre still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| I'd like to ask Dr. McIntyre a few questions, or Mike, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| Do you want to ask him some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Okay, why don't you go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| Let him answer for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| Is that what you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| Well, my questions have to do with Mr. Suttles' placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| Let's go ahead and finish with Mr. Suttles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| I think we need to be careful here in regards to our boundaries as far as we can't do anything with his placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| And I think as much as I disagree with the evaluations and the things that have went south in the school system in regards to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=4995)|
| 1:23:23| I think we need to be careful that we stick in our authority and jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| Well, our jurisdiction is the money that the taxpayers of Knox County spend in and how it's spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5009)|
| 1:23:37| We give them a block of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| I don't disagree with that, but teacher placement is not our –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| But how else are the people in Knox County going to know how they're wasting money if we don't tell them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| Well, I'm just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| They elect them to do that job, but if we don't let them know what's going on, I mean, it's a gestapo when you look at some of this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5029)|
| 1:23:58| Well, I don't disagree with some of the opinions, but I think that we need to be careful as a board what we're discussing and how we're covering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| One of the items that's breached here is Mr. Suttles' placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| I would contend that Mr. Suttles is a math teacher and Knox County citizens' taxpayers' money is most effectively spent on Mr. Suttles teaching math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5050)|
| 1:24:22| Now, if Mr. – Dr. McIntyre wants to speak to that, I'd welcome him to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| If he doesn't want to speak to it, that's his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| You know, I think a big part of this dialogue is okay to talk about, but to be quite honest, this body doesn't know whether Mr. Suttles is a quality teacher or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5076)|
| 1:24:51| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| We're up here passing judgment saying he should be put back in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| I think he should be at the high school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| No, I don't think his degree should matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| It should be what he's done for the last five years or 15 years or 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| Who are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| He's been judged and tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| Commissioner Brown, I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Well, you're talking, and I have the floor, so you must not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| Who are we to say where he should teach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| His ruling didn't say anything about put him back at another high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| So, and again, he may deserve to be in a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| I'm sure he's a, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| We as county commissioners don't know whether, we've not read one iota as a body of those 700 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5134)|
| 1:25:44| We've just sat here and listened for the last 30, 40 minutes to one side of a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| That's all we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| And we're passing judgment, saying decisions, hey, let's place him here, move him there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| What are we doing up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| And at the end of the day, all we're doing is going to talk because the board's going to do what the board's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| And so, again, I really don't mind this dialogue, but when we start talking about, well, I think he should be moved here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5164)|
| 1:26:14| or she should be moved there or this was a bad decision with zero total facts, that's when I start to say, hey, let's back off here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5174)|
| 1:26:27| We can discuss, but we're now passing judgment, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| I've heard, okay, he's taught one thing, but he has a degree in another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| It may be, I have a degree in physics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| I'm not doing anything related to physics now, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| And we've all done that as our careers progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| So who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Who knows why HR has done what HR has done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| So, again, and I'm not coming down on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| But what side I am coming down on is saying we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| We don't have those facts before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| We're not educated enough in this matter to make an informed decision, and that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| And when these things get out there in the press or in the court of public opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| people start making judgments that really shouldn't be made, and I just think that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| When these hearings occur, are these all behind closed doors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| You said this is the first time this has ever been brought in front of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| I'm just asking this because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| Is this all closed door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| I don't know the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| Was this done in executive session with the school board where the public wasn't involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| I may be confused, but I thought I read about this in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| Was this in the paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| This has one of these deja vu things to me because I think I read about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| and I'm asking someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| There were the details that Mr. Norman pointed out earlier about going to the third-party mediator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| and being overturned there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| Was all of that known?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| Has any of this been before the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Yeah, they had a July 2nd had a hearing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| I mean, was it an open session or closed session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| Open, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Open session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| Mr. Chairman, I attended that meeting also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| and I would think that what I heard was that it was decided by the Board of Education that he be reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5302)|
| 1:28:30| Yeah, it was an open session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| So what are we arguing about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| Right now, policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| Well, it sounds like the policy worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| Well, but at what cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Look, this is only one of a bunch of isolated incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| I can give you one more if you want it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| We had one here about a year or so ago with another teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| Well, let me ask, what should the policy be if we don't have an appeals process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| to fire people with no due process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| I mean, I'm asking, what should the process be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| It sounds like the process worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| Well, the process I'm talking about is the way that the administration handles the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| and what they do and their way of evaluating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| And if you want to go to talk to the school board, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| anybody can come to this podium right here and talk for five minutes on anything they want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| You go to the school board, you have to be clear to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| You could get in front of Obama quicker than you could get in front of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| I understand that, but, you know, it sounds like, I mean, there's an appeals policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| It was brought before the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| The school board decided to overturn the whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| This is one incident, one incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| But there are at least 25 other cases coming up that are going to be lawyer-involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| And their actions are costing the taxpayers of Knox County millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5392)|
| 1:30:00| not just thousands, but a whole bunch of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| I guess I'm still confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| If the process is wrong, what do we do away with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| I mean, how do you change the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| You've got two different processes involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| You're talking about the process of reclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| I'm talking about the process that started it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| Commissioner, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| Just to the statement, we don't know the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| The facts have been described and reviewed in detail at that Board of Education meeting on July 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5430)|
| 1:30:40| Was that open or closed, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| That's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Yeah, I mean, that's just a board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| It was at the end of a board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| I guess what I was saying was I thought this was the first time this had been brought before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| And so the publication of the third-party hearing officer's recommendation, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5453)|
| 1:31:00| the review of the board, the testimony that was given at the Board of Education meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| the counsel that was given by Ms. McCoy on behalf of Mr. Suttle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5465)|
| 1:31:14| rebutted everything that had been provided as evidence against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5474)|
| 1:31:20| So those facts have been thoroughly reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| And that's the reason why to hear now this is an example of retribution, pure and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5483)|
| 1:31:31| Assign him to a new school and give him PE classes, something that he does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| That's not his area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| Two things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| My point is I'm sure Commissioner Norman is well-versed in everything that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| What I'm saying is this body isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| And I would doubt that very many commissioners have dug in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| has taken a deep dive into this particular topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| Commissioner Norman has obviously, and I'm sure Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| having attended the meeting, is a little more well-versed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| But this body is probably not versed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| So that's one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| And then my second point, in line with what Commissioner Briggs is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5539)|
| 1:32:28| every entity, every corporation, every company, governmental agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5548)|
| 1:32:36| more than a few employees has to have some kind of human resource process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5556)|
| 1:32:46| If you talk with Mark Jones, he deals with employee issues probably hourly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5566)|
| 1:32:54| I'm sure there's more than eight a day that fall into his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| And that comes from a supervisor saying Joe Blow is not doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| And then he has to vet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| Some he agrees with the supervisor and some he agrees with the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| But there has to be that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| So to say that this shouldn't have ever gone to an appeal process is maybe a little short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5594)|
| 1:33:21| In this case, the principal may have been wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| Again, I don't know, not dug in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| But to say that we need to just throw out the whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| either we need to just keep everybody, which everybody's a winner, everyone's number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| we kind of know that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| So there are going to be some terminations that are going to happen through a natural course of hiring X number of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5623)|
| 1:33:53| 1,000, 900, whatever employees that the school system has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| So there's going to be a hiring and a firing and a leaving and a promoting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| And so there has to be an appeal up through, sounds like in this case, courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| And that's my second point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| Just the fact that it went to the school board is basically saying that the process is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5653)|
| 1:34:19| It may not work how we like it, but it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| It's being exercised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| I won't say it's working like we want this to happen, but it's being exercised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| I mean, that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| I wish it didn't happen this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| But the fact that something had to go to the school board, you know, it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| And the fact that some things bubble up to Mark Jones in human resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| instead of being handled at the employer-employee level, it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5686)|
| 1:34:55| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| I agree things happen, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| but when they start happening too many times to too many different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5700)|
| 1:35:07| I'm not trying to sit here and say we can set their policy for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| I'm just trying to inform the people in Knox County that they got crap going on over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| that's making the teachers scared to even take time out to go to the bathroom and leave their classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5716)|
| 1:35:25| I've got volume of notes and e-mails from teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| South Dole Middle School had five, whatever you call them, teachers, master teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5732)|
| 1:35:42| Four of them were supposed to be leaving at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| I haven't gotten back to check on that to see if that actually happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| But the teachers are disgruntled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| If they want to go to the school board, they've got to be cleared by Lynn Fugate first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5756)|
| 1:36:02| before they can come and talk to the school board if it's anything adverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| But now if you want to go up there and tout, it's the double standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| If you want to come up there and tell the school board how great they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| you can stand there and talk all night, well, at least for your five minutes, even on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| But if you have a legitimate complaint that you feel is legitimate, try getting on the agenda to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5777)|
| 1:36:27| And all of these lawsuits, again, this costs Knox taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5787)|
| 1:36:35| Not only is it destroying this man's career, and it's not the first time that it's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| I've had teacher after teacher tell me. I've got one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| He's 65 years old. I love teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| I could teach another five years, but I can't take five more years of this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| I'm out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| You know, here's a lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| She was an assistant principal at Ricky McLeod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| She had fives on her evals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| She's a 23-year employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| The last nine as successful assistant principal thought she had a way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| Then she gets called into human resources and said, okay, bang, you're back in the classroom at a 25% reduction in her salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5836)|
| 1:37:27| No explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| Then she said, well, maybe I've got a little ace in the hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| and that I've been here long enough I can qualify for one of those Apex financial help bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5854)|
| 1:37:42| Well, then she goes to check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| It says employee no longer in good standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| Why is she not in good standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| Being reclassified as a classroom teacher after being an administrator automatically made her ineligible for the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5871)|
| 1:38:00| If this system was in corporate America today, there would be some serious reconstruction going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5880)|
| 1:38:07| Let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| They'd have one hell of a revolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| Maybe that's what it's going to take from the rest of these teachers to do this, to stand up and put the bell on the cat to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5891)|
| 1:38:19| But we've got to get something done in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| It's terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| Here's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| Twenty years building a very good professional reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| Now, after one test, I'm suddenly labeled ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| How can that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| How can that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| It is not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| I don't care whose formula you use, if it's Common Core, ProThemis, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| that outfit you paid a million and three to come down here and tell you to get rid of the janitors or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| It ain't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| Because we don't deal with the school matters, and I don't mean to put Dr. McIntyre on the spot, but I'm just trying to get data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5935)|
| 1:39:03| How many school teachers do we have altogether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| Thank you, Commissioner, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Jim McIntyre, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| We have about 4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| Okay, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| And I understand from Commissioner Brown we have 25 people that have gone through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| We've got that many now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| There's about that many now that are filing suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| I used 25, so that's 0.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| How many teachers have actually lost their jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| So I actually went through this data fairly recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| I believe it's we have brought charges to terminate, and the school board has voted on that termination in about a dozen to 14 or 15 cases since 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=5985)|
| 1:40:02| So that's 0.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| And the evaluation system, and I'm asking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| These aren't questions that I know the answer to, so I'm not trying to lead up from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| Is the evaluation system that we use here, how does it differ from Sevier County or Oak Ridge or Nashville or Memphis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6016)|
| 1:40:26| There are certain requirements for performance evaluation for teachers that are written into state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| Those include the evaluation of every teacher every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| that at least 50% of that evaluation will be based on student outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| and that another component of that will be classroom observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6040)|
| 1:40:48| We use the team evaluation model, Tennessee Educators Acceleration Model, which is used by the majority of school systems across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6048)|
| 1:40:59| And it meets the statutory requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| So that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| So these are statutory requirements that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| Dr. McIntyre, what do you consider a successful teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6072)|
| 1:41:19| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| What do you consider a successful teacher to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| In what regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| Generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6085)|
| 1:41:33| What does it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| So you're talking about a philosophical discussion you'd like to have about what I believe a successful teacher is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| What would be the top three key points that a good teacher should have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| I believe a good teacher provides high-quality instruction to students and leads them to high-level learning and student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6107)|
| 1:41:56| I think there's a variety of measures for success for teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| but I think they really revolve around making sure that we support, develop, grow, teach, and help our students to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6122)|
| 1:42:15| Why is it that the only people get promoting to principals are ones that have gone through your little academy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6135)|
| 1:42:26| That's actually not correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| It appears to be, from what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| And I talk to a lot of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| Okay, but it's objectively, demonstrably not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| We just appointed Mr. Jason Webster as the head principal at Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| He has not gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| I can cite many examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| Would you consider a teacher of 23 years' experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| nine of them as an assistant principal, 14 in a classroom with good evals, a candidate for principal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6177)|
| 1:43:08| I really think it depends on the individual and the work that they've done and the skills that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| I think that's a very important question, and it's one that I take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| I not only appoint all of our head principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| I interview all of our assistant principal candidates, all of our administrative assistant candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| because that's one of the most important things that I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| is make sure that we have great leadership at the helm of each and every one of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| That's a responsibility that I take very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| and one that I spend a great deal of time making sure that we have the right candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| who have the right skill set and the right fit for each of our appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| for head school principals and assistant principals as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| What happens if they don't buy into every little bit of your philosophy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| They don't get the job, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| If they don't buy into my philosophy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| I think that we want to make sure that principals have, that candidates for the principalship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6245)|
| 1:44:11| have the skills and knowledge and competencies that they need to be effective leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| and to make sure that students are learning and growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| and are prepared for a bright, competitive, and successful future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| It's not about my philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| It's about working toward our goals as a school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| and working toward what our community expects in terms of high-quality education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| and excellence in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| But you also have teachers with less than five years' experience as evaluators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6276)|
| 1:44:43| going out here and evaluating teachers who've got 20-, 25-year experience too, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| Commissioner, there are many cases where experience leads to more effective teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| but there are some instances where that is not the primary factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| in whether or not a teacher is an effective teacher or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| We have some really outstanding teachers who have five or ten years of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6303)|
| 1:45:10| and we have some teachers who are not as effective who have 30 or 40 years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| I'm not sure that's the primary determining factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| If you were teaching in a classroom and you had them hounding you day after day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| how could you keep your mind on teaching the subject you were supposed to be teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| and with Big Brother looking over your shoulder every move you made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| I mean, would you feel comfortable doing the job under those circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| As we've discussed in this forum in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| our intention in putting forth and meeting the requirements for performance evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6340)|
| 1:45:48| under the statute in the state of Tennessee is we want it to be a developmental process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| We want to help our teachers get better at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| We want to have a growth mindset where we're constantly thinking about how we get better at what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6357)|
| 1:46:04| And that's really the perspective that we try to bring to the evaluation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| that it's about continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| It's about great instructional practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| It's about making sure our kids are learning and getting a great education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| And that's the perspective with which we come to the evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6379)|
| 1:46:25| Well, I don't know this, Sheila Earle, but as a Knox County citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| would you find out why what happened to her happened to her and get back with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6389)|
| 1:46:41| Is that confidential information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| Well, yeah, it's a personnel action that we took,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| and there may be some confidential information involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| Well, every one of those files over there are open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| These guys sitting down here can go over there and get those files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| I'm asking you to get back with me and let me know why this happened to this lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| And several of them have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| I said several of them have looked at Ms. Earle's file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| Well, you're not answering my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| Will you look into this and get back with me and tell me why this happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| Commissioner, if you'd like to have a conversation about it, I'm glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| But, again, I'll have to respect the confidentiality of those aspects of the personnel record that are confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6435)|
| 1:47:25| Well, you don't have to come back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| You can call me and tell me my answer to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| If you'd like to sit down and talk about it, glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| First, I guess, do we have plans to go on with this, Chancery Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| Do we have plans to go on with what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| With Mr. Suttle's case to challenge the appeal in Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| I don't believe I will move forward with an appeal to Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| And why would you not do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| I believe we've come to a point where the Board of Education has, I think, made a decision, and I'm willing to live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6484)|
| 1:48:15| Why were you willing to challenge the third-party hearing officer's contention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| Well, first of all, Mr. Chairman, we've been at this for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| And, you know, the termination of teachers under Tennessee statute is given exclusively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6504)|
| 1:48:31| the power and authority is given exclusively to local boards of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| So I really, I do fail to see how this is appropriate business before the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| But, you know, I'm glad to answer whatever questions I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6520)|
| 1:48:46| Are you going to provide us with the cost when not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| I would say that several of our school board members have expressed considerable concern about this particular item being on your agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6529)|
| 1:48:56| Because it is within their purview and not within yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| However, are you going to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| Are you going to respond to the cost issue for this episode with Mr. Suttle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6543)|
| 1:49:11| You have said that you're going to send me a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| I'm glad to see what that letter has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| So you think that if I request direct interest cost estimates, accounting, you'll be able to supply that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6555)|
| 1:49:22| I'm certainly doing my best to be responsive to your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| One thing to Dr. Briggs there before I forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| I would like to add that, yes, we do meet the statutory requirements for evaluations for the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6577)|
| 1:49:44| But there are substantial differences in terms of what Knox County actually does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| and also in how those results are interpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| There are substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| Can I ask one more question about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| Is this a standard thing we're using or is this a homemade evaluation system we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6596)|
| 1:50:06| I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| You mean the rubric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| I'm not going to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| I'll say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| No, Commissioner, it is actually the default model for teacher performance evaluation in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6615)|
| 1:50:23| The Tennessee Department of Education entertains waivers to do different models that meet the statutory requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| but this is the default model for the teacher evaluation for the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6629)|
| 1:50:39| I'm learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| I'm not taking sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| What do we do differently in Tennessee than the default model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| I don't have all those details right here, and so I don't want to misstate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| I think I see Ms. Absher right here, and she's going to either write an article or be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| She's already written an article about that, but I don't have all those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| But what I remember, and we all experienced this at our board, school board, and what do we call that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6667)|
| 1:51:18| Kumbaya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| Retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| Retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| So we had a representative from another system, and we were talking about evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6682)|
| 1:51:31| and what clearly came through there was the totally different environment which teachers experience in other systems compared to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6691)|
| 1:51:43| They have the same, fundamentally the same system, but it's how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| It's the climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| It's the culture that is employed in Knox County, which makes it so different, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6711)|
| 1:51:58| I just wanted to say one other thing and ask Dr. McIntyre one other thing, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6718)|
| 1:52:06| The end of this process seemed to be orchestrated by the principal and assistant principal, Lynn Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6726)|
| 1:52:14| and a Mr. Crockett, I believe was his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| I am curious about what I'm not expecting an answer right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| but I do wonder about what is now, given the outcome and all of this tremendous time and expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6742)|
| 1:52:30| what is going to happen with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| I hope certainly they're evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| The look that goes towards them is at least as intense as is going towards Mr. Suttle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| And then my last question for you, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| is I'd like for you to make some kind of comment about Mr. Suttle's assignment as a PE teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6764)|
| 1:52:56| Thank you, Commissioner, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| You know, I'm really not inclined to discuss the placement of our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| but I mean I will say this because you've asked why I appealed the hearing officer's decision to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6782)|
| 1:53:13| And part of the reason is I thought the record actually was fairly clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| that showed that Mr. Suttle was an ineffective teacher, as outlined in Tennessee state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6798)|
| 1:53:26| and also that the hearing officer found that Mr. Suttle was guilty of conduct unbecoming the teacher profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| which is reasonable cause for termination in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| but the hearing officer decided in his ruling, in the way he laid out the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6816)|
| 1:53:44| that while that is a cause for termination, it wouldn't be his recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| You know, this is a unique case in that we typically don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| and can't talk about teacher growth scores, TVA scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| But because Mr. Suttle appealed the hearing to the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| his are actually now part of the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| And what you see when you look at the 800 pages of documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| is that Mr. Suttle, at the end of 2012, had a three-year composite TVA score of negative 4.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6851)|
| 1:54:22| Negative 4.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| That not only puts him on the extreme far end of low performance of teachers in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6866)|
| 1:54:34| but on the extreme low end of performance of teachers across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| He, Mr. Suttle, had multiple years of performance evaluations where he did not meet expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| and he was recommended for termination by his principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| So I felt, based on those facts and based on the enormous volume of information that's in the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6890)|
| 1:54:59| and in the file, that pursuing termination in this case was the right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| for the children of Knox County, for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| And, you know, stood by that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| The hearing officer overturned that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| and the Board of Education affirmed the hearing officer's decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| and I'm willing to live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| And we will place Mr. Suttle in a position where he will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| that is in one of his areas of certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| but where he will not be in a subject area where he scored a negative 4.02 composite TVA score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6931)|
| 1:55:43| I think, let's get, we've got some people to sign up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| We've had, I think we've went a little deeper into the personnel file of Mr. Suttles than we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6946)|
| 1:55:52| One quick last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| I think you've made your, I mean, I think we've beat the horse on Mr. Suttles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| and I want the public that signed up to speak to speak, and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| The first person, and I hope I've pronounced this right, Lynn Schneider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6963)|
| 1:56:11| If you'll give your name and address for the record, ma'am, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| Lynn Schneider, 2742 Barringer Station Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| I just have to address one thing that I heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| Twelve to fourteen people, I think Dr. McIntyre said, were recommended for termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| I think you said 0.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| What if one of those people was unjust?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| That's a very small number, 0.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| But what if one of those teachers was terminated unjustly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| That's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| So just to put it into small numbers and say, well, only twelve to fourteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| and only a small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| Teachers are people. Teachers have lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| And we can't reduce us to numbers anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| Now I'll start with my speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| Thank you for the opportunity for my voice to be heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| I want to start by saying that I loved teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| I absolutely loved the kids that I taught, and I continue to want the very best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| But I do have some concerns that I would like to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| After teaching in Knox County schools for fourteen years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| I resigned at the end of the 2013-14 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| There were many factors that played into my decision to leave the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| but the primary reason was that I could no longer work in a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| where I felt that the best interests of my students were not being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| High-stakes testing does not create an environment that is conducive to real learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| In fact, it impedes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| I grew so weary of watching my students struggle to learn required objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| when they had not yet mastered the foundational skills necessary to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| My frustration came in knowing that I didn't have the freedom to adjust my plans accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7066)|
| 1:57:52| While my concern for students is paramount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| today I want to tell you what high-stakes testing and the teacher evaluations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| based on that testing are doing to exceptional, experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| and passionate teaching professionals in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| As I'm sure you are aware, Race to the Top requires teachers in all grades and subjects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| to be evaluated in part based on student test scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| Tennessee uses the value-added system known as TVOS in the teacher evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| Commissioner Brown said earlier that this is a statistical process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| using a student's past test scores to predict the student's future test scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| on the assumption that the students usually score as well each year as they have in past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| The student's actual score is then compared to the predicted score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| The difference between the predicted and actual scores is assumed to be due to the teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| not the student's natural ability or any socioeconomic circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| So up to 35% of a teacher's evaluation is based on a statistical model's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| to predict how Johnny is going to do on his TCAT this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| And if he doesn't do as well as predicted, the teacher must accept all the blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| There is growing evidence that the value-added measures method is not reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| Recent reports, including the position statement released by the American Statistical Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| indicate surprisingly weak correlations between value-added measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| and other quality teacher indicators, including teacher observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| But our superintendent fully supports the TVOS scores used in the team evaluation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| But I'm not confident Dr. McIntyre's nine-month turn as a classroom teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| can begin to give him any sense of what makes an effective teacher or how to best evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| As you know, TCAT scores were to count as part of students' grades this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| as they did the previous two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| However, you may recall that the QUIC scores were held by the Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| so that they could be post-equated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Commissioner Kevin Huffman did not allow the release of the scores in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| to be factored into the students' grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| I have to believe it's because the TCAT data is at the very least suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| But this faulty, suspicious TCAT data is still being factored into teacher evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| An unusual number of teachers who received fives on their TVOS scores last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| received ones this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| How is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| Can we really trust TCAT scores that suggest an exceptional teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7220)|
| 2:00:27| has suddenly become an ineffective teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| I, like most teachers, never minded it being evaluated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| as long as it was fair and based on sound educational practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| There was a time when principals were able to visit classrooms informally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| and observe authentic teaching and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| There was no fancy rubric of 61 metrics to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| but I guarantee that those principals had a better idea of teachers' abilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| than will ever be reflected in a team evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| Leaving the teaching profession after 14 years was not an easy decision for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7258)|
| 2:01:08| I became a teacher because I do love kids, and I wanted to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| It would have been a lot easier to jump through the hoops and play with the games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| and if I had been focused on myself, that's exactly what I would have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| but my focus was not on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| And I knew then, as I know now, that this path of so-called education reform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| is not about the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| Over the past several months, I've had the pleasure of meeting many wonderful educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| who love teaching, who love their students, and who truly want to restore education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7298)|
| 2:01:44| These teachers have been courageous and steadfast in their mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| to redirect our school system back to the business of fostering the love of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| the love of learning, and guiding students to become caring, productive citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| I've been extremely disheartened by the attempt of several members of the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| not only to dismiss, but to cast a negative light on the effort of these concerned teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| and now they want to limit their ability to speak on behalf of their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7329)|
| 2:02:14| Commissioners, I want to thank you for passing an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| protecting the free speech of all county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| Please do all you can do to protect their right to speak in public forum at school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7340)|
| 2:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| Thank you. Any questions for Ms. Schneider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| The next name is Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7350)|
| 2:02:39| If you'll give your name and address for the record, Mr. Taylor, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| Good afternoon. I'm Mark Taylor. I live at 12912 Sycamore Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| And like Lynn, before I begin my speech, I'm going to add one more point to this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7367)|
| 2:02:52| of how many teachers have been fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| And that much more important, or at least equally important consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| is how many teachers have resigned or left the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| Great teachers like Lynn, who our children now will never have the opportunity to teach from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| because of what's happening in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| But anyway, first I'd like to thank Tony Norman and the entire county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| for giving us the opportunity to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| Your continued commitment to the right to have our voices heard is greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| I want to start by telling you why I teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| I absolutely love it. It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| I believe I have a gift for teaching, and that's what I'm supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| To me, teaching is not a job. I'd do it for free if I had the means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| My love for teaching and my students is why I'm standing before you here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7410)|
| 2:03:35| I've always said I will only teach as long as I can do what is best for children, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| When I'm put in a position where I'm forced to put my students second, I will no longer teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| Sadly, in Knox County schools, that day is coming quickly for many of us, if not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| Mr. Suttle's case makes me speak to how any teacher in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| could find themselves in the exact same position, any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| Because of the flawed Knox County schools evaluation system, we are all at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| It could be any one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| I'm going to try to show you some of the ways Knox County schools' evaluation system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| is putting teachers in the position of having to do what is best for ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| to keep our jobs rather than focusing on our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| I know much has been said about the evaluation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| but I'm going to attempt to give you some specific examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| and show they are hurting our students and putting our careers at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| Obviously, I'm going to be talking about the teacher evaluation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| but please, please understand the real issue is what the evaluation system is doing to our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| how it's cheating them out of a meaningful education and turning them into someone else's pawns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| First of all, the rubric that you've heard so much about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| The rubric contains approximately 61 teaching strategies or tools, all of which are proven strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7484)|
| 2:04:51| Without a doubt, all of those should have a place in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| However, teachers are expected to use all those strategies when they're being observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| This is absurd to anyone who's ever been in a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| Every lesson is different. Every class is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| To use every point on the checklist in every lesson would result in very little learning at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| Teachers have been told, I have been told, when you are being observed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| it's no longer about what is best for your students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| It's about hitting all the points on that checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| We have been told, I have been told, when observed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| you are to do what's best for your score and not for your students' learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| Put yourself first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| As a teacher, it's absolutely sickening to be told I have to put myself ahead of my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| I won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| This is against everything a teacher or principal should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| but it's the reality of this evaluation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| The best simile I can use to describe it is that of a surgeon being observed while doing a tonsillectomy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7544)|
| 2:05:51| and having the observer penalize him because he did not use the colonoscopy scope during the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7551)|
| 2:05:58| How would you like to be the tonsillectomy patient that did have the doctor also use the colonoscopy scope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7558)|
| 2:06:04| That surgeon scored higher, but at whose expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| At the start of this new system, teachers were told our overall summative goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| which consists of our TVOS scores and observation scores combined, was a rock-solid 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7572)|
| 2:06:19| Our goal was to score a 3 out of 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| We were told it's not all about test scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| They're just one part of the evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| Yet here's the reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| Teachers who scored an overall 3 have gotten conference of concern letters threatening termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7587)|
| 2:06:33| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| Because their TVOS was a 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| Even though their overall score was a 3, how can they say test scores are not the priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| and then let that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| The reality is teachers are scoring 4s and 5s on observations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| but being labeled as ineffective teachers because of TVOS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| These teachers are then required to have double the observations the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| even though they scored 4s and 5s on their observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| Where is there any logic in that reasoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| Imagine the time, man hours, and money spent on all these additional observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| Imagine how much better it could be spent with our children's interest in mind instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| Another unbelievable reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| teachers who teach one subject have gotten their TVOS reports back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| only to find that they were credited with a different subject than the one they taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| For example, a science teacher's TVOS consisted of social studies students' test scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7644)|
| 2:07:30| Mistakes happen, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| but when the teacher brought it up and mentioned filing a grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| they were told the social studies scores were pretty good, so just keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| You can't make this stuff up, but it's happening in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| Two teachers in the same school both taught the same non-tested subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| so both were forced to take the school-wide TVOS score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| When they got their TVOS score notifications, they had different scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| Same selection, yet different scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| A self-evaluation is part of every teacher's observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| Teachers score themselves on the same rubric the observer uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| then they discuss their scores with the observer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| If a teacher scores themselves more than two points different than what the observer did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| they're forced to change their own self-score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| or if not, they'll get penalized on their professionalism rubric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| The professionalism rubric is a whole other fiasco that I'm not even going to go into today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| Lead teachers, observers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| told if the observation scores they give a teacher are not within two points of the teacher's TVOS scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7706)|
| 2:08:34| the observer will have additional training to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| Teaching a lesson that gets observed during an unannounced observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| teachers then have to go back and write a lesson plan after they've already taught the lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| Does that make any kind of sense or add anything of value to any of my students' learning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| It's a meaningless waste of time that could otherwise be spent directly on student learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| But that's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| We constantly hear Knox County schools tell us that they can't change these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| They're state mandated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| We all know now that that's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| Knox County chooses to do these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| whether we're talking about accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| or the evaluation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| Knox County is choosing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| The state is making us is no longer a valid excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| It's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| I have about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| Other districts across the state are making their own changes to the evaluation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| are using different systems altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| yet we plug ahead with a flawed system at our students' expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| Again, I would like to thank the County Commission for this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| and I would like to thank you for the work you have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| to ensure our freedom to speak without retribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| I find it very ironic that at the same time you are protecting that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| the Knox County BOE is fighting to take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| I would like to ask that you continue that fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| to keep the rights of all our citizens to speak during the Knox County BOE meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| Any questions for Mr. Taylor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| Just your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| Jennifer Nagel, 6208 Bryan Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| Good afternoon. My name is Jennifer Nagel, and I would like to speak to you about my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| My daughter is 8 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| She attends a Knox County public school, and she has dyslexia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| I am concerned because dyslexia is not a term the Tennessee schools use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| My daughter has been struggling with reading since kindergarten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| and I have heard a lot of, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| be patient, it will just click.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| My daughter is about to go into third grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| and she is reading at an end-of-kindergarten level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| How much longer do I have to wait before it clicks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| I realize my daughter had dyslexia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| and I went to her teacher and a few others in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| and I was told, quote, we don't use the term dyslexia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| We call it a learning disability in reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| Here is my problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| Dyslexia is listed as a specific learning disability in federal IDEA law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7860)|
| 2:11:03| Her teacher told me she has never been trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| on how to help a dyslexic child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| I was told by someone else to read with her more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| Take her to a building called a library where I can get free books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| so she can read, and that would help her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| My daughter's teacher had no training to help her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| and when I was told to just make her read more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| I realized the problem isn't just with our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| None of the staff understands what dyslexia is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| Just reading more will not help a dyslexic student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| So what is dyslexia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| Dyslexia is an impaired ability to understand written language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| a learning disorder marked by a severe difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| in recognizing and understanding written language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| leading to spelling and writing problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| It is not caused by low intelligence or brain damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| Dyslexia affects one in five people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| That means 20% of Knox County students have some form of dyslexia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| Dyslexics use a different part of their brain than other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| Reading more won't help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| What will help is training for our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| in how to teach a dyslexic student how to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| using the portion of their brain they do use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| July 1, the Dyslexia Is Real bill went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| This law requires the Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| to collaborate with institutions of higher education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| to formally address dyslexia and similar reading disorders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7942)|
| 2:12:26| by providing teachers web-based or in-person training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| providing effective instruction for teaching students with dyslexia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| using appropriate scientific research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| and brain-based multi-sensory intervention methods and strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| This bill has been interpreted to mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| that teachers still in college will receive training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| but not teachers currently in classrooms because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| we don't want to add one more in-service training for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| I have heard from many teachers that want to learn about dyslexia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| They want to help their students, but they aren't going to get the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| This greatly upsets me as a parent of a dyslexic child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| Because the schools do not use the term dyslexia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| it will never be a topic on one of the school board's agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| I know you can't do anything about dyslexia training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| but I am worried that my ability to take my needs to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| is being threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| They have said we have to go through the proper channels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| and document that before we can even speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| This is a policy issue, and they set the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| Please protect my right to speak freely before the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| as I have before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| Any questions for Ms. Nagel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| Yes, ma'am. I have one question before you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| Have you asked to speak before the school board and been turned down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| Not personally, because this is a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| Not personally, because this is a new policy that they're trying to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| so I have not been turned down as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| If that happens, would you please contact us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| Because a dog don't hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8042)|
| 2:14:08| A lot of hunting dogs today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| One more person, and I hope I don't get this wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| Vinny Anastios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| I think he may have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| Vinny Anastios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| Is he gone? I think he's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| Let me just add the one last comment that I was going to make a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| I realize and I know that all the rest of you sitting up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| know that we cannot set their policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| and do anything in the world about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| but we have every legal right in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| to question why and how they do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| That is the way we get information to the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8090)|
| 2:14:53| and if you don't believe I'm right, ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8093)|
| 2:14:58| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8098)|
| 2:15:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| I'm not really speaking to the issue that's before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| I'm really going to say something about what Knox County does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| I'm going to call out Dwight Vandervate's name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| or Hugh Holt's name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| or I could call Dean Rice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| or Doug Patel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| but a couple of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| the length of this section has wore them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| In fact, I believe I can see it wearing on all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| but the most important thing that I think I need to recognize today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| is that we have a couple of members-elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8138)|
| 2:15:47| to the Board of Education here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| observing how we go about talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| what takes place in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| and the reason I named those people that may be disappointed earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| is the fact that their portion of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| is a lot smaller than the portion of the budget we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| That's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| Ms. Bounds is in recess right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| and Ms. Roundtree is cooling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| until my birthday right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| but I want us sitting as Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| to know that the Board of Education is interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| definitely in what's taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| in education here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| And then the second point that I want to make is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| I have attended several Board of Education meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| and if you say maybe Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| does not know much about what's taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| at the Board of Education meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| it may be that we individually need to attend a few more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| not on special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| or special occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| of a certain process or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| but having attended several of their meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| I can see the process by which I think they try to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| I disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| with some of their philosophies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| or methods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| but I believe I need to first try to understand them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| before I need to try to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| about what we need to do differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| So I encourage you before we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| the Board of Education that you go to some of their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| I just wanted to say thank you again to the teachers that came and spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| and to hopefully assure them also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| that this is a welcome place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| for you to come and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8269)|
| 2:17:52| as opposed to what I've witnessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| at several times at Board of Education meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| where teachers have spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| to Board members who have turned around in their seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| and made all kinds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| just negative impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| about what they're hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| from teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| obviously not listening to the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| That is incredible to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| absolutely incredible and abominable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| I'm looking forward to the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| in the Board of Education, but you will find this place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| this body, welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| and please come and inform us more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| Anything else on Mr. Suttles' discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8325)|
| 2:18:53| I can't read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| Discussion regarding the EIS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| Yes, Mr. Chairman, I believe that the representatives are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| If you all would come down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8345)|
| 2:19:08| I haven't talked with them, but I know that last night we had tornado warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| Our system went into effect about a month or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| I just wanted to get an update from them on how it performed last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| I have gotten some emails from folks who said it worked great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| Some people who said they signed up and didn't get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| I just wanted to ask Mr. Harnish how he felt things went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| If you've had a chance to check with your folks about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| see if there's any adjustments that we need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| Thank you, Commissioner. I have and we do need to make some adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| Like a number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| I got several notifications myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| at times more than I maybe really needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| In those circumstances, you always would prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| to get too many notifications and not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| Our system itself, though, did not push out any of those warnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8390)|
| 2:19:53| We had an Internet service provider outage at the 911 center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| so the software may have been working reasonably well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| but it was not connected to the outside world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| Since I've been here this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| I know the officials there have been working with the provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| to get that service restored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| and we've got time set aside later in the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| to find out how we can build in a certain amount of redundancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| so that a system that's that essential to public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| is not reliant on a single means to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| Explain to me again exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| I don't know exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| I do know that the system that Federal installed for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| is dependent on getting that information out over the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| If there is not an Internet connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8435)|
| 2:20:38| between the software and the computers there in the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| and the outside world, it may be a fairly easy matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8442)|
| 2:20:45| to put notifications into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| but then it doesn't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| I do know that Mr. Garrison at the Purchasing Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| contacted Federal and had them check the log| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| to see if any of our notifications went out last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| and Federal has said they did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| so we know we've got some work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| Okay, so I guess the notifications I got were through my cell phone provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| Yes, and I think the strength| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| and the weakness of the system is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| when it is possible to get notifications through other means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| it can create the illusion that everything is working just as it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| And I guess in the sense those notifications did get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| things did work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| But of course we have a system with some sophistication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| and a certain amount of investment by the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| that we're relying on to provide that information also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| So my commitment to you is we'll make sure it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| because while we have redundancy for weather-related events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| we could have an emergency of another nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| where those other systems are not functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| So what caused the systems not to function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| The internet service provider lost service to the 911 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8511)|
| 2:21:57| So did that affect just us, or were there other things that were affected by it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| I don't know is the honest answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| but my presumption is there were other applications in that center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| dependent on the internet as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| So we had a power outage. Was it Comcast or Charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| I don't know the provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| Okay, so do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| So the center's internet went out, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8539)|
| 2:22:22| Was it the center's EOC went out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| Yes, of course the center is provided with backups for certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| like electricity and water and so forth so that it can continue to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| The emergency radio system can continue to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| All that equipment has a number of backups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| but to my knowledge there is not a backup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8558)|
| 2:22:41| for the internet service itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| If that goes out, it's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| Okay, well if you would, can you report back to us next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| on what's being done to fix that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| I mean obviously we've spent a lot of money, effort, and time to get this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| but if it happens again and we can't push out any notifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| we have a system that's no good to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| So can you come back next month and say here's what's being done to fix it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| Because it needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| I'll be happy to, and I couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| I didn't know if you saw my light or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| You'll have to refresh my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| It was EAS, the emergency broadcast system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| Is that where it came from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| It went off one time in the middle of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8609)|
| 2:23:32| It sounded like a fire alarm in a building going off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| My phones went off too. I just assumed it was the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| That's why I was asking today because other people were telling me they didn't get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| And so now I know why, is that I was getting it through my cell phone provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| not the Knox County provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| So we had issues because the internet service was down, and we've got to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| My question is when you say that, if it goes out to an internet service provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| does that do any good for those of us, which is almost everybody these days, that has cell phones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8633)|
| 2:24:00| It seems like it would be better off going out through a cell phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| the different cell phone service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| because if you're not looking at your computer, you're not hooked up to the internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| you're not going to get the message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| The federal system uses the internet simply to push that information out through cell phones and other devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| So had that link working correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8659)|
| 2:24:22| you still would have gotten a notification on your cell phone along with the other notifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8662)|
| 2:24:27| The issue in this case is that one very necessary link in the system wasn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8667)|
| 2:24:34| Now, I made the same mistake Commissioner Hammond did because I was getting so many notifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| I assumed at least some of them were coming from the county system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| But, in fact, the National Weather Service has the ability, if it's weather related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| to push these notifications out and they go through the cell providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| I'll say whatever came across my phone, I got it about five minutes before the really bad weather hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8693)|
| 2:25:01| Now, we didn't maybe get hit as bad as some places because I live out in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8701)|
| 2:25:05| but I think I heard that the Pellissippi Cedar Bluff area had some damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8705)|
| 2:25:10| But, I mean, it was enough that I went outside and looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8710)|
| 2:25:15| and we were preparing to take cover somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| So, I mean, it worked for me, whatever it was that came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| because I wouldn't have noticed it otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| I think what we've been given is the gift to examine the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8725)|
| 2:25:30| and make sure that it's reliable before we have an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8730)|
| 2:25:33| that this is the only system that would get that warning out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8733)|
| 2:25:37| In this case, it was a weather related event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| The community was fortunate in that the Weather Service does have this ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8740)|
| 2:25:44| to get this kind of warning out, as do a lot of commercial applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8744)|
| 2:25:49| But one of the concerns about having the system was, what if it's not a weather event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| What if it's an incident such as the train wreck and evacuation in 2002?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8754)|
| 2:25:59| The Weather Service isn't going to be notifying the public of that kind of an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8759)|
| 2:26:03| So, I think we have an obligation to the public to make sure that the system is working reliably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8763)|
| 2:26:08| for all kinds of emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| Maybe the train won't knock out the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8772)|
| 2:26:14| Just one comment on that, Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| Probably, these are initiated through basically from NORAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8776)|
| 2:26:22| So, I got about six too, also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| But they all had different times on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| So, I'm assuming maybe that every time NORAD puts one out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| it kicks a button over here and tells your machine to send one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| That's why there are multiples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8797)|
| 2:26:38| But I'd rather get more than not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| I think most people would prefer to have too much information in this respect and not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| But they all had different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| I mean, you know, this to me is just a vulnerability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| We've spent a lot of time over the years, decades, dealing with electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| You know, so we have multiple fees into important installations like this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8820)|
| 2:27:06| You know, we really protect our fiber, backbone, Internet service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| I just think, you know, it's fairly new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| We're going to have to probably spend a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| Companies, entities are going to end up having to get multiple fees into a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| If we want 24-hour coverage, if we want to know that we know that we know it's going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8847)|
| 2:27:34| then that's going to be an infrastructure investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| The powers that be, you know, PBA or whoever, emergency preparedness folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| are going to have to probably take a hard look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8863)|
| 2:27:46| It will probably be a budgetary consideration as well going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| Chief Harness, will you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| Yes, of course. My name is Jerry Harness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| My address is 1339 Grenoble Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| Discussion regarding 2nd District School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| Commissioner Brolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| Yeah, we had talked about setting up a timetable last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| and I want to make sure that gets released publicly as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8895)|
| 2:28:22| Did you pick the night and the location for your forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| I'm getting final confirmation on that tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8907)|
| 2:28:28| So as soon as I get that, we can either send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| I'd like to go ahead and send out tomorrow morning that any interested individuals need to get their resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8910)|
| 2:28:37| and letter of interest in by noon on August 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| that we will be conducting interviews after a work session next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| and doing the appointment during the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| August 1st is just a couple of days away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| Well, it's Friday. Today's Monday. It's Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8931)|
| 2:28:54| And this is no big surprise to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| Everybody has known that this has been going on, so I feel like that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| and I actually discussed it with David Boock Friday about proper timetabling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8940)|
| 2:29:08| So – and I'm hoping to do the forum for the 2nd District either on the 12th or the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8948)|
| 2:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| So – but I'd like to go ahead and get as much information out as soon as possible about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8956)|
| 2:29:21| so that people know what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8961)|
| 2:29:24| Yeah, I think we need to get with Cliff Rogers, too, and set up a deadline for petition – candidate petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| Yeah, and that should probably be kept separate so that it's less confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| It is, but it's still something – because there's a – that's a September deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8977)|
| 2:29:38| Commissioner Rollenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| Do you think maybe if we gave them until the 8th, that would actually give them a few more days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8980)|
| 2:29:45| I know people just kind of knew it was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| What's the agenda deadline, Jolie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| The 4th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| The 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8995)|
| 2:29:56| The agenda deadline is the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| Let's do the Monday the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8997)|
| 2:29:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8998)|
| 2:29:59| Close of business on the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| On your judicial commissioner, it won't be vacant until the 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| So you may want to do that during the reorganization hearing when you have a final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9006)|
| 2:30:12| Have your applications in and then deal with it when you have a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| I don't think they wanted a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9016)|
| 2:30:17| I don't think they wanted to overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| You can't fill one until it's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| We'll talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9021)|
| 2:30:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9022)|
| 2:30:23| Commissioner Rollenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| Oh, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9025)|
| 2:30:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| Discussion regarding Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| I alluded to this a little bit last Monday at the workshop, but recently Mark Donaldson hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9036)|
| 2:30:47| without anybody's approval beforehand, Dave Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9047)|
| 2:30:54| who was let go when Madeline Rojero became our mayor of the city, unbeknownst to anybody beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9054)|
| 2:31:06| And from what I understand, got rid of the only tenured, supposedly, female in the office up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9066)|
| 2:31:19| To me, him hiring anybody is like Carcello hiring somebody to go be on the audit committee without coming through this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9079)|
| 2:31:30| The Metropolitan Planning Commission is supposed to be the ones that make the decisions on who's hired and who's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9090)|
| 2:31:37| And I would like to see us send a letter to them expressing our desire that they take their job seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9097)|
| 2:31:47| Because there's a lot of disgruntled folks over Donaldson's suggestions and whatever over the last couple, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9107)|
| 2:32:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9125)|
| 2:32:06| Me and you will draft a letter, and we'll see what commissioners want to sign off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9129)|
| 2:32:10| Is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| Did you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9134)|
| 2:32:15| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9135)|
| 2:32:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9136)|
| 2:32:17| I appreciate it, Superintendent Stank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9137)|
| 2:32:21| There's been a whole, whole lot of talk, I guess, in the first district, due to some advertising, whatever, about schools closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9141)|
| 2:32:33| First district schools closing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| So I just wanted to, before the superintendent got out, address that issue, because it is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9155)|
| 2:32:43| I'm getting a whole lot of concerned folks calling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| So I just want to ask the superintendent to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| I'm not going to be here long, but my question is, let's pick a time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9169)|
| 2:32:57| In your strategic plan, what is it, 20, what's your next plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| Within your 2020 strategic plan, are there plans to close down any schools within the first district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9184)|
| 2:33:12| Did you actually say it wasn't going to take very long, is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9192)|
| 2:33:16| Jim McIntyre, Superintendent of Schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9196)|
| 2:33:19| We have no plans to close schools in the first district, Commissioner, and we have no plans for the foreseeable future to close schools in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9199)|
| 2:33:27| So I really don't know where that came from or if it was just made up out of whole cloth, but that is not the reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9207)|
| 2:33:33| We are not contemplating closing any schools in the first district now or for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9213)|
| 2:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| Commissioner Smith, do you start that roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| Any other business to come before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| We are adjourned until 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9228)|
| 2:33:57| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9237)|
| 2:34:14| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| Commissioner Brawls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9258)|
| 2:34:19| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9259)|
| 2:34:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9260)|
| 2:34:21| Commissioner Ormby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9261)|
| 2:34:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9262)|
| 2:34:23| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9263)|
| 2:34:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9264)|
| 2:34:25| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9266)|
| 2:34:27| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9267)|
| 2:34:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9268)|
| 2:34:29| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9269)|
| 2:34:30| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9270)|
| 2:34:31| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9271)|
| 2:34:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| Commissioner Schaus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9273)|
| 2:34:34| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9274)|
| 2:34:35| All right, we've got ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9275)|
| 2:34:36| We'll go ahead and take the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| 5-H-14-RC is a request of volunteer development for rezoning from a agricultural to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9279)|
| 2:34:48| Property located southeast side of Westland Drive, southwest of Collier Lane in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9288)|
| 2:34:56| Is the applicant here, I assume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| I believe there's opposition in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9298)|
| 2:35:00| I've got one person signed up for public forum, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| I was asking if the last one, Phil Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9303)|
| 2:35:06| Yeah, let me, if you all, Commissioner, if you don't mind, Mr. Garrett, on the last item on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9306)|
| 2:35:15| without objection, wants to postpone at least 30 to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| Is there any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| Go ahead and cut him loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| 5-C-14-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| To the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| Next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| Now, for the folks that haven't been here before, what we'll do is we'll go ahead and have the applicant make a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9338)|
| 2:35:47| and then hopefully within a five-minute range, and then I'll have Mr. Long has signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9347)|
| 2:35:54| and then we'll go from there and kind of have a rebuttal, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| So that's kind of how that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| Go ahead, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9359)|
| 2:36:00| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9362)|
| 2:36:03| I'm John King, 620 Market Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9363)|
| 2:36:10| I'm here on behalf of the applicant, and I'm furiously sorting some material that I want to give to members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| and I'm going to yield at this time to the opposition, let them go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9375)|
| 2:36:21| I know that there is a lady here who has spoken before from the Bennington subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9381)|
| 2:36:28| I do not represent her, but I know she will want to be heard on the matter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9388)|
| 2:36:34| So I would hope that whoever's time is going to be charged with her will respect the fact that she does want to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9394)|
| 2:36:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| And that was kind of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9404)|
| 2:36:46| Are we going to track time here, or are you going to track it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9406)|
| 2:36:50| I've generally been tracking it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9410)|
| 2:36:55| Mr. Long, if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9415)|
| 2:37:03| Ebenezer is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| This is about Westland, and the lady is not here about Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| Go ahead, Mr. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9430)|
| 2:37:14| Chairman, members of the Commission, my name is Jason Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| I'm with the law firm of Lowe, Yeager & Brown, 900 South Gay Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9437)|
| 2:37:24| I appreciate Mr. King yielding the floor to me to speak in opposition to a matter that I think the Commission will probably have some questions for him on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9444)|
| 2:37:34| So to the extent that I have any time left over, I'd like to reserve it for a rebuttal opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9454)|
| 2:37:41| I represent in this matter the Gettysview Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9461)|
| 2:37:46| A number of members of that association are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9466)|
| 2:37:50| I'd like them to stand up briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9470)|
| 2:37:57| When we are here, I want to be clear not to oppose the development of this property located at Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9477)|
| 2:38:03| This is a good piece of property, and we understand that it is prime for development and probably should be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9483)|
| 2:38:09| Our concerns are threefold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| First, that that development not exacerbate already difficult traffic flow patterns on Westland Drive, which is a major thoroughfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9491)|
| 2:38:20| Second, to conserve or to the extent possible, minimize the impact of environmental concerns on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9500)|
| 2:38:27| where a number of heavily wooded trees and a spring and creek run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| And third, and probably most importantly, aside from the traffic concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| we're concerned about this development being in accord with the general character of the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9516)|
| 2:38:42| To give you an idea of what this property looks like, it is bounded on the west by the Gettysview subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9522)|
| 2:38:51| That is a piece of property that is developed at 2.29 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| To the north, it's bounded by Gettysview Golf Course, which is certainly developed at a much lower residential level than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9537)|
| 2:39:05| To the east, it's bounded by some single family residences on agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| We think that their development is at less than or around .22 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9551)|
| 2:39:16| If you want to go further east to the next subdivision, it's Rowfield subdivision, which is also built out at less than 3 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9556)|
| 2:39:25| And then finally, to the south, it's bounded by agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9565)|
| 2:39:29| And so our position in this matter is that this development should be at a level consistent with those surrounding neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9569)|
| 2:39:38| as charged to the commission in making zoning decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| We think it should be consistent with the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9581)|
| 2:39:46| At MPC, the recommendation was made for 3 units per acre this development to be built out at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9586)|
| 2:39:54| Now, 3 units per acre over the size of the entire property, 18.26 acres, would come to about 54 total units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9594)|
| 2:40:05| The problem that the homeowners association and the surrounding neighborhoods have is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| according to the plans of the developer, 4 acres of the property is not going to be developed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9610)|
| 2:40:16| There's a house that sits there. It's going to be left relatively untouched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| So we're really talking about developing on the back 14.26 acres of property, as near as we can tell from the developer's plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9620)|
| 2:40:29| If 54 homes were built on that 14.26 acres, you are essentially looking at building at over 3.8 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9629)|
| 2:40:42| which is far in excess of what MPC recommended and is, quite frankly, out of character with the surrounding neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9642)|
| 2:40:50| and would impinge upon those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| We would suggest that if the developer is only going to build on those back 14.25 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9653)|
| 2:40:59| that in order to meet MPC's recommendations of 3 units per acre and to be consistent with the surrounding neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9659)|
| 2:41:06| this commission should approve development at 2.4 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9666)|
| 2:41:11| I can do all the math for you. I was told as an attorney I wouldn't have to do a lot of math in my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9671)|
| 2:41:17| I've had to do a lot for this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| But suffice to say, if the 18.26 acres is taken as a whole and it's developed at 2.4 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9679)|
| 2:41:30| that effectively creates 3 units per acre on those back 14.25 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9690)|
| 2:41:36| which would be consistent and right up to the max of what the surrounding property has been developed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9696)|
| 2:41:43| In addition, the Homeowners Association, again recognizing that this is property that will be developed or should be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9703)|
| 2:41:51| has tried to reach out to the developer, has tried to make proposals that they believe would help ameliorate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9711)|
| 2:41:57| or bring the two parties together, in particular the creation of a buffer zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9717)|
| 2:42:02| the setting of deeper setback lines against the Westland property or against the Getty's View property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9722)|
| 2:42:12| to create a little bit of a buffer and a little bit of privacy for those individuals living along that side of the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9732)|
| 2:42:18| The developer was unable to exceed any of those requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9738)|
| 2:42:22| And so as a result, we're here asking commission that, yes, go ahead and approve the change in zoning of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9742)|
| 2:42:29| but do it in a manner that is consistent with the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| Do it at 2.4 units per acre so that that property can be built out and will fit in nicely with the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9753)|
| 2:42:40| It will also minimize the traffic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9760)|
| 2:42:43| As many of you, I'm sure, know, Westland Drive is a heavily traveled piece of roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9763)|
| 2:42:50| And, in fact, A.L. Lotz School is just down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| And during the school year, that traffic backs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9773)|
| 2:42:56| It backs up past A.L. Lotz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| It backs up past the Getty's View subdivision entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| It backs up as far as this property is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| And adding another 54 units or whatever the developer intends to build out at is only going to exacerbate that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9784)|
| 2:43:12| So we think a development at a lower level will help ameliorate those concerns and allow traffic to flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9792)|
| 2:43:19| Again, I'd like to reserve any time I might have for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9799)|
| 2:43:23| Quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| Are you representing Getty's View Way, that kind of street right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| It's the Getty's View Homeowners Association, which is on the west side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| Getty's View stretches across Westland Avenue, both into the golf course on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| The same HOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| To my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| I was just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| I was looking at the Getty's View Way, which is precisely adjacent, if I'm looking at it correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9822)|
| 2:43:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9828)|
| 2:43:49| That's the property that's adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9831)|
| 2:43:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9832)|
| 2:43:53| Jason, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| I'm trying to follow your math, what you're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9836)|
| 2:43:57| It's a little difficult to follow at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9837)|
| 2:43:58| You're saying 18.2 acres, and you speak about 14.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9838)|
| 2:44:02| So are you figuring you're 2.4 per acre on the 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9842)|
| 2:44:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9847)|
| 2:44:08| You can do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9848)|
| 2:44:09| You could say 2.4 on the 18 and a quarter acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| Because I come out with 43 units that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| Well, I came out and I rounded down to 42 units total would be built out on the back 14 and a quarter acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9854)|
| 2:44:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9862)|
| 2:44:23| But that's effectively three units per acre on that 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9863)|
| 2:44:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| Mr. Keene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9871)|
| 2:44:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9882)|
| 2:44:43| I'm going to ask that we put just for the record, John, just for the record, name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9883)|
| 2:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| Go ahead and start passing that out and embarrass around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| I'm going to ask that each of you are going to be getting a packet of material that relates to some of the subject matter in this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9893)|
| 2:45:01| I'm John Keene, 620 Market Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9901)|
| 2:45:10| When this matter was first up for consideration, there was a request for postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9910)|
| 2:45:15| so we could talk to some of the people who were opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9915)|
| 2:45:18| and those identified at the time to us were three property owners along the eastern boundary of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9918)|
| 2:45:27| If you turn in your packet of materials to the map, if you will, it shows the development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9927)|
| 2:45:36| I can talk briefly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| They were owners on Coyle Lane consisting of Dr. John Little and that family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9939)|
| 2:45:46| then a family named Green, and then another property owner named Ken Zell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9946)|
| 2:45:52| We met with them, had some negotiations back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9952)|
| 2:45:58| Ultimately what we did was-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| Excuse me, John, what page are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9960)|
| 2:46:04| I'm not on any of that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9964)|
| 2:46:07| But essentially what we did was worked out an arrangement with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| where they were able to get more buffer and satisfy their other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9971)|
| 2:46:17| They're represented by Mr. John Ballant, who's here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9977)|
| 2:46:21| and we spent a lot of time and effort and got things worked out with those individuals and property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9981)|
| 2:46:29| and they have no opposition and are not here to oppose us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9989)|
| 2:46:35| Subsequent to that, the representative of the group in Gettysview surfaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=9995)|
| 2:46:41| and we've had a meeting with them as well, and what they wanted is some of what you heard here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10001)|
| 2:46:49| They wanted us to, in essence, add to the rear yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10009)|
| 2:46:58| Instead of it being 35 feet, they wanted it to be 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| They wanted a 15-foot strip across the rear of our boundary to be left undisturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10021)|
| 2:47:08| and in addition to plant more trees of a specific type and size in addition to what was already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10028)|
| 2:47:15| and give them the opportunity to nurture those particular trees, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10035)|
| 2:47:22| And we couldn't agree to that because the property is such that in order to construct houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10042)|
| 2:47:29| you're going to get on there, and in all likelihood, most of the trees will need to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10049)|
| 2:47:36| Obviously, they'll go back in at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10056)|
| 2:47:41| In addition, they said absent that kind of an agreement or arrangement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10061)|
| 2:47:48| then they would be opposed to the density, and you've heard here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10068)|
| 2:47:53| that essentially what they're asking for you to approve is 2.4 units to the acre across the entirety of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10073)|
| 2:48:02| What we did in addition to making suitable arrangements with the people on the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10082)|
| 2:48:08| we also agreed with them, as they had requested and everybody had expressed interest in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10088)|
| 2:48:15| seeing to it that an existing house on the front corner of that property be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10095)|
| 2:48:22| It's a large house and to be retained with about a four-acre lot on which it sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10102)|
| 2:48:28| So we have done that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| What we're down to now is the request to make this development at 2.4 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10112)|
| 2:48:40| We can talk about built-outs, and I'll probably mention them somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| but Gettysview is zoned at one to four, one to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10123)|
| 2:48:51| We're asking that you approve 3.6 dwelling units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10131)|
| 2:48:57| and we have to have that in order to get in the number of lots now remaining after preserving these others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10137)|
| 2:49:06| as everybody wanted done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10146)|
| 2:49:08| We have to have that many in order to make this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| so we would ask that it be 3.6 dwelling units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10151)|
| 2:49:16| Otherwise, this proposal fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10156)|
| 2:49:20| If you look in what you've got, you'll have some aerial photos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10160)|
| 2:49:25| and as I said, Gettysview is zoned at up to four units to the acre, and we're asking for 3.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10165)|
| 2:49:36| In that same general area, you'll find on your map that's part of your materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10176)|
| 2:49:42| you'll find property at Rofield is at three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10182)|
| 2:49:49| and the next piece just to the west of the school that he just mentioned is likewise four units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10189)|
| 2:49:59| Across the street there on Westland is a development that is up to 4.5 dwelling units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10199)|
| 2:50:07| There are some five dwelling units to the acre likewise in the general area where this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10207)|
| 2:50:14| This piece of property is essentially flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10214)|
| 2:50:16| It has no slopes to contend with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10216)|
| 2:50:19| Gettysview had to contend with slopes and deal with trying to, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10219)|
| 2:50:24| modify their development or proposed development because of the existence of those slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10224)|
| 2:50:30| This is a flat piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10230)|
| 2:50:32| It has no slopes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10232)|
| 2:50:35| The consequence is generally is that in accordance with the hillside and slope protection policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10235)|
| 2:50:42| you try to do your more dense developments on flat property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10242)|
| 2:50:49| so that you don't have the pressure on the slope areas to do the more dense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10249)|
| 2:50:56| They sort of go in lockstep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10256)|
| 2:50:57| So we would ask again that you do this at 3.6 dwelling units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10257)|
| 2:51:04| As built out, if you wanted to talk about that, as my opponent has mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| there are some portions in Gettysview where the build out is at 5.48 dwelling units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10270)|
| 2:51:19| 3.94 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10279)|
| 2:51:22| Across Westland on the other side, there's one area that's 4.89 dwelling units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10282)|
| 2:51:29| Row Field, there are portions of it built out that are 3.85, 4.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10289)|
| 2:51:35| and one area where it's 5 dwelling units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| I think the significance is what the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| Gettysview is 1 to 4 dwelling units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| We're asking for 3.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10305)|
| 2:51:49| When we got up there, if you look at it, they wanted us to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| and leave vegetation along our rear boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10314)|
| 2:51:58| As you enter onto Gettysview Way, and this is set out on the maps and the material you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10318)|
| 2:52:06| and I believe there are descriptions along with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| but the first house on the left as you turn into Gettysview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10329)|
| 2:52:14| first house on the left back several years ago when that was being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10334)|
| 2:52:18| requested a variance to reduce the rear yard setback from 35 feet to 20 so as to build that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10338)|
| 2:52:27| There are some other properties in there that appear to perhaps encroach upon that 35-foot setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10347)|
| 2:52:33| but I cannot be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| I know in one instance at 1124 Gettysview Way, that property owner has in actuality put a fence around his backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10355)|
| 2:52:45| and unfortunately he has included a strip of our property within his fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10365)|
| 2:52:51| which he has also cleared to what he perceived to be his boundary, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10371)|
| 2:52:56| but he's into our property on one end 5 feet and on the other end 9 1⁄2 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10376)|
| 2:53:02| If you look at those aerials, I think you can see that when those other houses were built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10382)|
| 2:53:07| those lots were essentially clear-cut to the boundary line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10387)|
| 2:53:12| And then the house is built, and what they're asking in essence is we want, by virtue of now the density requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10392)|
| 2:53:22| in essence to require us to provide them a buffer when they decline to create a buffer for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10402)|
| 2:53:34| I think that there's one of those views that will show an area there in Gettysview cleared for the purposes of future development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10414)|
| 2:53:49| and you can see the practice there once again has been to essentially clear-cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10429)|
| 2:53:56| take down everything to the boundary lines, and then build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10436)|
| 2:54:02| We respectfully say that we have met the major interest of those that we could, and we did it in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10442)|
| 2:54:12| and they did it in good faith, and what we now have is a proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10452)|
| 2:54:19| that across the entirety of the property represents 3.6 dwelling units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10459)|
| 2:54:26| That is within the range of other zoning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10466)|
| 2:54:32| We will be building similar housing as to what currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10472)|
| 2:54:39| All of these will be single-family detached lots, and we have 58 in number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10479)|
| 2:54:45| We respectfully request that you approve that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10485)|
| 2:54:53| Recently, if you want to talk about Westland, it's essentially a three-lane street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10493)|
| 2:55:01| It's two lanes and a center turning lane, and I know that very recently this body approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10501)|
| 2:55:09| Excuse me. Excuse me. I beg. I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10509)|
| 2:55:14| Stand corrected. More out there than I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10514)|
| 2:55:19| I know that recently this body has approved, for example, on Nubbins Ridge Road, a curvy, hilly road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10519)|
| 2:55:27| 3.8 dwelling units to the acre at a piece of property that is essentially at the bottom of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10527)|
| 2:55:35| This one doesn't present that kind of challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| This one doesn't present that kind of problem, and we respectfully request approval of our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10538)|
| 2:55:46| It is correct that MPC approved at three dwelling units to the acre at the time we were requesting five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10546)|
| 2:55:57| We have since met with neighbors and done, as I say, spent time and energy in negotiating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10557)|
| 2:56:07| and as a consequence of all that, we have solved a major part of the issues, at least with one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10567)|
| 2:56:17| We can't really do anything with the other side, but as a consequence of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10577)|
| 2:56:22| we've reduced our request from five units to the acre to 3.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10582)|
| 2:56:35| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10595)|
| 2:56:36| I doubt that I have any time left, but I'll answer questions if anybody has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10596)|
| 2:56:42| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10602)|
| 2:56:43| This first house on the left, on the map, and this is the last one that you gave us on the very back sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10603)|
| 2:56:51| It's the large piece in the very last one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10611)|
| 2:56:56| There's two lines drawn there, and this is the one where you've drawn in is where the fence encroaches on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10616)|
| 2:57:04| and then there's also a line drawn through there in that first house on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10624)|
| 2:57:09| It looks like the corner of the house goes past this white line, and then there's another white line next to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10629)|
| 2:57:16| What do those two white lines represent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10636)|
| 2:57:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10639)|
| 2:57:20| The first one you come to immediately to the rear of that house is our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10640)|
| 2:57:28| You say it appears to go over that line, but in actuality that is a shadow of the house based on the angle from which the picture was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10648)|
| 2:57:37| but that is the house that requested a variance from the 35-foot setback to reduce it to 20, and that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10657)|
| 2:57:46| So that accommodated the building of his house closer to his rear boundary line, but he has not gone over that boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10666)|
| 2:57:56| The second boundary line is just another parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10676)|
| 2:58:00| As you move away from his house, the first line is the rear boundary of his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10680)|
| 2:58:06| and the western boundary of our property, and the second one is a parcel, but that parcel is included in our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10686)|
| 2:58:15| That's just a parcel line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| Were there any other along the road there, Getty's View Way, where you come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10697)|
| 2:58:22| were there any other homes that were less than the 35 feet that it called for that needed a variance or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10702)|
| 2:58:31| I'm told by an individual who supplied us some information from Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10711)|
| 2:58:39| that one other house appears from the KGIS map that it may be about five feet over the rear setback line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10719)|
| 2:58:49| but not caught by the inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| There has been no request for a variance on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10731)|
| 2:59:00| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| I don't have a question, Mr. King, but I would like to hear from MPC if it's zone one to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10742)|
| 2:59:07| I'd like their thought process behind asking or recommending the density up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10747)|
| 2:59:13| Can I add to that, if they're talking, just also what was the analysis of the traffic situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10753)|
| 2:59:20| and like Commissioner Hammond said, what was your reasoning on why this was three rather than two and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10760)|
| 2:59:26| or three and a half or five that they originally requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10766)|
| 2:59:32| We thought, the Buzz Johnson MPC staff, we thought the three was more compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10772)|
| 2:59:38| and consistent with the prevailing density pattern around this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10778)|
| 2:59:43| I mean, it ranges, if you look at your zoning map, it ranges from 1.4.5 all the way down to agricultural zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10783)|
| 2:59:54| which requires one acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| So there's a broad range of density within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10796)|
| 3:00:00| We thought the three was a good compatible kind of in the middle zone that would allow development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10800)|
| 3:00:08| that would continue to maintain the overall density pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| or at least be within that overall range of density within the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10812)|
| 3:00:17| At the meeting, I think everything from two up to what the applicant initially requested, five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10817)|
| 3:00:25| was kind of thrown around from all the people that presented testimony at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10825)|
| 3:00:30| and staff felt like three was the most appropriate density range for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10830)|
| 3:00:36| I've noticed, I'm looking at the CAGIS map here, and this is in the Getty's View property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10836)|
| 3:00:42| that's just to the west of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| And on the CAGIS map, it said it's zone PR at four units per acre, and that's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10844)|
| 3:00:52| And it looks like over on the west half of that part of the subdivision now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10852)|
| 3:00:57| not all the homes have been built, but it looks like it's pretty dense on that part adjacent to AL lot schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10857)|
| 3:01:05| And when we're talking about that, what did we say that one was built out at, at two point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| I don't know what it was built at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10871)|
| 3:01:14| I can't remember what they said that was built at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| but it looks like there's some pretty dense housing with pretty close to zero lot lines on the part adjacent to AL lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10876)|
| 3:01:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10885)|
| 3:01:34| It's a polo club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10894)|
| 3:01:37| That's not homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| Yeah, it's connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10899)|
| 3:01:40| It's attached homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10900)|
| 3:01:45| If I may, I think at least one, if you get past Getty's View way that runs through the next section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10905)|
| 3:01:53| which is, if you will, included in that area where the lots are very much smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10913)|
| 3:02:03| when the rest of that is finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10923)|
| 3:02:07| the build-out on that part of the Getty's View will exceed five dwelling units per acre as far as the build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10927)|
| 3:02:18| But now, overall, they've got to comply with the density which they have, which is one to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10938)|
| 3:02:28| But he mentioned build-outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10948)|
| 3:02:31| I really think that the issue and the proper question is what's it zoned for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10951)|
| 3:02:35| It's zoned for four, and we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10955)|
| 3:02:39| I failed to say that Mr. Valiant's here, and he's represented some people that were on the east side of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10959)|
| 3:02:47| and I've made representations about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10967)|
| 3:02:51| I hope I don't stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10971)|
| 3:02:54| I think he's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10974)|
| 3:02:56| I'll let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10976)|
| 3:02:57| Mr. King's a sergeant for the brigade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10977)|
| 3:03:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10985)|
| 3:03:08| He just advised that they're not in opposition on Coley Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10988)|
| 3:03:14| The opposition's from Getty's View side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| Commissioner McKenzie had a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11000)|
| 3:03:22| And I don't know who to address this to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11002)|
| 3:03:26| Mr. King brought up an interesting point, and that's so I'm assuming for this property here on Getty's View Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11006)|
| 3:03:36| that there was a setback that this first house asked for a variance on, but there was no buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11016)|
| 3:03:47| and maybe this is to buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| Maybe there was no requirement for a buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| and then I guess as a backup for this other part that's been clear cut here on Getty's View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11032)|
| 3:03:58| is there a buffer requirement on that particular piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| I know it's zoned one to four, but are there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11042)|
| 3:04:05| Because it sounds like they're imposing some or asking for some pretty strenuous buffer requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11045)|
| 3:04:14| but I don't, you know, with this property, are there any requirements there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11054)|
| 3:04:19| I can't speak to a buffer, but the setback, if it was varied, that would be what was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11059)|
| 3:04:25| the more narrow thing now as to whether or not in that setback a buffer was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11065)|
| 3:04:30| You've got kind of two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11070)|
| 3:04:32| Right, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11072)|
| 3:04:36| I can't speak to at this point if any buffering requirements were called for on that lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11076)|
| 3:04:42| or any of the lots in that portion of Getty's View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11082)|
| 3:04:48| I think the pictures would indicate there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| Yeah, it doesn't look like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| And I guess I'm just wondering about this other piece that's been cut here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11092)|
| 3:04:56| That's another problem just kind of laying in wait for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11096)|
| 3:05:02| On a land of Andalusia Way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11102)|
| 3:05:04| Is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11104)|
| 3:05:05| Well, this map here, the brown part's been clear cut there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11105)|
| 3:05:09| If they build that out completely, we're probably going to have similar arguments from neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11109)|
| 3:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11116)|
| 3:05:21| John, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| I just want to make sure that I don't get accused of something I'm not intending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11123)|
| 3:05:32| Maybe I didn't make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| This KGIS, you've referred to that brown field area that's obviously been clear cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11134)|
| 3:05:40| This was at a point in time when this was starting to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11140)|
| 3:05:44| Today it may look somewhat different than this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11144)|
| 3:05:48| but this is what, in essence, to go build that subdivision out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11148)|
| 3:05:53| That's what they did to get it prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11153)|
| 3:05:56| Today it may look somewhat different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| It may have some houses on it and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| Mr. Long, they have you by six minutes right now, so if you'll keep it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11165)|
| 3:06:11| I'll make it as quick as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11171)|
| 3:06:12| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11172)|
| 3:06:13| I wanted to clarify, first of all, for Commissioner Briggs, his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11173)|
| 3:06:17| The piece of property that I think you were looking at that is developed out at five units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11177)|
| 3:06:22| or somewhere in that neighborhood, that's actually the Polo Club development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11182)|
| 3:06:26| It's not part of Gettysview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11186)|
| 3:06:29| It was opposed by the Gettysview Homeowner Association at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11189)|
| 3:06:33| and they're attached residences, so it's a little bit different in character than what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11193)|
| 3:06:41| And further, it's my understanding, as I've been informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11201)|
| 3:06:44| that it's not fully built out now because they've had difficulties with that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11204)|
| 3:06:49| and it basically looks like a giant mudslide at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11209)|
| 3:06:54| We're simply asking this commission today to approve what MPC had recommended at the MPC level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11214)|
| 3:07:00| and that is three units per acre, recognizing that if you're only going to develop on the back 14 1⁄4 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11220)|
| 3:07:08| effectively you have to reduce that number so that you're not building quite as many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11228)|
| 3:07:13| The three units per acre would be if they were developing over the entire 18.26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11233)|
| 3:07:17| We're asking, since they're only developing over the back 14.26, to reduce that to 2.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11237)|
| 3:07:24| When you look at some of these other neighborhoods that are of higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11244)|
| 3:07:29| there are some natural buffers there that help minimize impact upon local neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11249)|
| 3:07:34| The Polo Club is a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11254)|
| 3:07:37| You've got one side, the school, so you really don't have buffer issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11257)|
| 3:07:41| in connection with other neighborhoods on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11261)|
| 3:07:44| And then you've got on the east side essentially a drop-off or a slope-off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140728?start=11264)|
