|  424.04 |  431.04 | All right. We'll have a report from our beer board inspector. Why are we here today, sir?                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=424.04)             |
|  431.04 |  437.04 | Yes, sir. On July 24, 2023, the Texas Knox County Sheriff's Office conducted an underage                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=431.04)             |
|  437.04 |  444.04 | beer buy, the 6400 Mandeville Pike. The arrestee failed to look at the underage person's ID                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=437.04)             |
|  444.04 |  451.04 | and sold him a three pack of Modelo. All right. And this is the third offense for this                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=444.04)             |
|  451.04 |  460.04 | business within the past 12 months? It's 12 months? Yeah. Right out of it. November 22,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=451.04)             |
|  460.04 |  468.04 | April 20? Yes, it is. Yeah. All right, sir. You've heard the report from the officer.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=460.04)             |
|  469.04 |  474.04 | Do you admit it or deny it? Yeah, I admit it. Admit it? Okay. What steps have you taken                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=469.04)             |
|  474.04 |  481.04 | to keep this from happening again? Actually, what happened is, what's happening to me is                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=474.04)             |
|  481.04 |  489.04 | between this two, second and third offense, I hired six people. Nobody wants to listen.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=481.04)             |
|  489.04 |  495.04 | That is the problem. And actually what happens is they do the scanning and everything in                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=489.04)             |
|  495.04 |  500.04 | front of me when I'm there. And when it's aligned and they see that he's old enough,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=495.04)             |
|  500.04 |  509.04 | tattoos, all that, oh, he's old enough. So I fired like five people in this four months.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=500.04)             |
|  509.04 |  516.04 | I'm struggling because of that. What I have decided is I'm going to put two employees.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=509.04)             |
|  516.04 |  525.04 | One is going to check just the ID. That's what I did now. So I think that should be,                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=516.04)             |
|  525.04 |  532.04 | you know, and I put signs over there. Spanish people, a lot of Spanish people, they come to me,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=525.04)             |
|  532.04 |  537.04 | they come at the store, so they don't understand English properly. So I've made, you know,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=532.04)             |
|  537.04 |  544.04 | in Spanish too. I mean, I don't know what should I do more and increase my own timings.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=537.04)             |
|  544.04 |  550.04 | I'm going to, I'm standing there more timely. The morning, we don't sell that much beer                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=544.04)             |
|  550.04 |  555.04 | and we have no problems in the mornings. Only the problem is in the evening time when it's a rush,                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=550.04)             |
|  555.04 |  560.04 | they get confused or something because they're alone. So I put one more people, one more cashier                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=555.04)             |
|  560.04 |  568.04 | with them. And now I hired one guy so that he's going to check the ID only.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=560.04)             |
|  568.04 |  578.04 | Chairman, turn it over to you. Thank you. I do notice you've had your permit since 2010                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=568.04)             |
|  578.04 |  583.04 | and did quite well until just this past year, it appears.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=578.04)             |
|  583.04 |  588.04 | Yeah, in 13, I'm running this store for 13 years, never had that problem.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=583.04)             |
|  588.04 |  594.04 | All right. And suddenly, I don't know why it's such a big deal. It's just, I mean, if a person is coming,                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=588.04)             |
|  594.04 |  598.04 | you can easily figure it out that yes, he's underage. And the reason why,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=594.04)             |
|  598.04 |  603.04 | what they are saying is the guy who came last time, he had a tattoo in his hand.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=598.04)             |
|  603.04 |  610.04 | So in Florida or somewhere, I don't know, it's illegal to have, you know, tattoos under 21.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=603.04)             |
|  610.04 |  613.04 | So that's what he was assuming. And that's what he was not even looking.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=610.04)             |
|  613.04 |  619.04 | He was just texting on his phone. Just not paying attention. Are there any comments?                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=613.04)             |
|  619.04 |  625.04 | And we have the scanning system. This is very easy. Can you please provide me the ID?                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=619.04)             |
|  625.04 |  631.04 | It's so easy, just have to scan it. I understand. I hear you.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=625.04)             |
|  631.04 |  638.04 | Does anyone have any comments? Commissioner Spoonmaker.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=631.04)             |
|  638.04 |  647.04 | Thank you, Madam Chair. Do your employees understand that if they sell beer to a minor,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=638.04)             |
|  647.04 |  655.04 | they're going to end up having to go to court? So that's what I was discussing with him.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=647.04)             |
|  655.04 |  659.04 | You know, that guy who sold to the minor, he didn't even told me.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=655.04)             |
|  659.04 |  663.04 | I got a phone call from the clerk office, Kathy.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=659.04)             |
|  663.04 |  667.04 | She called me and said, hey, you know that you have a meeting.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=663.04)             |
|  667.04 |  672.04 | I said, what kind of meeting you're talking about? You said you have a beer violation.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=667.04)             |
|  672.04 |  675.04 | I said, are you serious? That's what I was telling her.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=672.04)             |
|  675.04 |  681.04 | I have to ask three times. I asked her, is it true? Really?                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=675.04)             |
|  681.04 |  687.04 | I mean, I was so stunned at that time. And then when he went to the court,                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=681.04)             |
|  687.04 |  695.04 | then he came to me and showed me that the beer violation permit or whatever application has not been submitted at the court.                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=687.04)             |
|  695.04 |  700.04 | He texted me and I showed to him too. I mean, I have it on my phone.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=695.04)             |
|  700.04 |  708.04 | Court dismissed it. It's been dismissed. So he was saying that, see, I was telling you I did nothing wrong.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=700.04)             |
|  708.04 |  712.04 | And he got he quit the job before even telling me this thing has happened.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=708.04)             |
|  712.04 |  717.04 | He was blaming something else that I'm busy. I cannot work and all that.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=712.04)             |
|  717.04 |  724.04 | And he quit the job. And then when I got the phone call from her, I was like, really?                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=717.04)             |

|  988.04 |  991.04 | So I just want to make sure we reserve.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=988.04)             |

| 1022.04 | 1026.04 | I just want to echo Commissioner Jay's comments.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1022.0400000000001) |

| 1039.04 | 1041.04 | Thank you. Mr. Moyers.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1039.04)            |
| 1041.04 | 1049.04 | Thank you. I don't normally do this, but I just want to step in for a second.                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1041.04)            |
| 1049.04 | 1056.04 | There's a danger in not following these proposed schedules.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1049.04)            |
| 1056.04 | 1060.04 | It's the reason we put it in place in the beginning.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1056.04)            |
| 1060.04 | 1071.04 | Many, many years ago when I was a young lawyer, we had rules regarding how close you had to be to various kinds of establishments           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1060.04)            |
| 1071.04 | 1073.04 | if you were going to sell beer.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1071.04)            |
| 1074.04 | 1078.04 | from enforcing them because we weren't doing them evenly.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1074.04)            |
| 1078.04 | 1084.04 | Some places we'd waive it, some places we would make them meet the requirements,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1078.04)            |
| 1084.04 | 1088.04 | and eventually we told somebody they couldn't open up and they took us to federal court                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1084.04)            |
| 1088.04 | 1094.04 | and the federal court permanently enjoined us from enforcing them because of disparate enforcement.                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1088.04)            |
| 1094.04 | 1104.04 | So while you do have discretion, I think that unless there's something really that stands out about this,                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1094.04)            |
| 1104.04 | 1109.04 | it is somewhat dangerous to start putting down penalties ad hoc                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1104.04)            |
| 1109.04 | 1118.04 | because if we do that too much, it can have the effect of a finding of disparate treatment                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1109.04)            |
| 1118.04 | 1123.04 | and then we may lose some of our ability to have discretion in those cases where we need it.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1118.04)            |
| 1123.04 | 1131.04 | So just wanted to point that out, that there's a reason these things are in place.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1123.04)            |

| 1135.04 | 1140.04 | I agree to a point with what Commissioner Jay has said,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1135.04)            |
| 1141.04 | 1149.04 | and we have given some businesses latitude when they've had violations over multiple years.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1141.04)            |

| 1157.04 | 1163.04 | The danger is not to him, the danger is to the community                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1157.04)            |
| 1163.04 | 1170.04 | because they've only caught the three people this year that they've sold beer to minors.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1163.04)            |

| 1222.04 | 1223.04 | I'm sorry?                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1222.04)            |
| 1223.04 | 1224.04 | Do you have a comment?                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1223.04)            |
| 1224.04 | 1228.04 | Yeah, actually what I'm saying is I hired the people.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1224.04)            |
| 1228.04 | 1231.04 | I mean he was a part-timer.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1228.04)            |
| 1231.04 | 1233.04 | I'm working all the time.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1231.04)            |
| 1233.04 | 1239.04 | So what's happening is only three days he was here, three days, five to ten.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1233.04)            |
| 1239.04 | 1240.04 | That was his timings.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1239.04)            |
| 1240.04 | 1244.04 | The rest of the timings, I am there and the morning lady, she is there.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1240.04)            |
| 1245.04 | 1249.04 | And he was just hired a month ago.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1245.04)            |
| 1249.04 | 1252.04 | So do I hear you say you work the business full-time?                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1249.04)            |
| 1252.04 | 1258.04 | Yes, I'm working at the cash register and 100% nobody can get from me, no way.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1252.04)            |
| 1258.04 | 1261.04 | Even I know people I refuse so many times.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1258.04)            |
| 1261.04 | 1263.04 | I respect whatever he's saying.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1261.04)            |
| 1263.04 | 1265.04 | I agree with him too.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1263.04)            |
| 1265.04 | 1270.04 | I mean but look at my 13 years, never had any problems.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1265.04)            |
| 1270.04 | 1272.04 | Don't look at the one year.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1270.04)            |

| 1274.04 | 1275.04 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1274.04)            |

| 1278.04 | 1281.04 | We have a motion on the floor.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1278.04)            |

| 1283.04 | 1285.04 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1283.04)            |
| 1285.04 | 1290.04 | To our chair's office, you often are able to sort of put context around the                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1285.04)            |
| 1290.04 | 1296.04 | violations that you bring to us.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1290.04)            |
| 1296.04 | 1299.04 | We have received complaints on this business.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1296.04)            |
| 1299.04 | 1305.04 | It was a specific employee about probably a year and a half ago.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1299.04)            |
| 1305.04 | 1312.04 | We were unable to get that employee to do what they said was being done.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1305.04)            |
| 1312.04 | 1316.04 | So you had prior checks that they checked fine on?                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1312.04)            |
| 1316.04 | 1317.04 | Correct, yeah.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1316.04)            |
| 1317.04 | 1322.04 | And I would say 95% of the businesses in Knox County get checked every other                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1317.04)            |
| 1322.04 | 1326.04 | month at least because we get out there and we hit it pretty hard.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1322.04)            |
| 1326.04 | 1331.04 | I send you guys the lists every month when we go out.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1326.04)            |
| 1331.04 | 1337.04 | You know, it is disheartening to see three in one year.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1331.04)            |
| 1337.04 | 1341.04 | I can look and see if it was the same employees, different employees.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1337.04)            |
| 1341.04 | 1344.04 | They checked the IDs or they didn't check the IDs.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1341.04)            |
| 1344.04 | 1349.04 | But this business had been on our radar prior to November.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1344.04)            |

| 1847.04 | 1850.04 | Mr. Hunt and I both met with him.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1847.04)            |
| 1850.04 | 1858.04 | He was immediately suspended from Easy Stop when we learned of this violation.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1850.04)            |
| 1858.04 | 1869.04 | His comment was that he misread the identification, put it into the system, entered it manually, and made the transaction.                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1858.04)            |
| 1869.04 | 1879.04 | He, as recently as May 11th of 2023, so roughly two months before this incident,                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1869.04)            |
| 1879.04 | 1884.04 | he had completed responsible alcohol sale training and has a certificate for that.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1879.04)            |
| 1884.04 | 1892.04 | Easy Stop has a procedure in place where its employees who conduct both beer and tobacco sales                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1884.04)            |
| 1892.04 | 1897.04 | must go into their online system and acknowledge, review,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1892.04)            |
| 1897.04 | 1907.04 | and understanding of company policy rules and regulations regarding alcohol sales, tobacco sales.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1897.04)            |
| 1907.04 | 1911.04 | Mr. Gonzalez, the employee, had done that in July.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1907.04)            |
| 1911.04 | 1916.04 | That's required to be completed within the first six days of each month,                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1911.04)            |
| 1916.04 | 1919.04 | and then that's uploaded into Easy Stop's system.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1916.04)            |
| 1919.04 | 1922.04 | Not only does the employee sign that they got the policy,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1919.04)            |
| 1922.04 | 1929.04 | but they also have to initial acknowledgment that they're not to sell alcohol to minors,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1922.04)            |
| 1929.04 | 1933.04 | that they are supposed to check the ID and that sort of thing.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1929.04)            |
| 1933.04 | 1940.04 | They also acknowledge that Easy Stop has a third-party mystery shopper program,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1933.04)            |
| 1940.04 | 1943.04 | and this is not Easy Stop employees going in.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1940.04)            |
| 1943.04 | 1948.04 | This is a program that they pay for, and any number of things are checked on those visits,                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1943.04)            |
| 1948.04 | 1954.04 | including the procedure for checking IDs to prevent sale of alcohol to minors.                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1948.04)            |
| 1954.04 | 1964.04 | So this location that we're here talking about had been checked each month from July of 2022 to present.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1954.04)            |
| 1965.04 | 1973.04 | I think it's important to point out that in both May of 2023 and June of 2023,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1965.04)            |
| 1973.04 | 1977.04 | the third-party mystery shopper, when they checked this location,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1973.04)            |
| 1977.04 | 1985.04 | it was actually this employee that was checked, the employee that mis-entered the ID.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1977.04)            |
| 1985.04 | 1989.04 | The mystery shopper program checks about 20 things,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1985.04)            |
| 1989.04 | 1996.04 | and on both occasions, they found no violations by this employee when they checked at this location.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1989.04)            |
| 1996.04 | 2002.04 | So there are a number of policies and procedures that Easy Stop has in place for this location                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=1996.04)            |
| 2002.04 | 2005.04 | and their locations throughout East Tennessee.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2002.04)            |
| 2005.04 | 2008.04 | As you can see, this was their first offense,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2005.04)            |
| 2008.04 | 2015.04 | and certainly happy to answer any questions that you all have, either for me or for Mr. Hunt.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2008.04)            |
| 2015.04 | 2019.04 | And we also have three other employees of the organization here who,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2015.04)            |
| 2019.04 | 2026.04 | if there's something you all ask that Mr. Hunt doesn't know, somebody else may be able to provide that answer.                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2019.04)            |
| 2026.04 | 2029.04 | All right. Thank you.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2026.04)            |
| 2029.04 | 2031.04 | Mr. Schoonmaker.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2029.04)            |
| 2031.04 | 2042.04 | Madam Chair, are the Easy Stop employees familiar that the state of Tennessee has made checking an ID a no-brainer?                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2031.04)            |
| 2042.04 | 2048.04 | In other words, your driver's license, if both of you gentlemen pull it out, it looks like this.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2042.04)            |
| 2048.04 | 2051.04 | If you're under 21, it looks like this.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2048.04)            |
| 2051.04 | 2055.04 | So the state has made it idiot-proof.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2051.04)            |
| 2055.04 | 2061.04 | So do the Easy Stop employees understand that when they're looking at an ID, if it looks like this,                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2055.04)            |
| 2061.04 | 2065.04 | you tell them to put the beer back in the cooler and leave the store?                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2061.04)            |
| 2065.04 | 2067.04 | That's correct, Mr. Schoonmaker.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2065.04)            |
| 2067.04 | 2073.04 | We also typically require, we had previously asked,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2067.04)            |
| 2073.04 | 2082.04 | we will require in the future the employees to take the driver's license from the purchaser, potential purchaser,                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2073.04)            |
| 2082.04 | 2084.04 | and scan it through the system.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2082.04)            |
| 2084.04 | 2090.04 | Those capabilities were present when Lucillo made the sale, but he did not scan the card,                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2084.04)            |
| 2090.04 | 2094.04 | which would have told him, you know, underage, don't make the sale.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2090.04)            |
| 2094.04 | 2098.04 | The register system verifies the age for the employee.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2094.04)            |
| 2098.04 | 2106.04 | There is pushback from our customers to not give the driver's license to our employees                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2098.04)            |

| 2254.04 | 2260.04 | The law director says that we're able to make the motion to approve the permit within 15 days.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2254.04)            |
| 2261.04 | 2267.04 | The state should do their inspection within that amount of time.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2261.04)            |
| 2267.04 | 2270.04 | If they don't, the beer permit's approved and we're done with it.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2267.04)            |
| 2270.04 | 2272.04 | So really there's no issue now.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2270.04)            |
| 2272.04 | 2273.04 | All right.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2272.04)            |
| 2273.04 | 2275.04 | Wonderful.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2273.04)            |
| 2275.04 | 2278.04 | Are there any other comments, questions?                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2275.04)            |
| 2278.04 | 2281.04 | I'd like to just make a brief announcement.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2278.04)            |
| 2281.04 | 2285.04 | If you all will remember, tomorrow we have two meetings.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2281.04)            |
| 2285.04 | 2292.04 | We have one at 2.30, the telecom meeting, which I promise you will be very short.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2285.04)            |
| 2292.04 | 2297.04 | And then at 3 o'clock we actually have a special called beer board meeting.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2292.04)            |
| 2297.04 | 2303.04 | And there will be attorneys and I'd say lots of evidence present.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2297.04)            |
| 2303.04 | 2311.04 | So I cannot guarantee that will be a speedy hearing.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2303.04)            |
| 2311.04 | 2314.04 | Seeing no other lights.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2311.04)            |
| 2315.04 | 2316.04 | Motion to adjourn.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2315.04)            |
| 2316.04 | 2317.04 | We are adjourned.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230821-beer-board?start=2316.04)            |
