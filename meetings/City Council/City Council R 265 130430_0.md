| 0:01:41| and so we would like to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=101)|

| 0:02:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| The ayes haven't and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| The Mayor's Report, we're going to start with the Annual Report on Historic Preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| And the Historic Preservation Coordinator, what is your title, Kay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| Historic Preservation Planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| Kay Graybeal is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll answer to any of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| Kay Graybeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| I work with the Metropolitan Planning Commission here at the City-County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| Do you need my home address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| I just wanted to take a quick 60-second rundown of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| You have a hard copy there at each of your places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| The city's charter, as amended in 2002, requires that the annual report on the state of preservation within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| be reviewed by the NPC and presented to the Mayor of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| So I just wanted to start out by saying that next month is National Historic Preservation Month, the month of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| And within your report, you'll find a sheet of Knox Heritage-sponsored events to celebrate that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| And Kim may be here in the next minute or so to go over some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| But if not, you've got them there in your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Last calendar year was a very busy year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| There were 120 certificates of appropriateness reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| This number indicates there's been a steady, albeit small, increase over the last three calendar years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| It underscores the renovation industry's economic recovery in Knoxville during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| And I'll just take about 60 seconds to quickly hit some of the highlights in preservation that occurred over the last calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| First, we have the Walker-Sherrill House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| This house, as you know, was purchased by owner-developer Bill Hodges and his daughter Katie Hodges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| It's located at 9320 Kingston Pike, and it's one of the last really intact examples of antebellum houses in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| And the overlay boundaries were reduced so that it was more feasible to restore it and adaptively reuse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| Our next highlight is the Homemakers Program project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| This project is sponsored through the Community Development Department of the city, and this property is in 4th and Gill at 611 Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=272)|
| 0:04:40| And the bid was awarded to Jonathan and Cheryl Ball and Bentley and Jessica Brackett of Oak Valley Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| And the group has restored the formerly multi-unit house to a beautiful, single-family, energy-efficient home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=286)|
| 0:04:55| Next, we have a more unusual type of designation, and that is the city's first historic sign designation, the J.F.G. Coffee sign, thanks to Riley Foods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=295)|
| 0:05:06| the owner of the 1950s landmark sign, and Corbella Shriners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| Riley Foods secured an alternate location south of the Gay Street Bridge for the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| and it was approved as the city's first historic sign designation with a switch flipped on on Booms Day, September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| Also in September, Gay Street was recognized with a national award from the American Planning Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=324)|
| 0:05:32| and it was recognized in part due to preservation efforts and the street's continuous contribution to Knoxville's economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| The application itself was a collaboration among MPC staff and various city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| The effort was led by MPC planner Mike Carberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| And lastly, we have a highlight of Westwood, which is also known as the former home of John and Adelia Armstrong Lutz, built in 1890 at 3425 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=349)|
| 0:06:07| Knox Heritage received a gift from the Aslan Foundation in September toward capital it must raise to reach its goal of establishing a regional center for historic preservation at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=367)|
| 0:06:18| Knox Heritage plans to apply for historic overlay zoning for the house later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| The next slide just sort of highlights some of the events that Knox Heritage has planned for the month of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=384)|
| 0:06:32| and you also have that as a printout on your green sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| And there are also extra copies in the back of the room on the benches for any member of the general public that would like to take one with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=396)|
| 0:06:46| Thank you, Ms. Graybiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Are there any questions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| I would just like to draw your attention to the recommendations at the very end of the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| which the commission and the neighborhood groups, what I'm hearing is that they would like to see some resources put towards consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=416)|
| 0:07:04| and efficient compliance strategies, both proactive awareness-heightening education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| but also if there are any staff resources that could be dedicated to more of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| so that the compliance and enforcement is equitable among the neighborhoods and throughout each individual neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=437)|
| 0:07:27| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Thank you, Kay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| I appreciate the report, and I always look forward to it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| I'm just curious, that detail on the right side of the screen, where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| That's in the old city on Jackson Avenue on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| I can't remember the street number, but the northeast side of Jackson and Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| And it's at street level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| So it's a fire street or somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| Oh, no, it's on the other side of the street from Fire Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| All right, I'll look for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| I'll send you the information about where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Kay, I just wanted to thank you and the staff and the team that you've assembled, the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| You're doing a great job, and our history is precious to us, and we're glad to see some important structures saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=497)|
| 0:08:24| I had the pleasure this weekend of going to that 611 Gill House, the one that was purchased by the Beals and their partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=504)|
| 0:08:33| and it's a beautiful home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| And for years you'd ride by it and think the wrecking ball is coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| because it looked worse and worse after the fire and the windows were broken and boarded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| And now it's a lovely home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| So these things can be saved and they can contribute to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| A lot of credit goes to the Community Development Department's Homemaker Program, City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| for supporting that program, as well as the private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| Whatever tools we can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Whatever tools we can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| But it is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| Kay, I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| I see it's one of the recommendations is to establish funds sufficient to alleviate the demolition by neglect status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| of at least one significant building annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Do you all have a figure for that amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| Well, we started out with 100,000, which did help us a lot with the Knoxville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=558)|
| 0:09:26| Actually, since that is the first year that the demo by neglect ordinance has been implemented, at least to that degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| I think preservationists were thrilled to get that, if we could at least maintain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| But since we've seen that that was to some degree successful, it would be great to have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| But, no, I haven't collaborated with other groups on how much they think it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| I'll just remind council, currently we do have another $100,000 in the proposed budget for the coming year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| to continue that demolition by neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| So we will see how that works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| But, yes, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Are there other questions or anything else, Kay, that you wanted to mention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| I look forward to reading this in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| To continue on with the mayor's report, I wanted to just remind everybody that the IBM Smarter Cities team is in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=613)|
| 0:10:24| We won that grant valued at $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| We're one of 100 cities in the world that are receiving this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| It's a three-year program of IBM, and this is the third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| And so we have a team of five individuals, IBM professionals, who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| They started meeting with folks actually yesterday, and I met with them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| We had a press conference earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| So they're here for three weeks to help analyze and recommend ways for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| and its partners to reduce residential emergency utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| You know, those who end up needing assistance every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| how do we instead of just as a community paying for utility bills each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| can we instead link them up with weatherization and energy-efficient services and education that we know exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| So instead of putting a Band-Aid on each year, we're actually solving the bigger problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| There are a lot of issues related to it and a lot of players and different pots of money and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| So they have already started working on this, and for three weeks they will be working intently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| They'll be away from their families for those three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| working with us as a community to try and solve that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| So if you see them out and about, please tell them thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| On Saturday, the Parks and Recreation Department will hold its annual Let's Move! event at Victor Ash Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| and at Holston-Chilhowee Ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Both are from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| And, you know, the city has been recognized nationally for its rankings in this Let's Move! program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| and even the First Lady recently sent us a letter congratulating us on our gold status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| So we encourage everybody to come out and to help the kids move a little bit this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| This is part of a focus in our community to lower child obesity rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| And then last but not least, you all counsel would have gotten, and we sent out a press release today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| that our Deputy to the Mayor and Chief Operating Officer, Eddie Maness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| has decided to leave the city because, as you all know, he is the owner of Prestige Cleaners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| and he's got some expansion goals right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| They're expanding rapidly and that needs his full-time attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Plus, he wants to continue to build Honor Air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| We just had the Honor Air send-off last week, which was an unbelievable experience for me just to be there to see them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| So we regret very much to lose Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| He has been a great addition, and I consider this the first of many accolades over the next month that he is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| Different opportunities we'll have to shower praise upon him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| It's been about a year and a half, a little less than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| although he actually started working, I think, a month before we got sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| He started hitting the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| And I appreciate so much the work that Eddie has done with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| I know Bill, as Deputy to the Mayor, and both and all of us in our leadership team and staff who've worked with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| have appreciated the skills and the commitment, the passion he's brought to the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| So we will miss him, but he's going to continue as a special advisor, senior advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| So at no pay, by the way, somebody's already asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| We're not paying him, but this is, again, a part of his service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| He is going to be available to us, and so I really do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| And I'm also proud to announce that Ms. Christy Branscom, who has been our Senior Director of Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=841)|
| 0:14:09| she will be moving into the COO and Deputy to the Mayor position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| And, obviously, in that job, Christy worked closely with Eddie, reported to Eddie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| and, you know, has been with the city close to a year and a half now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| knows our operations, and has handled quite a big operation herself as public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| So I am very pleased that she is interested in moving up to that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| and look forward to working with her in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| I know you all joined me in congratulating Christy in the new position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| and thanking Eddie for the great job he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| But he'll be with us for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| And we talked about at dinner tonight just how much he's going to miss these Tuesday night meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=886)|
| 0:14:55| So Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| I just want to say, Eddie, I really appreciate the working relationship that we've had as far as a council person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| and you as deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| And I want to thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| In fact, I want to applaud Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=905)|
| 0:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Well, like I said, we'll have more opportunities to show our thanks to Eddie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| but we did make that announcement today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| So we'll start moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| I think that is all that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| So council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| Vice Mayor Kavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| I just wanted to announce the festival will be May the 11th, Saturday, May the 11th, from 11 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=934)|
| 0:15:44| It's being held, as always, at the Candora Building, which is a 681 Maryville Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| It's a really great event if you've never been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| It attracts several hundred people there during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| Like I said before, it's from 11 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| It's got live music, kids' activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| It's family-friendly, food, craft vendors of all type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| And it's just generally a really festive day in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| So I hope folks can come over and spend the afternoon in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| perhaps take dinner in after lunch with some of the vendors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| And, yes, Councilman Dellavope, South Knoxville is open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| We just follow the JFG sign and we'll get there at night if we come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| It will shine right on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| I just want to announce that the assigned task force public meeting is tomorrow night, 530, at the O'Connor Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| And we encourage all those folks to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| I encourage my colleagues to be there to listen also to the public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| That will be tomorrow night at 530 at the O'Connor Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Councilman Dellavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Let me footnote his comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| I hope that the businesses out there attend those meetings and try to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| because signs are important to you and anti-clutter is important to the rest of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| in terms of making our city more habitable and more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| But we have to work together, and we hope you'll look at these proposed rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| and get your input in now while they're still being formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| One more thing I want to announce or just tell people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| This is the month of April, I guess, is Jazz Appreciation Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| And so cities across the country are actually celebrating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| And today we had, if you were on the first floor of the city county building just about lunchtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| Kelly Jolly and Will Boyd, her husband, and their band played unbelievably beautiful jazz music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| for anybody who happened to be in the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| And we proclaimed it Jazz Day and Jazz Appreciation Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| So I encourage everybody to go out and listen to the jazz music that we have in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| We actually have a very talented community of jazz musicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| 8A is a resolution expressing support for the mayor's appointment of Terry Carruthers, Donna Downen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| Bill Hutton, and Bobby Braley, and reappointment of Lauren Ryder to the Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1097)|

| 0:18:25| We have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Also, I'd like to ask, I know that Terry Carruthers, Donna Downen, and Bobby Braley are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1106)|

| 0:20:53| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision to approve a use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| for a duplex in existing R1 low-density residential district property located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| on the southwest side of Clover Road northwest of Bradshaw Garden Drive, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| We have some people to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Right, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| We'll wait on any motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| We do have two people that are signed up to speak for the approval of the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| and that is Lynn Redman and Clark Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Now, is there somebody here opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| So the way we do it, ma'am, is first the folks who have filed the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| they will have up to three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| They've got two signed up, up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| And then they'll sit down and then you have up to five minutes per speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| up to three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| And then they get a chance for a two-minute rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| and then they'll be open to council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| So, Mr. Redman, let me get my timer out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| You know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Mayor, members of council, my name is Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| and I'm here tonight representing the Norwood Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| To give you a little background on this, this has been an illegal duplex for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| There was apparently a fire in the duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| and in the process of getting building permits to get it repaired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| the city said, well, it's not a legal use for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| You're going to have to get it rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| or you're going to have to quit using it as a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| So that's really why we're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| Our homeowners association asks that you approve this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| and deny the rezoning of this property into a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| Many different reasons for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| I think I've sent many members of council a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| but when it was at the MPC level, it, of course, was approved by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| but it was approved over a very strong staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| one of the strongest that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| In 2008, at the other end of Clover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| there was another duplex constructed illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| They wound up before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Dick Graff, who was on MPC during that meeting, said, stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| I drove out there last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| There is no reason to rezone this and allow a duplex in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| even though the builder had invested a great amount of money changing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| and he was actually doing a fourplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| So it was defeated at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| There is a track record before in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| There are several reasons that we object to that we mentioned in our letter to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| We feel that this is not in the spirit and violates the zoning regulations, Article I, Section 3, Article 1, Section 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1422)|
| 0:23:51| Section 3 says it's the duty of council to maintain and stabilize the value of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| We think that putting a duplex in the middle of a very large R1 area will tend to destabilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| Instead of raising just a straw man, let me give you a concrete example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| The side road near this property is called Clover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| There's a vacant house right now in which a family lived for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| They took their garage, they remodeled it into a separate residence for, I believe it was the wife's mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1456)|
| 0:24:24| She passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| The family has gone on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| And a bank has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| A realtor was talking to neighbors on Clover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| He said, would anyone object if I flipped this commercial and turned it into a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| So it's a fragile neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| It's a strong neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| It's got potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| We want to keep the potential that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| The other thing in Section 4, no building should be erected nor shall any building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| or premises be used other than what is permitted in the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| For council to operate as a favor machine and say, well, it's already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| Let's just, you know, make everything all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| I guess the worst things that have been done in the past in this city haven't been done by evil people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| It was someone that needed a favor and it didn't hurt too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| And pretty soon you flip the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| We don't want to be the neighborhood that gets flipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| I have given you a petition to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| It contains 20-some names of residents on Clover, Whitlow, Breton, the streets around there, who are opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1526)|
| 0:25:36| So it's not just our homeowners association, which covers a much greater area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| We would ask you tonight to vote for our appeal, keep our neighborhood strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| And, again, it's got a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| This is an older neighborhood from the 50s and 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| The original owners are transitioning out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| New families are moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| There's a lot of starter houses where people have taken older houses and remodeled them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| Let's continue that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Let's don't punch this hole in the middle of our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Thank you, Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| And Mr. Clark Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| I'm Clark Hamilton, 1200 Stilwell Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| I live at the corner of Clover and Stilwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| I have brought some neighbors who are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| I solicited the petition of those individuals from the Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| I have neighbors from Breton, Stilwell, Clover, and Whitlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| Will you please stand and pose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1598)|
| 0:26:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Thank you, Mr. Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| And now those who are here to speak against the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| Ma'am, if you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| And I'll start the timer here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| My name is Rikki Ballinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| I live at 2408 Brighton Farms Boulevard, and I'm the owner of the duplex at 5009 and 5007 Clover Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| I purchased the duplex through a commercial real estate company, Sutherland Realty, in April 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| After the fire that occurred in October 2012, I began to rebuild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| I wasn't made aware of the zoning issue until my contractor was notified in the process of getting permits for reconstruction in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1644)|
| 0:27:32| Upon purchasing this duplex, I had no reason to question that it was improperly zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| The city and county categorized the property as commercial per my tax statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| Online records show past owners have also paid the property taxes as a commercial classification at least the past 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1662)|
| 0:27:50| And the reason I say 11 years is that's as far as online records go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| The units have separate utilities for phone, cable, water, and electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| A certified address also exists where mail is delivered to the two separate addresses, 5009 and 5007 Clover Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| Mr. Redman states that his reason for appealing is the decision goes against a recommendation to deny the request by the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1687)|
| 0:28:15| The staff recommendation was erroneous as the employee was under the assumption that the request was to convert a single family home to a multifamily duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1695)|
| 0:28:25| File number 3A13UR, staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| The approval of this request would result in the conversion of the existing detached dwelling on this site to a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| During the MPC use on review meeting on March 14th, the commissioners were made aware of this error and understood that the duplex has always been the only existing structure on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1716)|
| 0:28:47| The property has never been a single family home since it was built in the early 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| This community currently has two apartment complexes within one mile of my duplex and Mr. Redman's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| Norwood Manor Apartments is located .52 miles from my duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| Tillery Ridge Apartments are located .72 miles from my duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| I'm not asking to build an apartment complex, nor am I asking to make any changes to the property as it was before the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| I have simply restored the duplex to its previous habitable state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| And actually I would say that I've increased the property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| I've done things that didn't have to be done, improved the outside that wasn't affected by the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| Brand new deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I pride myself as a landlord, always abiding to the local, state, and federal laws and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| I would never intentionally violate any law on purpose, nor do I allow my tenants to partake in any unlawfulness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| I specifically rent to all of my tenants on a month-to-month basis solely to protect myself and the neighbors of any potential issues that may arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1782)|
| 0:29:51| I have neighbors that live next door and across the street from my duplex that are here with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| Mr. and Mrs. Thomas have lived at 5005 Clover Road since 1972, right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1797)|
| 0:30:06| Peggy Curd lives at 5004 Clover Road, directly across the street from my residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1806)|
| 0:30:15| All are here in support of upholding the MPC's decision to approve the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| allowing the duplex to remain as it always has been, a multifamily home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| I feel that my direct neighbors that to see this residence, I feel that if my direct neighbors have to see this residence on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1825)|
| 0:30:33| and don't take issue with this being multifamily property, Mr. Redman and his homeowners association a mile away shouldn't take issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1833)|
| 0:30:43| I take great pride in my rentals and do not rent to anyone that I wouldn't want to have as a neighbor myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| The neighbors have all been given my personal info to contact me at any time regarding issues with the property or the residence of the duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| I have never received a call from anyone at any time to complain about my property or the tenants that I rent to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| The only calls I have ever received were to tell me that they are in support of upholding the MPC's decision to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1862)|
| 0:31:10| I've learned a great lesson in dealing with this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| I will never assume again that zoning is approved for a property that I'm looking to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| I've been told that I have a case to litigate the real estate company and previous owner of this duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| I won't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| I fully believe both parties were absolutely unaware of the situation as well as I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| Ma'am, you have about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| I also have been told that if this fire had never occurred or had been less than 50% damaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| it is unlikely that anyone would have ever realized the error in the zoning existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| I'm not here today to make excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| I purchased this duplex that has always been a multifamily home since its existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| I'm here today to say I'm trying to make the situation good and right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Please choose to uphold the MPC's final recommendation to approve the use on review for 5009 and 5007 Clover Road to remain a multifamily home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1911)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you in advance for your careful consideration to this unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| Do you have another speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| The residents I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Right, the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Yeah, would you like to just raise your hand, the residents that she mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Just raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Now, according to council rules, Mr. Redman, you've got two minutes for a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| I'm checking all the city records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| This house was installed there in 1981 or 82, well beyond the limit for grandfathering a piece of property like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1957)|
| 0:32:48| When I look at the website of the company that handled the sale to the current owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1968)|
| 0:32:56| I see that the opening page says there are 21 things you need to know that we are experts in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| Thing number three is city and county zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| So obviously it has not been rezoned or anything until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| To make it official does a great disservice to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| The other reality is with the family ordinance that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| it would be perfectly legal as a single family house to turn it into what people would call a mother-in-law house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| or for an extended family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| You can have a mother-in-law or father-in-law or whatever downstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| and as long as they are legitimately related, certainly we or none of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| or the homeowners association is going to object to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| It's the act of the rezoning that we do object to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you, Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| I wanted to ask Mark Donaldson real quick if he could speak to Ms. Balanji's comment about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| was there any erroneous misunderstanding of what was being requested at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| or what do you recall of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| I'm Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Ms. Balanji read the staff report as it reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| It says the approval of this request would result in the conversion of the existing detached dwelling on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| to a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| I think that probably is erroneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| Further, it says that staff is generally supportive of requests for duplexes in the R1 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| when the site is located on a collector or arterial street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| In this case, Clover is a local street within a couple hundred feet of Bradshaw Gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| which is a major collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| I would say that the planning commission was swayed by the fact that since the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| the structure was moved to that property in the early 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and established as a duplex that there had been no complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| and that they felt that the applicant wasn't provided all of the information at the time that she purchased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2109)|
| 0:35:21| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Well, you know, I really do appreciate the efforts to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2123)|
| 0:35:32| I'm a big supporter of infill and trying to get as many people within the city as we can inside the growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| and fill our city up without growing outwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| But I also feel like the zoning is very critical and important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| and we have to respect these transition areas if it's not right on a major road or arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| And, you know, we've got to draw the line somewhere within our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| even right off of these major arteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| And just, I mean, really looking at it, if we don't stand up for the legalities of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| and look at, you know, there was a recommendation during the fire or after the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| that they are requiring the owner to get a rezoning to operate the property as a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| So I really think, I mean, unfortunately, the evidence for the zoning speaks for itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| and I really have to make a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Madam Mayor, Mark Donaldson down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| It's been stated several times this evening that this is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| A duplex is a use permitted on review in the R1 zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| So we are not changing the zoning through this act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| We are simply acting to review a use that is permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Now discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| I have several concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| I'm sympathetic for the fact that you bought this thinking it was one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| and then found out it was something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| I'm also very concerned about this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| This is a neighborhood that, as Mr. Redman pointed out, is in transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| A lot of older people are perhaps moving to other circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| Younger people are moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| I also see that if this body approves or denies the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| what we will be saying is someone else in that neighborhood can go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| and buy a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| and then they can come before us or MPC for a use on review to have a duplex there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| And that is not in keeping with the character of this neighborhood at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| MPC staff stated that it was out of character for the neighborhood where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| And another piece of information that I obtained from Mr. Frost this afternoon is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2276)|
| 0:38:04| you cannot grandfather a piece of property's previous use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| That's just not something that we can be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| So I'm going to support the appeal of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| because I think it is the right thing to do for the integrity of that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| and to be sure that we are not setting a precedent for that specific neighborhood or some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| A Bradshaw Garden is not in my district now after redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| but I have worked with folks who lived in a Bradshaw Garden in that neighborhood previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| and I know that they're very concerned about maintaining the integrity of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| and keeping it a place that is very desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| And I will be supporting the appeal of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| Councilman Delevaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Yes, I appreciate what Councilwoman Palmer has expressed about the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| and its desire to keep its character intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| and that's, of course, what zoning is for is to protect those residents who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| There was a statement you made about the grandfathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| I'm going to ask Mr. Frost to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| My thought on it is that you can only grandfather a use that's legal at the time you do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| and then if the rules change, you're kind of still in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| But I want to hear from our lawyer because he would know better how to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| Very briefly, illegal uses are not grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| Unfortunately, the property owner was led to believe one thing, which, unfortunately, it's another thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| but that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Illegal uses aren't grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| So you're saying it has to be a legitimate use at the time, and if the rules later change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| you can't apply the new rules to an old use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| That's correct, as long as you maintain that previous use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Okay, we have a motion and a second to approve the appeal of the Norwood Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| 11B is a resolution expressing its support for the continued use of the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| in guiding zoning decisions in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| 11C is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| I'm sorry, I didn't sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| On behalf of a bunch of organizations that asked for the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| we just want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| We think the one-year plan is something, along with our enhanced services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| and our professional departments, is such a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| The one-year plan is such a benefit to this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| and we think it's a quality-of-life issue, and we appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| 11C is a resolution authorizing submission of the 2013-14 Action Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| to the Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| and authorizing the mayor to execute any required documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| under the Community Development Block Grant Home Investment Partnership Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| Fair Housing Assistance, and Emergency Solutions grant programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| So moved for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Becky was so helpful in explaining this to us during the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| Folks at home may not have seen that workshop, as exciting as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| One of the things that's still up in the air is we don't know the exact amount that HUD may approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2503)|
| 0:41:52| but we're anticipating at this time something like a 5% decrease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| and the figures you have in this information document reflect that sort of assumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| but it'll be what it'll be, as I understand your explanation at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| Could you comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| We had to go ahead and produce our plan based on estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| We were advised that our current year funding would be cut by 5% due to the sequestration that went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2541)|
| 0:42:30| We don't have our final numbers yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| We hope to get those before we have to turn the plan in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| HUD has until June the 10th to supply us with those actual numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| and we feel like we'll get those before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| So we don't feel we're going to be off base too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| and we certainly won't make any changes to any of the programs that we presented in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| But you'll live with whatever budget you ultimately get, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Yes, we have to live with what we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| As a follow-up, a lot of these funds go outside of the city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| to organizations that effectuate the activities that repair homes and do those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| Do you have any staff positions at risk if the budget cuts are different than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| In other words, more severe than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| I mean, our administrative funds are capped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| and, you know, our staff is paid with project delivery dollars and administration dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| and as those go down, we have to look at those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| Well, thank you very much for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| I just have one quick question, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Is the front door facade program, will that continue in 2013-14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| The My Front Yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| My Front Yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| It will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| We had to cut that, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| You may be able to paint your front door, George, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| The yard, they can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| I have to say, having been in Becky's position for four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| I really appreciate what they have had to do to put this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| along with Community Development Administrator Linda Rust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| It's an arduous process each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| and when you don't really know how much funding you're going to get, it makes it even more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| But I think they've done a really good job in trying to stretch resources as much as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| and, of course, in partnership with the other folks who receive some of the funding, our housing partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| And they do a lot of good with that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute change order number four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| to contract number C9105 between the City of Knoxville and Vaughn & Melton Consulting Engineers, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| to increase the contract price by $164,934 for a new contract total of $2,153,855| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2686)|
| 0:44:57| for completion of the Cumberland Avenue Streetscapes Improvements Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| I'm in general agreement with this, but I was just going to ask Mr. Wetzel to explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| just give us an update on the project and explain the new proposal for the construction in two phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| and the advantages of that for the project and for the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| As you all know, we are dividing the project into two phases now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| The first phase, if you all take this action, will go into two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| The second phase will run from Alcoa Highway to 22nd Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| which is a part of the project that's going to remain a five-lane section throughout the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| The big advantage this gives us is traffic flow during the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| Everything north of Cumberland that works out of the Fort Sanders Hospital area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| will be able to move from 22nd Street down to the five-lane section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| Everything in the University area coming out volunteer can come out volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| and move into the five-lane section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| So that's going to help tremendously when we move into Phase 2, which will run from 22nd to 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| Also, this will allow us to coordinate with the University Commons development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| which is underway at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| They would anticipate that they would open their door sometime next summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| If we move forward with this six-month Phase 1 project, we'll be able to do that seamlessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| We'll be able to coordinate seamlessly with the entrance to and from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| which will be a great benefit to the public and to the investment we have in that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| Thirdly, we think there's another great chance to improve traffic flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| and that we're going to be able to add an extra lane to a striping program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| that will give us a continuous right turn lane off of Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| to Alcoa Highway northbound, which will lead you to I-40 east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| Right now, one car can stop in that lane, and that holds everybody up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| So by getting a continuous right-hand turn lane basically from the creek, it's tight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| but we'll have a six-car queuing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| So if we get six cars, we'll be able to slide people on through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| and get them out to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| In doing that, we will be coordinating the intersections at Volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| and University Commons slash Metron Way and Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| All that signaling should all be coordinated to that time, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| So we'll make great strides in traffic flow, plus we'll be helping coordinate economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| So we think it's a great step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| We're glad to be headed this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| Your light's still on for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| I hadn't called on you yet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Councilman Della Vopi, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| It was Councilman Steyer that asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| I just wanted you to point out we're talking about a $2.1 million, $2.2 million ballpark project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| The city's share is how much, 40 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| This is 80-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| 80-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| The total project is closer to a $16 million project, and we're still within that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| But the contract portion, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Well, the contract portion, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| And it's an 80-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| The rest is federal dollars that we're getting through the highway department, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| And a way to break this one down, if you look at this particular contract amendment, that's $34,000 local dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| You know, they're going into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| One other thing, just while I have the floor a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| You're going to start to see more items come up for Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| We are making real progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| I mean, we're hoping to bring you construction documents for Phase 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| or construction bids for Phase 2 by late this summer, end of this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| So we're hoping that could actually happen in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| We're going to have a license agreement with the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| You all will need to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| We're going to have construction inspection agreements you all are going to need to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| So just know that Cumberland is going to start to become more and more part of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| as we move forward with these projects, which is pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| It's taken us five years to get here, but we're starting to get very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| If I could ask Jim Hagerman, when I heard the mayor's budget presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| one of the things we're doing is getting a little more computer oomph in our traffic control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| Will that help if that goes through with this kind of a project where you can better manage traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| coming out of University Commons and down Cumberland to get it to where it's going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| Jim Hagerman, director of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| All of that stuff for this project is taken care of within this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| And Vaughn and Melton will be doing that part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| Their sub-consultant is Gretchen Smith, and they'll be doing that work on the signalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| The bigger picture, this will tie into the bigger system as we improve the bigger system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2965)|
| 0:49:35| The whole Kingston Pike corridor is high on the list of corridors to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| And I'm sure when Jim York puts pen to paper when he gets around to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| he'll find that we're saving cat dollars if those buses keep moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| instead of trying to stop those battleships too often as they go down the main boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| So we're looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| We think that's going to be a good tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| We've got a lot of modelists out there who have done a lot of work on this Cumberland project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the public building authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| for the transfer of surplus city equipment to decommissioned utility vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| and one midsize sedan for a total price of $13,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| to trade seized weapons titled in the name of the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| to Elmer Arms South LLC for 206-45 caliber handguns and certain other weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Councilman Delivante.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Chief, since you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| I know we started this about maybe six months ago or so that you presented this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| What happens to the weapons that we're kind of trading in to be recycled, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| through this outfit Elmer Arms South?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| In other words, is there some controlled resale of that that they will be carrying out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| once we trade them in and it's out of our hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| I mean, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| They were awarded the bid and they will get the weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| We do this quite frequently, actually, with seized weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| The law changed where we could no longer destroy the weapons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| so the only thing we can do with them now is either hold on to them for the rest of the life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| or to trade them for equipment, and so that's what we do with them is we trade them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3088)|
| 0:51:35| Obviously, Elmer Arms is a reputable dealer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| and so what he'll do is these guns are in various levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| Some are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Some are garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| So he'll go through that and fix those that he can, and then he'll turn them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| Typically what he'll do, because he's not a direct-to-the-public seller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| so what he'll do is he'll sell them to an authorized firearms dealer that sells to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3114)|

| 0:55:52| I'm certainly going to support this, but I would like to ask Mr. Grace, I think I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3352)|

| 0:56:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Michael Grace, one of the owners of the Medical Arts Building at 603 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| It is a very exciting project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| We're sad to see the lights turn off when we're above 80% vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| It's a beautiful building, probably the only Gothic revival structure in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| With the whole residential boom happening, we feel that the project is going to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| 49 residences, which would be 77 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| We have 106 stall parking garage, covered parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3397)|

| 0:57:09| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| As long as we've got you there, let's ask a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Of course, it is a gorgeous building, and it is somewhat unique for Knoxville, so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| important that we preserve it and keep it working and repurposing as you describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| Explain the – I'm a little naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Explain the economics to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| We're going to put $8 million in a $2 million building, and then it will be worth $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| and I was struggling with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| I realize there's rent somewhere in the middle of that, but it seemed a little unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| Why isn't the value of the building more if one completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| Let me step into that, Michael, if I could, first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| That appraised value comes from the Knox County Property Assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| Typically, he goes at $60,000 a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| If you do your easy math, 50 times 6 is $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| Then you add on the residential spaces, and that's where you get to the 3.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| A little thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| The total project cost is $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| Mike can help me here if I get this wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Basically, the building itself is valued at $2.9, and construction is right at $5 million at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| It will be close to $8 million into this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| And pilots, well, so anyway, that's up to Knox County Property Assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| That's something either Mr. Grace or I have a lot of control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| I didn't know if they were using federal government math or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| I just wanted to understand how that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| He's using entrepreneur math and hoping it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| Now, you're getting a 10-year pilot out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| After 10 years pass, the rate that you repay the city regular taxes will kick up, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3518)|
| 0:58:46| After 10 years, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| Whatever the evaluation is at that time will be the full tax value at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Also, before we move on, I think, Bob, there are some corrections in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| I need to make at least a statement of where we made a mistake in filling out the AIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| which got transferred into the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Current county taxes are $21,310.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| Somehow I picked up the number and put $21,523 into this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| I'm not quite sure where that $200 discrepancy came from, but that was pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| The IDB staff is already looking at this, and they already pointed out, well, what's the number here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| So it really should be county taxes $21,310 as opposed to $21,523.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| So we will change that in the official record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Can you raise the city taxes while you're making the math change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| I want to ask, could you tell us roughly if this goes through with everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| what kind of price range are you talking in terms of the rental for these apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| Presently, we have the pro forma at an average rent of about $1,000 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| $1,025 actually right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| And there's a mix between pretty much a 50-50 mix between one-bedroom, one-bath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| and two-bedroom, two-bath where there is actually one three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| that extends above the garage on the second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| That would be obviously at a higher price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| But the average price per unit would be about $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| I've toured the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| and I appreciate the investment that you all made in downtown and the preservation of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| You know, if you've lived in Knoxville a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| then there's a good chance you went to the dentist there or the doctor or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| So it has a very longstanding history in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| So I'm very excited about you all coming in and making that investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| and making those improvements to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| And I appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| I'm also going to support it and think it's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| I just also wanted to make the comment that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| one reason why this is occurring is that they were having real problems renting out the space as office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| And I think we just need to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| And downtown, that's becoming a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| And I recently read an article where all across the country that's occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| that fewer and fewer people are working downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| So I think as leaders in the community development department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| I think it's great that we're doing projects like this and repurposing buildings quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| and not letting them stay vacant and getting them used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| And that way we keep our downtown healthy and vibrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| So, you know, I think it's a good project and I'm supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3701)|

| 1:01:45| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| We look forward to seeing the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Item 12A is an ordinance appropriating some of $5,340| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| from the Parks and Recreation Department's Grants and Benevolence Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3714)|

| 1:02:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3727)|

| 1:02:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| Nobody has signed up for public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Oh, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| I'm not having public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Immediately after this room is somewhat cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| we will have a special beer board hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| There's just one item, and I believe it will go very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| So there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3749)|

| 1:03:01| This is a preservation pub application, Paula West McAnally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| I've had five people tell me six different ways, so I'm glad to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| It gets mangled quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| I answer to any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3792)|

| 1:03:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Now, before we hear a motion on this, tell us about the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| because I'm hearing some really good things about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| When is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| And who is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| It's actually very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| It's going to be this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| And I'm actually going to let Ava, who's the Director of POLIN now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| come up and tell you about it, because she has a nice accent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| and is going to know a lot more about it than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| But I wanted to say thank you, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| for you all doing this special meeting for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| I know you're anxious to get out of here, so we do appreciate that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| But here is Ava, and she can tell you about this event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| and it does sound really wonderful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| and hopefully you all can make it out to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Ava, if you will say your name, address, and you've got three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| My name is Ava Nations, 1201 Apolusa Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| We are celebrating May 3rd, which is this Friday, Contemporary Polish Culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| We are bringing modern things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| We want to educate Knoxville and develop a relationship between Poland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| and the United States, friendly relationships that will hopefully continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| So Poland now is a civic organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| that will present the contemporary Poland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130430?start=3878)|
