| 0:01:18| on design in our work, and so we're really excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| to have him join our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=80)|

| 0:01:29| and he recently joined our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| as a planner in our transportation group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=91)|

| 0:01:55| and we are really excited to have him on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| and working with our transportation planning group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=118)|

| 0:02:11| in front of you, and if you don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| we have copies for you before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| Aubrey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| Thanks, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| As Amy said, I'll be reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| on the 2023 Development Activity Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| This is a report on indicators related to development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| in Knox County throughout the 2023 calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| We produce an update of this report every spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| and we have been doing so for about 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| We use building permits, rezonings, and subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| as metrics to discuss development in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| Rezonings and subdivisions are handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| by planning, and building permits come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| from the county, city, and town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| We use building permits to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| what is being built or completed right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| whereas rezonings and subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| give us an idea of what's coming in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| This graphic represents the percent change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| from five years previous in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| for residential and non-residential uses of each indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| Residential rezonings and building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| were higher in 2023 than in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| This fits expectations given the local focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| on housing development since 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| Residential subdivisions were lower in 2023 than in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| but non-residential were higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| And in this presentation, we'll look into details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| of these three growth indicators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| Starting off with building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| the chart on the left summarizes residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| and non-residential permits by sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Northwest County had the most overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| with over 2,000 new units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| just dwarfing every other planning sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| Last year, Southwest County was in the lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| with 1,062 units, and this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| there were only 348 in that sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| And the chart on the right shows the difference in growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| in just Northwest and Southwest County's sectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| from last year's report to this year's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| Huge change both in Northwest County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| and in Southwest County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| Most of the permits were for residential units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| so we see pretty much the same pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| looking at only residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| We report residential units by four types of structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| single-family detached, multi-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| mobile homes, and single-family attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| One trend that has cropped up in recent years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| is a surge in multi-family housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| including outside of city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| which was not the case a decade ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| either before or after the Great Recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| In 2023, there were more multi-family units permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| than single-family detached houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| For the past two years, about 50% of all housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| permitted countywide have been multi-family units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| This is tied to Apartments for UT and market response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| to the need for housing at multiple price points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| including affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| and a high percentage of residential permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| in the city of Knoxville are for multi-family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| Pictured here is your city's housing market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| pictured here is Yardley Flats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| which is one of the apartment buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| that will frame the sides of the new multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| Its approximate value is $30 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| but the biggest development permit in the county in 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| was Lovano-Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| which is bringing 348 units to Blount Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| in South Knoxville for $81 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| Southwest County had the most non-residential permits at 32,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| and most of those permits were for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| While the number of permits is significantly lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| the non-residential investment in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| is still substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| There were only 127 non-residential permits issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| but they were valued at an average of $2.7 million each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| In comparison, the average value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| of residential units permitted was $230,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| One non-residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| that's on a lot of our minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| is, of course, the previously mentioned stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| It's supposed to be done by this time next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| and the downtown stadium's permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| are for an investment of $80 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| This doesn't represent the full cost of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| In this residential building activity map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| you can see a lot of developments around the city core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=377)|

| 0:06:23| There's a dense cluster development, Cluster UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| which represents a lot of the off-campus housing developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| that have been permitted in the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| and many of the developments that are over 50 housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| are in Northwest County, Central City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=393)|

| 0:06:51| You can still see a bit of the post-recession hangover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| in 2014 and 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| but we get back up to pre-recessionary numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| in the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| In non-residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| it's still a pretty flat trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| There's been very little year-over-year change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| in investment in the past decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| In terms of investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| 2023 was a record-breaking year in dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| spent on new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=435)|

| 0:07:23| 2023 was the first year that residential construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| broke $1 billion, even when accounting for inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| Nearly $1.2 billion in residential construction were spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| and $338 million was spent in non-residential construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| Once again, we can see those post-recession values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=459)|

| 0:08:07| That's an unusual amount of rezonings for a city sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| The biggest rezoning of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| was for 196 acres in the Northwest County sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| which was rezoned from agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| rural commercial, plant commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=499)|

| 0:08:30| was fewer than the previous two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| However, at 32 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| there were more non-residential lots created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| than in the past four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| We track final plots, some administrative plots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| but not concept plans for this data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| And Northwest County had the most subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| and the most lots created by subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| North City, once again, stands out among the city sectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| suggesting that North City may have more development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| coming down the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| And the development with the largest number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| of lots created this year was Chapman Trait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| creating 116 lots in South City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| and the largest number of lots created in West City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=545)|

| 0:09:12| creating 116 lots in South County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| But the development that subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| the highest acreage property was Midway Business Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| which is on 341 acres in East County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| A few final takeaways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Northwest County drew the most attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| in almost every chart I showed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Building permits, rezonings, and subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Northwest County has it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Southwest County actually didn't stand out much this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| with none of the largest developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| in the county occurring in that area in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| And all the other county sectors stood out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| over the city sectors overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| They're larger in land area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| especially land that hasn't been built out yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| so this isn't particularly surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| And Central City and South City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| stood out in new units permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| while the North City had a high number of rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| and subdivisions for a city sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| And I'm happy to answer any questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| If there are any, feel free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Do we look at kind of how the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| like, say, overall net unit additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| compares to, like, population growth in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| and sort of look at, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| population's growing at 5% or 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| whereas net units are growing at 1.2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| relative to overall units prior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| Do we have, I'm just curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| if that's part of this report at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| It's not part of this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| We have other tools on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| that do show population change over time by sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| If you pull up Panorama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| there are different population trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| and variables available there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Cool, I'll check that out, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| So just expanding on that, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| and I'm not sure if this is where you were going with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| but I'm kind of curious to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| I mean, I think you had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| maybe 1,100 lots got put on the ground in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| That's a single-family type scenario, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| And of course, we got a bunch of apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| that have come online, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| But I guess it comes down to the residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| I mean, how many residential units were done in 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| and how many people moved here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| I guess that's kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| you were talking in percentages, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| but I'm just trying to understand the delta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Yeah, just thinking if one of the overall goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| is to help preserve affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| and kind of match population growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| how do we think about physical development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| matching that human migration and weighing the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| I don't know that answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| but just would be curious to see those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| maybe side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| So yeah, I'm excited to look at Panorama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| And it's a concern, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| because I mean, I think it's widely known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| that they're anticipating about 80,000 or so people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| moving to the region and the area over the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| And what I'm seeing here is it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| you know, the available lots and the available housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| is actually trending down a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| while more people are moving here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| which is gonna push prices up even higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| you know, from a supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| I mean, we can't force people to sell their land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| and developers to develop their land to provide the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| but it is, you know, an interesting dynamic happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| Just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=738)|
| 0:12:27| Great, thank you, Aubrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| And we'll send out a link to Panorama| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| for everyone to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| Okay, so we'll get started with our review of agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| We're gonna start off with agenda item number 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| The applicant is Andrew Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| This is a rezoning and a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Let me just let Samuel get a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| I'll give him a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| There he goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| So this is city rezoning in the Inskip neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| for which we are recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| The request is to go from RN2 to RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| This will also require a plan amendment from LDR to MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| This part of Inskip neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| is predominantly zoned RN1 and RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| with some properties north of Parkway being zoned RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| This includes the, I'm gonna turn on my laser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| This includes the two adjacent RN5 properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| along Inskip Road, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| The general development pattern in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| consists of detached houses and duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| with multifamily developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| primarily on properties zoned RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| The subject parcel currently accommodates a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=827)|
| 0:13:56| The adjacent apartments that we saw in the last map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| already existed when the sector plan was adopted in 27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| but the sector plan still recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| the LDR land use classification for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| The sector plan called out for down zoning this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| and allowing medium density residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| only on, sorry, only on classified streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| that provide increased traffic demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| The one-year plan land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| is the same for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=872)|
| 0:14:39| Inskip small area plan, which was adopted in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| echoed the desire to down zone the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| to conserve the lower density residential character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| of this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| The plan recommended down zoning the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| south of West Parkway Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| which includes the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| These recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| sorry, I'm just trying to turn off the pointer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| so I can scroll on my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| These recommendations were reflected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| by general rezoning initiated by the city council in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| which incorporated additional community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=920)|
| 0:15:28| Staff recommends denial of the MDR classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| and RN4 district because it is inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| with the sector plan and Inskip small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| The present RN2 district is comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| with this plan's recommendation of R1A district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| There has not been any major improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| on Inskip Road or West Parkway Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| since the adoption of these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Recent significant development in this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| is at least one mile away from the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| The increased density that could result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| from RN4 development is not supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| by the lack of pedestrian connectivity in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| As you can see in this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| the lack of sidewalks which are represented by the red lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| The closest transit route along Cedar Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| north of the property is being discontinued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| according to the Get Reimagined recommended network report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| And lastly, due to the small lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| and RN4 development could feel much more tense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| than that of surrounding area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1001)|
| 0:16:51| Commissioner Adams, did you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| before you all switch, did you have another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| you wanted to add to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| If you could add 45 for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Okay, Samuel, that is your case, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| 45 is on Sevier Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1025)|
| 0:17:05| He's not, I know you're not prepared to cover it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| but did you have specific questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| The original case file was requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| a pretty intensive RN7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| I can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Originally, and Samuel can speak to this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| but originally the applicant I think had requested RN7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| perhaps before we had a conversation with them about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| And they ended up amending their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| And so that, the application as amended is shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| And for some reason, KJS was still pulling up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| that old request, but their request is RN4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| for this property, not RN7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| Is that correct, Samuel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1070)|
| 0:17:50| And we are actually recommending RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| And I talked to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| and they are okay with our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| Okay, so I'll go back and look at the updated materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| there, but the recommendation from staff is RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| They're fine with that, but this is not on consent, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1088)|
| 0:18:15| We determine what goes on consent after this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| and then before we post it, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| But if there's things that you want us to cover now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| and we can, are you interested in the development potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| I'm trying to recalibrate my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| because of what the case file came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| what I was looking at originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| and the RN7 being so, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| out of scale with what the area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| So that I need to get cozier with the RN3 options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| that are there just to understand what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| and like what the most intensive option would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| under the RN3 recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Yeah, that would be, so they could request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| in RN3, they could do duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| and then they also could do townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| It's all limited by the size of their lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| And if they were to do townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| it would have to come back before you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| for a special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| And I know, Samuel, you did some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| back of the envelope calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| of what they potentially could develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| correct, under RN3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| In terms of number, it's not that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| With RN3, they can do up to one duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1171)|

| 0:26:29| to create neighborhoods with a variety of housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| and amenities in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| The recommendation is to approve PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1595)|

| 0:26:40| And with one condition that the rear of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| with slopes 25% or greater at approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1603)|

| 0:26:59| Okay. Seeing no questions. Thank you, Whitney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1619)|
| 0:27:08| We will switch over to Jesse for items number 44 and 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1628)|
| 0:27:23| Yes, this case is for almost an acre size property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| at the corner of Kingston Pike and Agnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| The request is to rezone from CG3 to CG1 general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| As you can see in the image here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| there is a bus stop directly in front of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| There are sidewalks along both sides of the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| shown in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| And the Bearden Greenway Trailhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| is located nearby to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| at the Bearden Elementary and Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| It's also noteworthy that a substantial portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| of this property in the rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| is the Bearden Christian Cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| which has tombstones dating back to the late 1800s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| In the zoning map, you'll see that this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| is part of a cohesive CG3 block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| and there is a CG1 across Agnes Road to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| This property is part of a mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| in the sector plan and the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| which is informed by the adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Bearden Village Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1700)|

| 0:28:26| emphasize pedestrian orientation and walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| along this section of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| Staff are recommending denial of CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Even though they're both general commercial zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| and they permit all the same uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| there are substantial differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| between the dimensional and design standards of CG1 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| CG3 has a front and corner side build-to zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| and percentage requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| that bring the building closer to the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| This makes buildings more approachable on foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| and it's designed to foster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| a more pedestrian-oriented environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| CG1 has no front setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| or corner side setback requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| meaning the buildings could be set far back from the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| CG1 has no design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| whereas CG3 has facade, fenestration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| and site design standards that mitigate things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| like large blank walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| There's minimum transparency requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| There's circulation and building entrance standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| that emphasize the human-scale interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| with the building and pedestrian safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| A rezoning to CG1 would enable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| more auto-oriented development to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| and this conflicts with the future vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| of this area laid out in the adopted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| It's also incompatible with the pedestrian infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| that exists in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| where you have designated crosswalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| sidewalks on both sides, a greenway trailhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| an elementary and middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| a bus stop directly in front of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| There's also pedestrian safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| that should be considered on the site itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| with the historic cemetery in the rear of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| For these reasons, we recommend denial of CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| and maintaining the CG3 zoning that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| So I do have one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| I'm sorry, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| So, I mean, between CG3 and CG1, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| they're both just heavy commercial uses in the city zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| but is it, does it deny the walkability side if it's CG1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| I mean, does it take away from it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| I guess that's where I'm struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| I'm trying to understand that somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| can't ride their bike up to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| I'm trying to understand that somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| can't ride their bike up to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| or they can't walk up to it if it's CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| only if it's CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| I guess you could say that CG1 would enable development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| that is less pedestrian-oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| whereas CG3 has standards in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| that require it to be more pedestrian-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| I'm hearing that it's the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| that is the primary difference between these two zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| that the applicant, tell me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| the applicant will be able to conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| the commercial activities that they want to conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| in either zone, but the current zoning of CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| encourages the type of design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| that will help with that walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| and that greater sense of pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| and community, as opposed to a more automotive experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| Yes, well put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Yeah, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1897)|
| 0:31:37| All the uses are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| I mean, do we know what the use is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| I mean, what the applicant is planning on doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| We, as staff, try not to consider potential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| at the rezoning stage, but there was a pre-submittal meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| for a drive-through facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1912)|
| 0:32:00| Yeah, and I mean, just looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| because this one's a little bit from a pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| versus vehicular, it's on a corner, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| So it's got road on two sides of it, which almost, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| would lean it more towards needing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| to be a little more automotive-friendly versus not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| I'm just thinking out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| I'm just trying to review the file here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Jesse, you made a comment about pedestrian safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| as it relates to the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| Could you, I guess, explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| So when I went to post this sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| I went back and saw that there were flowers on tombstones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| and these tombstones are very, very old from the late 1800s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| So thinking about some of the site design standards in CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| that prioritize pedestrian safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| just the fact that those standards don't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| there are no design standards yet for CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| So thinking of it in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| at least you have some higher level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| of pedestrian safety assurance with the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| design on the site itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| And considering that there is this pedestrian, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| attraction on the site, that was just another note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| It appears that part of our challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| is that we don't have design standards for CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| and I think city council has challenged the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| department to come up with some of those design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| So it appears that we kind of default| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| to the reason we don't give another CG or CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| is because we don't have design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| Mr. Snowden there, if the owner pushed that building up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| to zero on the lot line, and I know this is probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| I don't know how much purview you have over at versus TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| City staff, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| I'm sorry, I've got agencies mixed up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| But as we look at, would there be any concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| for line of sight if you push the building up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| to zero on that corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2062)|
| 0:34:46| Any concern about curb cuts as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| relates to pushing the building up to zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| You've got to be 20 feet off, minimum 20 feet off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| each neighbor's property line, and how you would situate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2100)|
| 0:35:19| If you're 100 or 150 feet away from the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| streetwise, or either road, in terms of neighbors' property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| lines, you're going to be off the danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| So depending on if they want to access the entire address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| you might have different requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| If you don't, try to get people to the access road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| or have a ride-in, ride-out only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| So again, that would be serious as I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| And just to clarify, Ms. Hillman probably already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| stated this, but the build-to zone is zero to 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| It's not a requirement to be at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| It is zero to 20, but if the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| decided he wanted to go to zero, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| just want to look at the practicality of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| This may have been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| I may have missed it, but I know that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| discussed this area a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Is there a specific overlay or design goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| for this intersection in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| like a long-term plan or something for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| There is a TDOT plan to widen that North Shore and Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| Is this part of the Bearden plan as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| Is there any way that that could be added to the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| to, or like the relevant pages of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| or maybe a link sent out to that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Because I'd like to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| When you said Bearden plan, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| the same thing as Homburg plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| There's a Bearden Village Opportunities plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| It's a small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| I can show you on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| It may be fixing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Yeah, if you want to pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| And then we can also send out a link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| I will say that one of maybe either city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| or county engineering, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| but the intersection improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| that TDOT was proposing did not make it into their 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| It doesn't mean that it couldn't come back up next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| but currently it's not part of their short-term plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| for improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| You mean the North Shore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Yeah, North Shore, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2262)|
| 0:37:42| North Shore and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Small area plans are identified here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| and there's the Bearden Village Opportunities plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| And I'll send this out by email, but just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| so you know how to navigate that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| How do I extend this so I can see what I'm doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| I can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Oh, I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Sounds like Jessie's lost her screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Sorry, I have a weird screen set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| OK, so now we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Unless there's other questions, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| move on to agenda item number 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| So this is 7A24HPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| This is the second ever level two hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2315)|

| 0:38:41| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Typically, hillside protection COAs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| are handled at the administrative level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| by planning staff who verify that a grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| plan for a proposed development is staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| within the permitted disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| or what we call the disturbance budget, which is determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| through the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| This certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| comes before you, or request for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| comes before you because the applicant is requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| to exceed that disturbance limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| The parcel is located at 5233 McIntyre Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| in the Alice Bell Spring Hill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| It's approximately 70 and 1 half acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| There are about 42 and 1 half acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| that are not within the hillside protection overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| and do not have disturbance regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| and 28 acres are within the hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| The property is almost entirely forested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| and much of it is mature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| There hasn't been significant disturbance on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| since about 1985, according to historical aerial maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| The property is zoned RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| And in February of 2023, a 290 lot single family subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| was approved under certain conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| One of those conditions was verifying compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| with the hillside protection disturbance budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| Within those 28 acres that are within the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| overlay, there are approximately 19.13%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| that can be disturbed, or about 70% that can be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| The applicant is requesting to disturb 22.81 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| or about 81%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| And so that's in excess of 3.73 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| In the concept plan that was reviewed last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| the estimated disturbance within the hillside protection overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| was 19.15 acres, which is equivalent to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| they're allowed to disturb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| What I've encircled in red is their stormwater detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| area at that time, because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| where the increase in disturbance occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| So as you can see in their current site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| their previous stormwater detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| was undersized for development of this scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| They had to increase their detention area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| and this is where the increase in that disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| The applicant is now asking to exceed the disturbance budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| and this is in an area that has not been previously disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| The hillside protection overlay zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| stems from the adopted hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| The goal of this plan is to protect forested ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| and hillsides that are a defining feature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| of the region's natural heritage and a primary contributor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| to maintaining property values, clean air and water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| and wildlife habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| This is only the second level two hillside protection case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| to come before you, and it is the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| to have no extenuating circumstances that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| provide an argument for exceeding the disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| This decision will set an important precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| Their request does not meet any of the exemption criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| provided in Article 8.9 of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| Rather than right-size their development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| to accommodate proper stormwater management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| and fit within the hillside protection limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| they are essentially sticking with their original plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| and not complying with the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| Stormwater engineering staff did share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| that there may be alternative layouts for stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| management that have not been explored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| such as dispersing detention throughout the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| There is no hardship here that prevents compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| and complying does not deprive the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| of reasonable use of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| So we do recommend denying this level two COA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2549)|
| 0:42:39| Thank you, Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| We'll go on to agenda item number 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2561)|
| 0:42:49| The next four are Mike Reynolds' cases while him gets set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2569)|
| 0:42:59| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| The cable is not long enough to reach over to the other spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2586)|
| 0:43:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2609)|
| 0:43:50| OK, the first one we're going to go over is 7W24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| So what you see on the screen are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| several associated rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| But the one on the right side in the red dash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| is the property under question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| So what the request is is to rezone the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| from A, agricultural, to PR, planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| to five dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| Staff is recommending approval of the five dwellings per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Two conditions are no clearing or grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| until a development plan is approved by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| Commission, and number two, land disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| within the hillside protection area should not exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| The recommended disturbance of the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| this is for the new commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| a very similar, or actually the same proposed conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| were recommended by the Planning Commission last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| for the 1K24RZ, which is the larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2692)|
| 0:45:00| This property here, so last month the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| did recommend approval of planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| on this yellow kind of area with the two conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| that I'm also recommending for this site, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| is the 7W24RZ site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| See, so if you're not familiar with this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| it's off Chapman Highway down by Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| right near the county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| So this property has frontage on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| or this portion of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| actually the parcel itself is much larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| It has frontage on Sevierville Pike and Evans Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Evans Road is a little side street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| There is a PQ, what you see on the existing land use map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| is called quasi-public, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| a fairly large cemetery that's just to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| And then there's a church, and the PP is existing ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| But you'll see, in general, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| a lot of undeveloped land in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| or larger single-family lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Zoning, again, it's primarily agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| There is planned residential off to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| Again, so this is actually part of the same property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| had that PR rezoning last year some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| In this area, I'm just going to try to go through this pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| There are a couple of streams through the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| There's definitely one that shows up on the land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| or on the base map along Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| So this is Sevierville Pike here and Evans Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| the little side street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| The other stream that comes through the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| is not shown on the base map as a blue line stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| but it does, it's pretty prominent on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| So that'll have to be studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| That'll have to be studied later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| But it's a planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| that gives the Planning Commission that review authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| And also the developer can cluster units if they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| Comprehensive plan is suburban residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| I'm not going to go through all the attributes of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| but it kind of goes through in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| The planned residential zone is a partially related place type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| or a zone in suburban residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| So that means we need to look at these three criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| It does have to meet one of the three criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| And pretty much what staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| is that it does meet this number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| the proposed zoning district is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| with the current zoning on adjacent sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| The main thing is that the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| does allow flexibility with development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| So it can, you can cluster on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| which is what the comprehensive plan recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| for areas with hillside protection on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| It also allows us to look at compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| to adjacent sites and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| So that's what we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| I'm saying that how this meets the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| Slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| So this is where that condition kind of comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| Slope analysis recommends 7.4 acres of disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| within the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| which is the area with the speckles on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| here in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| There's 13.5 acres of hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| of the 23-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| So with this recommended condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| if the developer or the property owner develops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| within the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| they can only disturb 7.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| There is a language in that condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| that does allow the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| to consider more disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| And really the intent there is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| allow a little bit of flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| not to, the intent obviously isn't to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| open it up to complete disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| but just wanted to make you aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| that there is that flexibility written in the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| We went over this last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| so I'm not going to go through it too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Chapman Highway, there are some improvements in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| particularly what TDOT has been doing to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| It's widening at any center turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| and also they've already made intersection improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| at Sevierville Pike and Simpson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| just to the south of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| Just real quick about Evans Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| It is no longer connected through to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| It is a dead end street now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| It's about 16 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| does have a pretty narrow culvert over a creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| that would probably need to be widened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| if the development does access Evans Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| and goes back towards Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| And there is a creek, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| that is between the available area of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| and Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| I'm sorry, not Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| Yeah, sorry, Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3004)|
| 0:50:11| And as I stated previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| we're recommending approval of planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| up to five dwellings per acre with the two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| What relationship does this have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| to the Bauer Field activity that took place yesterday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| Well, so Bauer Field is just to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| where the rezoning 1L24RZ is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| They're postponing that for one more month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| because it requires a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| The plan amendment can't happen until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| So it's related only that it's adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| but it's not on the same portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Evans Road does separate the Bauer Field location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| to this northern part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| But thank you, that answers that part of my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| but it makes me have another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| which is it is all part of one whole development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| or it's one common holding company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| One common holding company, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| And that would be a good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| for the applicant themselves about what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| if they have a plan for the entire site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| just sort of in general what their plans are specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| I guess what I'm getting at is the division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| of the applications, I guess why they have been divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| Well, I can do my best to help address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| Like I said, the Planning Commission did hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| 1K24RZ last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| It was originally a January application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| They could not apply for the subject site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| back at that time because the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| did not allow consideration of this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| So they chose to hold off on applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| for this portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| That's why it's a separate piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| And the other ones, it made more sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| to separate the residential rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| from the commercial rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| just so that we can talk about them separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| and not have them as one application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| which kind of complicated everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| So that's why there's a lot of different applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| For those, especially the newer Planning Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| they had two other rezonings back in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| on the south side of Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| to CA General Business and Planned Residential as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| So we have five applications total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| with this kind of grouping of rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| I just needed a little reminder on some of that history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| but also just the whole picture there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| I guess I have a question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| I'm a little confused, not to add more confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| to an already somewhat confusing request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| The Bower Field that you brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| I thought they had made application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| I guess I thought it was going to be on this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Did they remove it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Well, so what happened is the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| designation for the site does not allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| consideration of the CA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| so they need to amend the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| That can only happen in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| so they need to push it back to the August agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| But they were okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| They have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| I guess because I was, and I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| because this is all kind of new territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| They're aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| They haven't been pushing back against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| It needs to be in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Yeah, I guess because I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| I mean, as a body, we could consider it if we wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| because I know we haven't really considered any of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| we haven't yet, have we, considered any of the new changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| No, and let me just add that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| an applicant can ask you all to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| If it's an application before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| staff is recommending postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| We would strongly recommend postponement for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| for this to go forward in August to adhere to that schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| as well as, you know, Mike mentioned the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| That was something that we were already considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| You know, when I talked about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| earlier during our workshop session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| related to this matrix and how, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| as we are getting applications and reviewing them with this new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| plan, we're identifying, oh, there's maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| where we didn't necessarily capture all the zones in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| appropriate place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| So we do want to make some recommendations associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| that, and that was actually separate from this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| So, but it's technically on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| It's just recommended postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| Is that, am I understanding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Yeah, I mean, just, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| I just feel like we're in this transitional phase right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| We haven't really implemented any of the changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| This one, I think it's a legacy thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| and I get the impression it's somewhat time sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| I know, because they just met with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| or pardon me, the county, and donated 100 plus acres to Legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| Parks to try to do some stuff with respect to Bowers Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| So, anyway, I'm just trying to understand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| if we need to move forward or if it's postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| I guess my question is, can we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3342)|
| 0:55:50| On the plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Can we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3355)|
| 0:56:04| And there's a lot of work that's gone into this that I personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| I've kind of watched into this, and I just wondered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| why we couldn't move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| I will say, I don't, and Mike, please correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| if I might have my details incorrect here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| but the plan amendment was not actually submitted back in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| for this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| It had a sector plan amendment application, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| It was for a slightly smaller area than they are requesting now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| but it did require a sector plan amendment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| And ultimately, it's county commission's decision whether or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| I mean, they also have to agree to hear it and when to hear it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| So if you all were to move forward with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| it would go to county commission and they would have final action on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| either to hear it or to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| So I'll just say maybe as a slight point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| this might be helpful for you all to understand how it ended up on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| So initially, as we had just said, it came in with a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| and so because the sector plan is no longer in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| we had to replace that file number, issue a new file number for the plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| but because it had been postponed as it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| it was on the schedule for this particular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| but the file number got changed to a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| But then the recommendation pressed to postpone it is to align it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| with when its counterparts are going to be heard in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| I don't know if that's helpful for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| I guess somewhat, but I guess that's part of where I was coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| It's kind of a legacy thing that's been hanging around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| It was tabled, it was taken off, and there was a request made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| Now we're under some new rules, but the application was made before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| Anyway, I know it's a bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| Yeah, and to that point, Commissioner Huber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| so in the city, since we've been doing quarterly amendments for a very long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| so someone can request a plan amendment in the appropriate month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| that it's expected to be heard, and for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| it can end up on the table or it can end up being postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| That doesn't prevent it from being heard in the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| or in 60 or 90 days when it comes back up on your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| even if it doesn't exactly align with that quarterly amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3499)|
| 0:58:37| So I was asking Director Brooks there for the clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| that it could be heard in an off time other than the four designated meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3521)|
| 0:58:54| Okay, so we will move on to agenda item number 29, 7H24DP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3534)|
| 0:59:04| I just wanted to introduce this to you real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| There was opposition, and I signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| So I just wanted to get this in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| just so you know what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| This is a four-lot subdivision on the backside of an existing condominium development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| The condominium were approved back in 2003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| and constructed a little bit after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| There was this backside of the property that's always remained undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| For reference, where this is located, it's off of Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| just northeast of Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| So back in 2016, there was an approval, or I guess a request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| for a 23-lot subdivision on the site that was withdrawn in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| It came back for 22 lots, which was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| That subdivision never went forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| This site has a lot of stormwater-related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| Not necessarily this site, but downstream from this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| there's a lot of water that passes through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| So that's one of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| I guess a four-lot subdivision here, or larger lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| kind of helps with that whole problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| Staff is recommending approval subject to four conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| which are just basic conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| There's one condition that's a little bit of an oddball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| which is that there can't be commercial uses on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| Really, that is just to put a front and center clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| which would have been required anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| The only reason why I put it in there is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| they do have a fairly large accessory structure on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Just want to make sure that everyone's clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| you can use that for personal purposes, no problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| but it does need to be used for personal use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| not for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| I guess there is another condition that the accessory structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| cannot exceed the size of the conditioned space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| of the house as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Accessory structures are to be secondary to the primary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3667)|
| 1:01:14| so it really shouldn't be bigger than the proposed house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| I think they're going to be fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| but it is a fairly large structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| so I just wanted to make sure that they were aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| Real quick, like I said, this is on plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| up to 5 dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| It's on the backside of an existing subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| Sorry, that's not the right slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| It is suburban residential on the land use map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| by the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| It does recommend single family uses as a primary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| I just wanted to show this real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| so from a stormwater perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| and you probably saw on the site plan itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| that there was a fairly large drainage area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| that goes straight through the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| That water does continue on through adjacent properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| and then goes all the way down to Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| I think a lot of the flooding kind of happens down in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| closer to Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| I could be mistaken, but there's a lot of water flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| that goes here, so I'm sure you'll hear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| in the discussion during the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| The applicant will be required to install some new pipes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| under an adjacent driveway as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| as part of their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| Quick one, Mike, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| So they've got to install new pipes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| but are they going to do any type of detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| additional detention, or does it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| I think their intent is to stay under the detention threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| I'm not sure if you have a question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| Yeah, Commissioner Eber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| they're going to use the large lot exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| and I think they're doing some pavers as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| so that they will be under the threshold for detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| I just know there's been a lot of complaints over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| on Tazewell Pike and flooding in that area, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3791)|
| 1:03:20| Any other questions regarding this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3800)|
| 1:03:28| Number 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| This is 6B24UR, Easy Stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| So this request is a use on review application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| because they're requesting three separate uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| that are listed in the CN zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| the Neighborhood Commercial Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| that are listed as uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| So those uses do have to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| before they can be permitted on a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| The three separate uses are a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| a gas station, and a drive-through facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| So the Planning Commission can approve all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| They can deny all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| They can...you can approve two of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| and deny one of them if you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| or you can add conditions of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| if you care to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| The specific development details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| they are proposing a 7,715-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| That's broken into two separate areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| 4,600-square-foot convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| and 3,115-square-foot restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| There's seven gas pumps, so 14 points of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| Access is to 2nd Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| They need to widen 2nd Drive to about 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| and provide a sidewalk along their frontage of 2nd Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| And they also have an access to Concord Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| which is right in, right out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| and includes a deceleration lane in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3896)|
| 1:05:04| The recommendation is to approve the proposed uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| with 14 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| So I'm just going to go over a few of the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| of note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| And these colors on here have nothing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| with anything other than I was trying to highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| the different conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| and make it a little bit easier to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| Number one, the first condition was to provide a firewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| between retail convenience store and the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| so that each use is contained within a separate building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| per the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| And I'll go over that in just a little bit in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| but there's some requirements in the CN Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| regarding building and business size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| that need to be adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| Number two, the staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| no more than four pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| So that would be two points of sale per pump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| so it would be eight points of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| Number nine, all site lighting should be building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| or pole-mounted no higher than 15 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| with the exception of the lights under the canopy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| the gas canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Number 10, the drive-thru facility should be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| Number 11, drive-thru outdoor speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| shall meet the following operation standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| I'm not going to go through those one by one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| but the intent is to try to minimize the sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| as much as possible that would creep over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| into the adjacent residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| Just to orient everybody, so the star is the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| It's on Concord Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| It's adjacent to historic Concord Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| To the south is North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| If you're familiar with North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| there's the roundabout at Concord Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| So Concord Road goes up to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| I'm sorry, this is Concord Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| This is North Campbell Station, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| or maybe South Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| Zoom in a little bit more with the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| The area on the west side of Concord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| is in the city of Farragut or town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| As I mentioned before, this is adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| to the historic village of Concord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| which is the hatched area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| It does have a local historic zoning overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4046)|
| 1:07:34| The second drive is south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| It does extend back into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| It's approximately 15 feet wide now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| Like I said, it does have to be widened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| if this request is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| The site is primarily vegetated now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| It says that their site is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| A lot of comments from the public so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| had to do with the cemetery and concern with the cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| protecting the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| I just wanted to point out where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| There is a historic Masonic Lodge, I believe it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| Concord Road has recently been widened by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| It's a four-lane facility now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| with the central median, the turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| Part of the tough part with this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| is the intent of the neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| It provides the opportunity to locate limited retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| and service uses in a manner convenient to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| and yet not disruptive to established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| It's intended to provide for the recurring shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| and personal service needs of nearby residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| Development should be compatible with the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| of adjacent subdivision or adjacent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| This is where we're having a little bit of a rub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| It's a fairly decent-sized project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| How to fit this within the intent of the CN Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| which is to provide limited services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| to adjacent residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| It's on a four-lane Concord facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| It does have a lot of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| but it is still adjacent to neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| and trying to best match it to the zoning that it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| That's where a lot of the staff-recommended conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| come in, trying to reduce the amount of pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| try to reduce lighting height, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| Things to try to help reduce the nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| to adjacent residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| and try to get it more into conformance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| with the intent of the zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| The next part I have on here is dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| the building size regulations in the CN Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| It's kind of unique to the CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| No building can be no more than 35 feet in height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| which is pretty typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| But the second part says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| no individual building or commercial establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| shall have a floor area exceeding 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| So they have a building that's 7,000 square feet plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4210)|
| 1:10:17| and it is one owner, one business essentially here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| but they are two separate types of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| So the staff recommendation is to require a firewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| between the two uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| so it essentially creates two buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| even though they're connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| which then brings it in conformance with the CN Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4238)|
| 1:10:49| So you can see the interior layout as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| On the right is the Easy Stop convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| On the left is the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| Currently, they show a wall between the two uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| It does have a door connector between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| There are separate points of sale for each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| They do have separate restrooms, for instance, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| but it is still operated by one entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4274)|
| 1:11:24| The CN Zone does have pretty extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| They are intending to maintain up to 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| or close to 25 feet of existing vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| along the rear property line adjacent to the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| You'll see that it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| it's not consistent across the entire rear property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| but it is, they're trying to maintain as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| There is a condition that they, during the permitting stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| they document the trees that are existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| and may ensure that what's maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| and what's installed ultimately meets the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| of the screening standard of the CN Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| Otherwise, there'd be a much deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| and more extensive new landscaping involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| evergreen trees and deciduous trees and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| but they're trying to maintain as much existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| mature vegetation and then supplement that mature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| existing vegetation with some new to fill in the gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| But it's just not detailed enough at this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| to say whether it's going to meet the intent as shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| or if they're going to have to modify that just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4351)|
| 1:12:39| And I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| We've got a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| First one with the firewall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| Jim, can you confirm that that will actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| that the Knox County zoning will allow that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| to be two separate buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| Yeah, we've talked about this one a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| I think in the past it has been interpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| a little bit different, but in our position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| from a building code or IBC perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| we believe that a firewall does create two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| One can burn down, the other one can be standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| So, yes, from our perspective, we would feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| a firewall would meet the intent of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| I just wanted to confirm that because that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| what the IBC says, but I've seen a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| where the zoning code did not recognize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| as a way to separate two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| My other question, Mike, you mentioned in the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| the drive-through speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| Is it possible to include something about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| just outdoor speakers in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| There's two situations that come to mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| and while we have the ability to add in conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| One, music speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| There's a gas station out of town that we stop at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| frequently when we're visiting to see family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| and the music speakers are so loud that it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| wake up the kids sometimes in the car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| and I can't imagine being a neighbor to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Two, though, a lot of gas stations now have the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| like, TV screens on the pumps that sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| can be really loud, and so since this is a CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| I would want to make sure that not just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| drive-through speakers are not getting out of hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| but also other outdoor speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| Yeah, I can put something together as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| We can also ask the applicant if they have plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| for any types of outdoor speakers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| Yeah, we can look at, as Mike mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| we can prepare some options for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| but that would be a motion that you would need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| during the meeting on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Can you explain how you came to four pumps instead of seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| There is no rhyme or reason other than that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| the more appropriate scale for a smaller type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| of neighborhood-oriented station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| I mean, it could be two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| Four seemed reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| I guess I can comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| That was going to be one of my questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Because, I mean, Concord Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| and I don't want to get into deliberation right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| that's not what I'm trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| but it's a different kind of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| I did a development in Neighborhood Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| a little further out up there at the corner of North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| and Choteau Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Much, much, much more residential out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| I did a deal with Mr. Weigel, and he does have four rows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| It's a total of eight pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| so I'm assuming this would be 14 pumps if it were seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| eight again if it were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| But to me, this is a little bit different of an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| I mean, TDOT just spent $20 million or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| on widening out that whole road right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| so it's a pretty much more commercial thoroughfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| although it is Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| I do think we need to respect Neighborhood Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| because it's not Zone CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| We need to stay in Neighborhood Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| I mean, four might be a little restrictive for me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| But also, with the right turn only going on to 2nd Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| I think it is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Can you explain a little bit of where that's coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| Just trying to reduce as much cut through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| through the neighborhood as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I don't think this development is really key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| towards pushing people down 2nd Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| Anybody that lives in that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| or historic Concord Village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| can turn right onto Concord Road pretty easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| and then get back on loop for a little bit up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| and then back into the neighborhood if they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| I think that's to try to get people back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| towards Concord Road as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| Yeah, and I'm curious about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| because I recall, again, when I went through all of my zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| and design for markets at Jodo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| everybody's like, oh gosh, that's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| we'll never use that, we won't ever come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| The neighbors that were opposed at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| now they all love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| They want more restaurants and more commerce out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| Rich knows, he lives out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| But my point with that is, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| you're forcing the people who live the closest to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| where, to me, Neighborhood Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| is to support the people who live closest to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| which would include the folks down that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| down 2nd Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| So you're allowing them to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| but yet you're forcing them out to the main road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| instead of coming out and then going back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| Yeah, I mean, I think that that's a minor component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| of the recommendation overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| So I'm not sure how many people would turn left out of there anyways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| but the point is trying to keep that to a minimum as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| because you could, if somebody was going back to Loop Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| they could just decide, rather than trying to get onto Concord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| where it's busy and a lot of high-speed traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| coming out of that loop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| just to go through the neighborhood instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| So it's just trying to force people back to Concord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| I've got two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| The first one is about the size of the building and the firewall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| I hear what you said, Mr. Snowden, about that being to fit the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4731)|
| 1:19:00| but does that fit the zone, like the intent of the CN zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| Because it seems like if the requirement was 5,000 or less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| and this structure is a single structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| even though it has a firewall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| the feeling of it in that community is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| it's going to be more of a big box feeling rather than a small feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| Yeah, that's a bit of a challenge for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| I think at least splitting the two uses as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| is what the intent there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| They could split this into two separate buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| and meet the code just fine and not have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| So separating it by a firewall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| while it's still two connected buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| it's at least two separate uses or buildings by at least the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| building code, and provides, as Director Snowden mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4797)|
| 1:20:06| it at least gets it into compliance as much as possible with the CN zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4806)|
| 1:20:13| and the international building code too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| The other, I'm not sure if this is for Mr. Snowden or you, Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| because if you haven't read this yet in the comments that came through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| there was a very extensive and as probably close a parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| as we'll be able to get in terms of an apples-to-apples to this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| is one that's already taken place on Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| and Weigel's location there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| There's a lot of documentation in terms of the sound impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| from the vehicles themselves, from the radios and speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| It does not have a drive-through, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| So this one would actually be a little more intensive than that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| The lighting and the landscaping and things that essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| weren't ever actually done that were supposed to have been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| and it fell back onto the resident there to pay for and deal with the impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4873)|
| 1:21:20| And so my question is about what measures exist for really holding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4880)|
| 1:21:29| the development's feet to the fire to follow through on the landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| the lighting, all of those things that are here as conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| but there's a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| I don't know what the conditions were exactly in the previous one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| but there were specific items listed as it's supposed to be this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| here's a picture, several years later, never been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| So how is that actually held to a standard to get done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4909)|
| 1:21:57| And I might look to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| And Mike can jump in too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Yes, Commissioner Adams, we hold, before we'll issue a CO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| we do require that landscape to be in place or a bond in place to ensure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| And a lot of trespass is always something we get into a lot in the zoning world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| So we will, we can issue citations and bring forth injunctions potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| against that landowner if they don't comply with what the terms and conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| of the MPC staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| And it is something that my building codes department does quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4956)|
| 1:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| I have a question about, I guess, whether the extent that it's legal for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4965)|
| 1:22:52| to impose conditions that aren't necessarily in the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| because it's my understanding that the number of gas pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| the lighting and something else aren't requirements in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| And it's also my, I'm an employment lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| so I'm not trying to act like a genius here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| but it's my understanding that under Tennessee law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| we can't just arbitrarily impose conditions that aren't in some capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| within the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| And then there's a recent Supreme Court case about takings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| constitutional takings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| And so I guess I'm just concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| or I'm just asking for more clarification on how far we can go with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| because I don't want to make decisions that are arbitrary and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5010)|
| 1:23:43| I can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| Certainly, yes, it's common as part of the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5024)|
| 1:23:52| that we would impose conditions that are site related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Now, there is legal constraints associated with conditioning uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| Like, that's not legal, but in the county code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| you can condition an approval based off of this type of lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5042)|
| 1:24:10| or access here or you're going to provide some additional screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| on this side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| So that is within the purview of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| You want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5063)|
| 1:24:36| Okay, thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| We will move on to your last one here, one in North Shoretown Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5077)|
| 1:24:48| I'll touch on this just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| So this is a request to increase the maximum height for townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| in North Shoretown Center residential development from 35 feet to 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| approximately 41 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| I say approximate because I'm kind of judging where the average grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| on the eastern most townhouses is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| But basically, the way I've written it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| the approval language is that they have to meet or approving this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| so the way I've written it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| So they can't start adjusting it taller if they had a few inches to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| So background is this property, North Shoretown Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| was rezoned in 2001 in the city to the town center, TC1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| 2004, there was a master plan and development standards approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| 2018, there were some minor modifications to the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| or to development standards associated with the residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Didn't really have anything to do with height for townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| or anything like that, but just some other tweaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| And then in 2022, there was a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| I'll only mention this one because it's adjacent or directly across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| from this proposed site, so it's semi-relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| There was a proposal to increase the maximum lot size for townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| from 4,500 square feet to a little over 6,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Basically, they took two townhouse lots, combined them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| and made one large townhouse or wider townhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| And staff recommendation is to approve as presented in the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| So all four of these townhouses exceed the 35-foot height maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5185)|
| 1:26:34| The Planning Commission has the authority to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| just as a consideration on this site, so it's not like a variance necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| like a board of zoning appeals type of variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| You kind of look at it as like a modification to their design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| and what the maximum height could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| Just real quick from an aerial standpoint, this is North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| North Shore Drive, Pell City Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| If you're familiar out here, there's the target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| So this lot is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| It's right behind the target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| So again, it's this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| It's surrounded by townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| The townhouses to the right on the image are the same townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| During the review of those, we missed the height maximum on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| so they are being constructed as proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| as you see in this development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| I think they're about 38 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| They're permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| They're under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| Height is measured from the average grade of the ground in front of the unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| to the top of the highest point of a flat roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| So in this case, these are flat roofs, so it'll be up to the highest point of the flat roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| If this was a pitched roof, it'd be halfway up the pitched roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| So the tip of the pitched roof would actually be taller than 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| It would be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| So this is a different angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| So again, these to the left, if you went out to North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| and drove around, these units are almost complete now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| So you'd be able to see what the end product of this proposal would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5296)|
| 1:28:24| Existing townhouses on the same street, so this is just to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| So if I went back to this image, it's these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| The way that we've interpreted height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| so the building height in North Shore Town Center allows 2 1⁄2 stories and 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5314)|
| 1:28:42| The way we've interpreted with the townhouses is that we've allowed them to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| So you can see, like, this is three stories tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| Basically, this third story can only be a partial story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| It can't be the full footprint of the floor below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| We allow them to go 2 1⁄3 of the footprint below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| If you were trying to do a true 2 1⁄2-story house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| with the half story being underneath the pitched roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| you're probably going to get a maximum of 2 1⁄3 of the floor below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| So that's how we came to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| But they still have to meet the 35-foot height maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| And for reference, on these units to the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| the height is to the actual roof, not the parapet wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| So from the street, these units are actually feel taller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| because they have a parapet wall that goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| So the height is just to the roof itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| So this is an image of the streetscape of that, those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| And then these are the units across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Those are the more typical two-story with a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| These do have the third level roof amenity space as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| You just can't see it in this image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| It's kind of hard to see in this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| but I've got a measurement line drawn here to a red line below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| which is approximately the average grade for this unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| It's about 40 feet, not quite 41 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| And then the other three units to the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| are about a little bit less than 40 feet tall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| to the very top of the upper roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| These units have a basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| They have main level, second level, and third level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| So they are four-story units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| It's not atypical for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| There are several townhouses that have a very similar layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| It's just that these units have a taller basement level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| than the other ones, evidently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| The...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| If I go back to the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| you'll see that the sites are very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| This is the alley behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| I can't remember how far these are off the alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| if they're, like, less than 10 feet, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| I mean, they're very small sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| so they're cramming these units in as best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| And I guess maximizing the space as much as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| So they can't really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| If they push down the building to get the height lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| then they're going to have some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| probably with some water on the backside of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| that might be able to handle that with some storm drainage, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| And their floor elevation would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| Their basement floor elevation would end up lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| than the alley behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| So it's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| I'm sure there's a way to handle that if they need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| but I just wanted to make you aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| that if they need to push it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| they are going to be going down lower than the adjacent alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| This is the site elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| And, again, what the recommendation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| Yeah, I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| I don't have any problem at all with what we're talking about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| I think it's a very unique concept that they've come up with out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| in the North Shore Town Center, and it's done very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| It's a high-quality product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| Mine's more of a question about the scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| Is there not a scenic highway that runs down through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| So it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| and some of the other city zoning at that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| are explicitly exempt from the building height standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| and scenic highway legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| That's all I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| Are there other items that commissioners would like to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| If not, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240709?start=5569)|
